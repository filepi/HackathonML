0,"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Company A and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them."
1,"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them."
2,There appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire.  I have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you.  This is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price.
3,"They aren't wide-angle as advertised. They don't fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses, so one always sees double. I had several friends try them and they all said the same thing, so it isn't just me. With a name brand like Bushnell I thought I couldn't go wrong, but apparently their quality control is non-existent. I ordered these while traveling out west and couldn't send them back until I got home. I tried to return them, but Company A said the last return date was one day before, so I am stuck with these useless binoculars. I need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them."
4,"The angled picture of the ends of this cable make it hard to tell, but the connectors do not have the trapezoidal shape required for any of the digital cameras I own (JVC Everio,Canon Powershot, Olympus). The cable appears to be well made but is useless unless you're connecting to Sony."
5,"I ordered this to protect my NEX kit lens, and as much as I would like to know how well it works, they sent me an empty package. I have the Tiffen filter case, and nothing in it. Thanks for nothing. Literally."
6,"I think this thing is a real piece of junk, it's been a while since I bought it(i didn't hook it up right away)but I may try to return it. It's looks pretty cheap, you can't clearly tell if you selected a speaker or not by the internal red marks in window, like solid or blank, they don't really move that much. And now after just a few weeks the button selector is starting to not even change (on or off) when I push it.Other relieves of this product were good, so I took a chance on it. But I would recommend against it now."
7,Wireless range on this is weak. I have an intel card that reads 4/5 bars when this adapter reads 2/5 bars. I like netgear equipment but can't recommend this adapter.
8,"I'm quite near TV transmitters so a decent signal should not be too hard to find. Though a couple of channels came in reasonably strongly on the TV-55 reception is very poor over most of its range and the included amplifier make absolutely no discernable difference to anything. How poor is the performance? Well, I got a better picture on a wider range of channels by touching my own thumb to the coax connector than by leaving the TV-55 connected. Since my old rabbit ears get far better reception for less money than it will cost to return this dud to Company A.com, I'll stick with them for now."
9,"DO NOT BUY THIS!! I thought I found the finishing piece I was looking for for my new computer - boy did I ever fall for it.  Does not work at all and their are no drivers for it from Belkin, MicroSoft, or any of the sellers!!"
10,"I ordered one of these with several other cables, but when I opened the box it wasn't there.Hey Cables to Go, would you mind sending me the little cable I ordered? I sent you a message about it, and you never answered."
11,"Totally different from the picture they show very low quality i will never buy from them again, and it arrive 40 day later."
12,"Absolute garbage of a cable. horrible frequency interruption. I would not recommend this to anyone, and I did return it."
13,"the camera works OK.  The wrist strap is impossible to put on.  I need it since many users need this on the go and it would save the camera from dropping.The wrist strap was so frustrating, that we wanted to throw it out the window.There is also no case.Can't really recommend it since it gave us so much initial frustrations."
14,"They are f'ing gray not white.They slapped a label over the one that reads gray usb 1.1 standard.the new  label reads white usb 2.1 standard.wrong color a problem.worse they do not support  my keyboard an apple wired type.I don't want to bothered with a return for a lousy low cost item like this.  even if i got free shipping the trip to the post office to mail it cost me more then they are worth.  when a company does this type of mislabel I get so annoyed.  It cost me time and aggravation.  For what an item that is well under 10 bucks.  well if you want gray cables that don't work with apple keyboards buy these "" white "" ones. This  company should be avoided there is no way the over label of white 2.1 usb can be an accident.  they are just hoping People don't return them.  Thanks for nothing but more work for a lousy few bucks."
15,"DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!DO NOT BUY!I picked the box up off the porch, heard a clunk and my heart sank.Like another reviewer mentioned, I opened the box to see the tweeter plate vacant of the tweeter which was rolling around inside the cabinet. From the reviews, I was under the impression that BIC was quality and have coveted these speakers for a while. Now, having placed a replacement order, I'm hesitant to get my hopes up not to mention that these were ordered with careful timing to be home to actually receive them.From what I saw of the cabinet, it looked like a nice speaker, I'm just baffled at the QC. I didn't even bother to unwrap the second to see how they sound. Company A's pays the shipping each way - maybe after enough are shipped back and Company A says something, BIC will have a look at the issue.************************************************************************UPDATE: Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...Second pair arrived in a box that looks like it came from a war zone: blackened with what seems to be Toner Dust, ALL corners crushed, tweeter rattling in the box. The UPS guy saw me carrying this back towards the truck and the guy smiles and roars away. Guilty?Company A - you're paying for this one AGAIN. Returning and never buying BIC."
16,"My biggest complaint is that the local AM stations are not tuning in at the proper number on the dial. Of four regular stations in the area, this radio only picks up two.  The two stations I do get, can be tuned in at the lower numbers on the dial and then again at the higher numbers but not at the number it should be. I have had better luck with five dollar transitor radios."
17,"I have been using Sony Cd-Rs for years now without any problems.  However, when I stumbled across some very bad reviews of Sony here on Company A, I decided to give Memorex disks a try when I saw them on sale.Boy, I should have listened to myself when I said I was going to stick with Sony. Not one of the Memorex CD-Rs would burn (using my Midnight PC). I went through about 5 in a row. Not one! The minute I popped in a Sony disk, it burned as smooth as butter, so I knew it couldn't be corrupted data as the problem; it had to be the Memorex disks.  I immediately dumped the brand new Memorex spindle with the remaining 45 blank CDs in the trash. $8 (at least it was a very good sale) wasted.  I didn't even bother testing the others.  I wouldn't buy a computer with the expectation that it will only work 95% of the time and I don't buy disks with the same expectation.  When I buy something new, I expect 100% of it to work 100% of the time.Perhaps it is true that some disks will not work on all machines.  Who knows.  All I know is Memorex doesn't work on mine but Sony has worked flawlessly on every computer and CD player I have ever used them on.  So that's it for me. I will never deviate from what I know to be true again. For all I know Memorex reps could be the ones writing those bad reviews of Sony. LOL!Sony has been infallible for me and with Sony I shall remain.  Memorex is in the trash right where it belongs."
18,"This coax cable seems to be well made, it's very flexible and was easy to install. I used this cable to replace an old cable that had to be spliced to make it long enough. Much to my surprise the cable exhibited terrible signal loss (it decreased from -6dbi to -13dbi). I wound up having the cable company come out to install their shielded RG6 cable and there wasn't any signal loss at all. Buyer beware..."
19,"Doesn't look anything like the picture.  It is a VERY heavy dual cable which might be fine for a fixed stereo system, but not for use in extending headphones.  So heavy that it disconnects from my laptop. It's going back."
20,"With 476 reviews, I guess I'm not gonna make much of a difference. But the microphone on this item (both mine and my wife's) is so bad that it's almost useless. I have to practically put the pickup IN my mouth to be heard on many connections.  I tried it without the foam cover, but no improvement.  My AT&T; speakerphone picks up my voice much better from two feet away than this microphone does from two inches!So, after 5 months of struggling with the microphone touching my lips, I need to give up on these and buy two headsets of a different brand -- heard good things about the $20 Plantronics.Why wasn't this reported in any other reviews? Did we get TWO defective units? Has Panasonic degraded the quality since those reviews?"
21,"We've tried all types and they all after working well initially, break within about a month. We use them in our office and they should be labeled disposable as that is what they are. also the retaining clip opposite the headset always gets caught in your hair...."
22,"I started to pass up the chance to rate this until I saw how high the overall rating is.  The user group on the NETGEAR www site documents how unstable this card is and the dopped internet connection issue.  I agree with all those who mention ease of installing etc.- then BAMM! After about 2 months, internet connectivity becomes an issue.  I had not been to the NETGEARS users group before.  Before buying this item go to their web site and search for ""internet drop"".  Lots of customers are dissatisfied with this card-BEWARE! I have tried lots of fixes-uninstalling/reinstalling/using the NETGEAR Mgr/using the WIN XP mgr-nothing seems to work. Untold hours spent.  This is my last gasp-now searching for a Linksys replacement as recommended by others."
23,"Four months after I purchased it, this wouldn't turn on one day. Sony refuses to stand by its products, and it sticks to a $150 flat rate labor fee since the warranty is only three months. I greatly enjoyed this camera for a few months and recommended it often, but when I called Sony, its own technician referred to it as ""fragile."""
24,"Out of 3 units, 2 were trashed beyond use (flashing power light)by the LinkSys firmware upgrade.Cisco should have taken hold by now and not permitted suchatrocious programming.The WET11 bridge has its own quality assurance problems,but is nothing close to as bad as the WET54GThe one good unit (on firmware version 2.05) locked up andneeded rebooting after a week sitting around not doing much.I cannot belive a company would be willing to risk its reputationwith such shoddy products..."
25,"Two exact units failed, love the incessant beeping... wonderful.  Not worth the time or money, find a unit that has good reviews and save the heartache."
26,"I bought this to use with my Skype (free internet phone service). I  had high expectations and was happy with the low price. This product turned out to be horrible. After a couple months, three problems:1. Only the right ear of the headset is working now,2. The little volumn control thing is bad, it does not change volumn smoothly and you have to carefully turn it to some specific place for it to make the right noise.3. Connection to the computer not good. I have to press down on the connector with my fingers to hear anything.DO NOT BUY THISI am editing this review, because this pair of earphones just completely went broke on me. I am angry!!!!!!!!!!!!"
27,"Without getting technical, these things just hurt to wear. I've been wanting a pair of on ear, or over ear headphones. I went cheap and got these. I can't listen to them for more than 15 minutes without getting a headache. I have a pair of skull candy titan ear buds that sound so much better than these. They aren't exceptionally comfortable either, but I can wear them for a few hours at least. The sound from these Sony's sounds muffled to me. Back to the drawing board. Trying to find the right pair with a great sound, great comfort, and great price. These definitely aren't them."
28,"Decent quality buds but the cord system is God-awful. If you don't use the extension, the cord is only like a foot long so you can't have your iPod or whatever in your pocket. If you use the extension, it's adds another 3 feet and it's way too long, not to mention you have to use an adapter to plug into a standard mini jack in any MP3 player. Ridiculous. Total waste of money, wish I'd bought the next model up."
29,Did I mention that this keyboard is flexy?  Way too flexy?  It is.  Couldn't use it.  Sent it back.  I don't want to be annoyed while typing.
30,"I had this radar detector for about a month and traded it in for the Escort 9500ix and just let me say going cordless really is not the way to go. The Escort 9500ix outperforms the Solo 2 in every area and is just much easier to use. I got all kinds of false signals with the Solo 2 to the point where you don't know if it's a false signal or a real cop. The battery life is really poor and it's a pain to have to turn the detector on every time you get in the car. I mounted my Escort 9500ix on my visor with the visor clip and hardwired it to my cars fuse box and now it comes on and off when I start my car and the performance is twice that of the Solo 2. Plus the BIG advantage is with the 9500ix you get GPS which records the false signals frequencies and their exact locations so when you go by them three times it erases them so your detector just gets quieter and quieter. NO MORE FALSE SIGNALS! WONDERFUL! Also, it has a database of all the speed cameras and red light cameras so it warns you about those too and it is updatable via USB on your computer so as they add new cameras you are still covered. It tells you with VOICE prompts what kind of radar it is and simultaneously shows your speed at that moment. So before you spend $300.00 on this weak unit go on over to E-bay and pick up the Escort 9500ix for about $400.00 new. That's only $100.00 more and it is money will spent! Here is Mike Valentine talking about why a cordless detector will never perform ,as well as, a corded detector.""There's no cordless version of V1It's possible to run a radar detector on two throw away AAs, but you have to give up any hope of high performance.Performance takes power.  There's no getting around the physics of it. Batteries are weak sources of power. That's why electric cars use battery packs weighing hundreds of pounds, yet few of them can top 100 miles without recharging.Laptop computers have very expensive batteries -- quite heavy, too -- yet they're lucky to run two hours on a charge.A radar detector operates like a sentry making its rounds. If the territory is small, then he can watch carefully and often. Expand the territory and he has time for only quick glances. When ""superwide Ka"" radar guns came on the scene a few years back, the microwave territory a radar detector has to watch was expanded more than 1000 percent, compared to the good old days of X and K bands only. Now the sentry needs powerful circuits.""SOLO S2 uses only a fraction of the power used by conventional corded detectors,"" claims the maker's website.Uh-oh, here comes the energy crisis.The SOLO S2's ""High-Efficiency Power Management"" is hardly rocket surgery. It saves the two AAs by putting the sentry to sleep more than 85 percent of the time. It just switches off the power-using detector circuitry.A sleeping sentry can't possibly give early warning when radar is used in the instant-on mode. And it gives up all hope of detecting the POP mode.Sure, a cordless detector would be convenient. And I'll be out in the lab cooking one up as soon as the laws of physics are repealed.""Stick with a corded detector and you will be more satisfied than with an uncorded one like the Solo 2."
31,"OK it might be functional but the plastic odor coming from this item reeked and was so strong that I did not want to put it in my camera bag. The odor has lasted for months.  Are you folks aware that chemicals that outgass from electronics and plastics such as the ""new car smell"" are hazardous to your health?  One item will not do you in, but most of us have  gadget collections and the total collection of volatile chemicals can over time impact your health in subtle ways you may not recognize as due to these chemicals (fatigue, rashes, ""brain fog"", mood swings, etc.).  I do my best to stay away from smelly gadgets for that reason, I would have returned it but the cost was less than postage.  Manufacturers should not make products that pollute the user's environment. Which do you value more, a cheap but functional mini tripod or your health?"
32,I took a chance after reading the split reviews on this antenna.  Current reviews were running almost 50/50 with this antenna either being the best thing out there or a piece of crap.  For me it's a piece of crap.  The stock antenna does a better job.  I started by setting it next to the receiver - nope.  Laid it down flat - little better but still no.  Mounted it up on the wall - nope.  Ran it out the window and pointed it in the direction of the station I was trying to pick up - not any better.  The signal continually goes in and out every two to three minutes.  With the stock antenna I only have to put up with a dropped signal every 45 minutes or so.So yep - boxed back up and ready to send back.  Know that if you decide to purchase this you have no better than a 50/50 shot of it performing.
33,"First of all, let me state that I'm a systems/network engineer who has built out a wireless internet service provider that covers over 100 square miles.  So, I know a thing or two about networking, both wired and wireless.  In short, this device flat out does not work.  I know some people complain that this device is only 802.11b, but 11Mbps (tops) is perfectly fine for printing, so I thought I was getting something useful cheap.  I was wrong.Two windows laptops and one Mac OS X 10.4.7 laptop can see the Ad-Hoc WLAN-PS network, but cannot connect.  The Mac laptop fails to connect and asks if I want to try again.  One of the Windows laptops tries to connect but will not succeed.  The other connects, but for some tries to get a DHCP network address, even though I used a static address of 192.168.0.5.  Even my Linux desktop couldn't see it.After 3 hours wasted, it's going back to the store.  After this experience, I won't be buy the Dlink 802.11g version, either."
34,"I've gone through three packs of these lousy discs trying to get them to work with a Sony DRU-510A burner and gotten coaster after coaster after coaster after coaster.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!Using Windows 2000 SP4, latest drive firmware update 1.0D, roxio ECDCDv6 with all the latest patches, etc., etc., etc.Although a few discs actually did manage to get recorded, trying to add a new session to those discs destroyed most of those few survivors.  Memorex, Sony, and roxio need to get together and resolve this fiasco.  I've wasted DAYS and DAYS on this nonsense!!!"
35,"These binoculars never really worked. You have to adjust manually and it's really hard to get the correct setting, if you change your position slightly you have to adjust them again. It just gives you a headache and dizziness. Save the money and purchase a better item, these ended in the garbage."
36,"Good pack for a student but not a professional sales rep that travels a great deal. Not enough business card pockets or zipped pockets so lose items don't wander around the bottom. Also not enough pockets for cords, batteries, cables, etc."
37,"Another steller D-Link product.  Works great as long as you don't want to use WEP Encryption.  After going through 5 phone techs, I finally had one level with me, saying ""look, this thing never works with the encryption turned on"".  After that, I called back and the 2nd-Tier phone tech told me the same thing.  Buyer Beware, don't purchase if you want to keep your network WEP turned on!!"
38,"The cables I received are not the ones I ordered in the picture. The video cables in the picture have much larger, more substantial cables than the audio cables, whereas the the ones I received have video cables with the same tiny cables as the audio cable. If this is what I wanted I could have got those for less than half the price of these.Edit - While I didn't get the cables I ordered, the response from CableBuilders was even better than I could have hoped. A definite +1 for how they handled this. Everyone makes mistakes, it's how the mistakes are handled that makes the difference."
39,"This was a piece of crap from the day I received it. I went through several mini plug adapters before realizing it was the cable all along that cut in and out, not the adapters.  Spent $30 (that I intend to recoup from StarTech) on a worthless piece of rubber. Don't waste your money. You can pick one up likely more reliable at 1/10 the price of this turd."
40,The above product details specifying that this product is compatible with a Nano are not correct. The packaging clearly does not list the nano as what it is for (iPod only). I now have purchased a product that is not appropriate for my device. If Company A posted high-resolution images of product packaging this would have been easy to determine.
41,I ordered this product knowing it would be handy and in truth its a great idea. I also ordered the matching batterey holder too.  Both arrived both are sold by same company. But the batterey holder is made in the USA and the card holder is made in China.  The quality control in China is sadly lacking.  The straps where the velcro are adheared too are too short thus keeping you from getting a secure fit and in addition the quality of the velcro must be less as well because they dont stick well.  Returning as junk.  In fact the batterey holder is only slightly larger then a card holder so why have both it will easily work as a card holder too.  Make them all in the USA if you can. If you can do one you can do both here.
42,"The didn't stay on my ears and the rubber caps kept coming off.Poor design, not made for women with small ears."
43,"I went through THREE of these (returned to mfgr twice) before returning for a refund.  The sensor works well but the effective transmission range to receiver was &lt;50' through open air, and signal did NOT penetrate wall or even a glass window.  Since other users report great results, I can only conclude that quality control by mfgr is inadequate."
44,"I was amazed when I took this unit out of the box and saw that it was made in Japan, not in China.  I was expecting a smooth ride with a quality piece of hardware.  I installed the drivers, then plugged in the unit.  Everything came right up, except for sound.  I checked all my connections, played with volume, and then noticed that my laptop's sound was completely non-functional, not just the sound from the Plextor. Rebooting didn't solve the problem.  I had to roll back to a restore point to get my sound back.  I tried once again, this time using the drivers downloaded from Plextor's web site, which were newer than those on the included CD.  Everything came up perfectly, including sound.  I played for about 15 minutes, and then my notebook's sound was gone again.I emailed tech support; their response (after four days) was to reinstall the drivers.  Gee, thanks.  I was very disappointed to have to pack it up and return it to Company A."
45,Is very neet item especiatlly since it is usable with 1:1 speed as well as 2.
46,"I bought this antenna with great hopes, and would have been happy to just get 1 or 2 stations.However, despite a distance of no more than 8 or 9 miles from the transmitting tower, I get exactly nothing.  Not much of a positive investment..."
47,"We bought 5 of these in November.  First one went bad after a week.  Today the second one also went bad on another PC altogether - same problem, the blue light won't come on anymore!!  Technical Support tried to help but, again, the thing just doesn't work, it won't work, or it can't work.  They said send this one back too! I got a replacement the first time, now I just want to send them all back. I don't have the time to waste to putz around with poorly manufactured gear."
48,Set this up on a laptop and let it be.  It fell apart two weeks later after not being touched whatsoever.  Very disappointing.
49,"This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15"" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the ""brick"" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better."
50,Wanted to play Sony DSC-M1 mpeg4 movies.  But audio is blank.  Crap!
51,Make sure you know what it is compatible with! It only works with certain linksys products and they do not tell you this. Could not get it to work with d-link or netgear products!
52,"I bought this cable when one of the pins in my stock cable broke. I used it regularly for 2 months before it just stopped working. I almost threw out my entire adapter because I assumed it couldn't be just the cable because the cable is new. Luckily, I thought to test this cable before I threw out the whole kit and kaboodle. It turns out this cable failed. Poor quality."
53,"We purchased our FIRST Coby DVD player a little over a year ago. We made our decision mainly because we also had a Netflix account and often times received very scratched DVDs - which our old Sony DVD player refused to work with. The reviews here said that this DVD player would play semi scratched DVDs and multi-region DVDs and sure enough we were delighted when  the Coby did. Huzzah!About a month or two after our initial purchase our Coby DVD player started acting...funny. Oftentimes it would refuse to turn on and even worse refuse to eject our disks. Then all of a sudden it would act normal again - for a while we read through the manual thinking perhaps it was something we were doing wrong. Finally after one particular battle in which we tried unsuccessfully to turn on the Coby and eject our Netflix disk we decided our DVD player was insane.I called Coby who tried to walk me through trouble shooting which did not work. Finally they offered to replace our DVD player free of charge...sounds great until they mentioned we would have to pay $25.00 for shipping and handling. We refused, after all we could buy a new one for that price - but why should we? Our DVD player had barely lasted two months! Anyhow, we then decided to call Company A.com who sent us a replacement Coby DVD player free of charge - Thanks Company A!We were ecstatic to get our new Coby and thought this time things would be different, after all the last one was probably a lemon. Things went smoothly until around two months later when the new Coby started to wig our like the old one. It was like the Coby factory employed the same technology as Inspector Gadgets boss...setting the DVD players to self destruct in T-minus two months! So, needless to say we tossed the DVD player and will never buy another cheapo DVD player again. You seriously get what you pay for with Coby!"
54,"I had written a somewhat favorable review of this unit a monthafter initially buying it. A year later and I am compelled torevise my evaluations and warn anybody considering gettingthis thing.Shortly after the 90 day warranty ran out I lost sound in theleft channel. After a search of the Net for related issuesit became obvious there was a design flaw of the jack thathas affected enough owners of the Zen Extra that a Web Pageexists on how to  resolder the connections, a sort of ""do ityourself"" guide.Not wanting to do this I contacted Creative Customer Care tosee if I could get a break on the repair costs. The guy on thephone admitted this as a known problem but said I'd stillhave to pay a$40.00 minimum to get it fixed. Not wanting tosend them any more of my hard earned money,I sent the unitoff to another repair company. A week later I got an E-mailfrom Creative offering to extend the warranty. Blast! Too late!The repair lasted six months before both channels went out. Isent the unit off to Creative to see what they could do. Theanswer? I need to send them $100.00 for a new main board!I told them they can keep the blasted thing. I'm not going to paytwice over for something that never worked well in the firstplace.These hardware issues are just the tip of the iceberg, though.In my first review I took off one star for the clunky softwarepackage. After using it for nearly a year now, I'd take offmore than that. Just be sure to keep a backup of yourmusic library data file because it seems to become corruptedvery easily. It's happened to me when I disconnected theNomad before closing the PlayCenter, and many times forno seemingly good reason. Also have a paperclip handy forreseting the Nomad when it locks up during transferingfiles again, for no seemingly good reason.Consumers, please spend a little extra cash and get somethingof quality. I'm not going to specifically recommend anything,but just go read some reviews of competing players before youbuy."
55,"I bought one from another site.. for about 11 dollars (it was on sale specials.. not anymore) And I bought it for my teacher so that he might be able to lecture easier with wireless... (his laptop is only 10 feet ish away from his laptop..... And it didn't work. It was embarassing when I sent a present for a teacher and doesn't work! So the second day, I gave him my own Logitech M305. which is also a brand new mouse I just had over december...bought a little later... less than a month used. And the Logitech works terrifically for my teacher. It has triple distance with a way smaller receive. Everybody let's screw microsoft until they make something better, competitive in the market...If you don't need long distance... it may be okay. I don't mean to be totally biased. But know that I don't like this mouse. And I'm a budget saver. but my logitech was only $5 cheaper and delivers awesome work! son of a microsoft.."
56,"They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. This one must have been defective."
57,"I saw many bad reviews for this recorder but for the price of $76, the cheapest I could find at this time so I purchased it. The remote was not working and could not set up or program. I could open and close the tray from the recorder without the try but nothing else. Had to return to Company A. No wonder the price is getting cheaper but it will not be worth to try this recorder."
58,"I learned that buying cheap cables is a gamble. Sometimes you get sometimes that works, sometimes you don't. This is the case when I got a cable that doesn't work at all. My 1080p display blinks with this cable every 1 seconds, constantly. Doesn't seem to support the rate."
59,"My recorder broke just after a year.  It won't format, the disc door won't open, etc...  Also, you can't edit your recorder such as erasing the commericals to fit more tv show.  I will not buy another GoVideo product.  However, I do recommend using American Express Blue Cash to buy your electronics.  Their Buyer Assurance program extended the warranty of my purchase by another year.  AE credit my credit card the original purchase price instead of having me get the DVD recorder fix.  I am very happy with AE.  I am going to charge all my purchases with AE from now on.  AE is how every company to run their business."
60,"I should have listened to the prior reviews that stated that this switch was fundamentally flawed and will eventually stop working. It's flawed presumably b/c there's no protection from dust/dirt entering the optical paths, especially b/c it's a simple mechanical switch. Sometimes the switch itself doesn't 'lock' into one of the three paths, forcing you to jiggle with it until the sound gets thru.At any rate, after about 6 months, it started to get really spotty with making the connections. After about 9 months, the unit is toast. It hardly ever works. Only one of the paths works, making it useless as a 'switch'.Spend the extra money for a more solid unit that doesn't have a plethora of orifices for dust to enter through!UPDATE: I bought the Nyrius SW200 & it works like a charm:SW200 Composite Selector Compatible Satellite"
61,"I'd like to change the rating to three stars, but Company A isn't letting me.Anyway, this unit does what it's supposed to, but some things could still be improved even though this is a fourth generation unit.1. The screen scratches easier than any electronic device I have ever owned. Beware of slipping it in your pocket as-is, because there will probably be something in there that will scratch it and eventually make the screen hard to read. A protective cover is pretty much a necessity, and the one I have (Kensington silicone rubber) is a dust magnet and makes the screen look pretty lousy, no matter how much I attempt to clean it. Maybe a piece of clear packing tape would work better?2. If you're the type of person who likes to keep a large music library and keep tabs on the folders and filenames yourself, then iIunes might rub you the wrong way, and with an iPod you have few other software choices (I hear that Winamp can do it, which if true would be a godsend). My Ipod also has some connectivity issues with WinXP Pro, but it works if I fiddle with it. Being a computer geek, or having one available, may be helpful when using this device.3. The advertised battery life is COMPLETELY, WILDLY INACCURATE if you spend a lot of time skipping between songs, using the backlight, or generally fiddling with it as you are likely to do with a new toy. You may want to get yourself a car charger.4. It is small, holds a ton of music, sounds great (IF you put high quality files on it, duh) and will be a fine companion on any commute or road trip. Just handle with care."
62,"I had my brother purchase this so he could receive the points on his Company A card. The screen arrived in a package nowhere near sturdy enough to protect it. After waiting a few weeks to mount it, I decided to go ahead and pull it out to see what it looked like. The screen material shows significant ripples, the entire body is torqued so that the end caps are off axis from each other by about 20 degrees, there were dings along it's length, and to top it off the brackets were warped.I'm trying to decide if it is worth my money to send it back, or if I'm just going to try and deal with it. I currently have it rolled out on the floor to see if the screen will relax (it hasn't after a week, in fact it looks worse) with weights on either end to try and torque the length of it back into shape.I would NOT buy from these folks again, nor would I recommend them to a friend, unless they want to do something about it.On the bright side, it was only ~150$ different from the painted screen I was going to do, so I'm not out that much.Update 4/11The material has not relaxed, and the axis torsion has gotten worse. It appears the housing material is such flimsy sheet metal that the recoil spring is actually twisting the whole casing. After attempting to stretch the material by giving slight pressure to the handle I heard a ripping noise but don't see any visible tears. I would not ever buy another roll up screen from these people.Update 4/23After nearly being killed during mounting this screen due to the warped brackets I decided to contact support. They were fast and courteous, and offered to replace the screen even though it had fallen. RMA is in process will update when new screen arrives. +2 stars for service!Update 4/30After making me cut a hole in my screen they told me they won't have any in for 6 months. Are you ****ing kidding me?Update 10/22After fighting with their support and threatening to report them to Company A they offered me a slightly larger screen in the wrong aspect ratio. It barely fit, and delayed the contractor for my theater room.The quality is only OK, and there are definitely hot-spots when viewed at certain angles (viewing from 10-20 ft, 0 to +/- 20 degrees).The material is picky, and will sag if left open too long, or get wavy if left up for too long. I've found a 50% open / closed duty cycle to minimize this effect.For all of the price an headache, and having seen a painted screen, and tensioned screens, I would say avoid this product at all costs. It simply isn't worth the effort."
63,"I think the designers of this camera spent so much time making it look cute and slick that they forgot to actually try it out.I returned mine in 3 days.  It was the biggest piece of junk I've ever bought.  The picture quality stunk.  My old 2 MP Sony took pictures 10 times crisper.  There were problems with the focus.  The flash was weak.  It'll illuminate your subject's face, but forget about background.  Indoors, the backgrouund will come out all black.  It's garbage.If you're considering buying this camera, you're better off choosing something of comparable price with  your eyes shut."
64,"I bought the SD-5970 two months ago to replace a very, very reliable Panasonic DVD player (five years old) that I ""fried"" by carelessly placing it on top of a receiver.  As related in other reviews, the remote (with awkwardly placed buttons) is sluggish to the point of thinking the batteries are perpetualy dead.  I lived with that.  Then, after a month, DVDs that used to play no longer play in the machine, displaying ""BAD.""  Indeed, nothing plays. ""Setup"" also no longer works.  Pair this with the class action lawsuit against Toshiba for my laptop computer ... and I caution consumers against buying any of their products.  I expected more from a Japanese electronics company."
65,"The specially designed ""LCD Cleaning Solution"" is pure Isoproply Alcohol and nothing more. As for the brush and cleaning pads, the brush completely and utterly suck. Does not brush anything away, only moves dust from one place to another. Your better off using a cloth to clear dust away. The pads don't do a good job of cleaning anything. It takes way to much time to clean, about 10 or more minutes of wiping. Your better off buying a micro cloth and Alcohol."
66,"after a couple months of use, the head phone jack broke and I could hardly hear any sound, i sent it in for repair. i was happy again, but just for 2 months because the darn thing broke again, but my warrenty was alredy over. I need a new mp3 player. Not sure if this is a common problem or just with creative products. I didn't want apple ipod players, but I think I might switch to the other side. UPDATE: I found a website explaining how you can fix it by using a soldering iron. I have never used a soldering iron before, but i went out and bought one and fixed it. If I was able to fix mine, I'm pretty sure you can fix yours too. I'm a girl.Update September 4, 2006: After fixing it with the soldering iron, the problem came back about a month later. i probably didn't fix it that well and the headphone jack thing became loose. Heck, I don't know. I don't care. I need a new mp3 player for my bus ride to school. For sure it's not going to be a creative product."
67,"I bought this PRe-N Router, PRe-N PCI card, and PRe-N PCCard for a desktop and notebook. Two of the three products were DOA (dead on arrival). Every time, I would place the PCI card in the slot, the desktop (a new Midnight) would not boot.I spent several hours on holdwith Belkin, no one would answer with hours of hold time. Finally the call would just disconnnect.  Finally I returned them to the supplier and got replacements. Now the router would get obtain an IP address from Verizon DSL. No matter what I tried.. it just would not work. If I called tech support.. of course.. same problem no one would answer.Also, trying to set up the pre-N router with the pre-N notebook card crashes the computer. The commonly labeled products are incompatible !!!!!.I would highly recommend to avoid this product and Belkin in general as a supplier if you need any assistance along the way.I am now planning to throw everything out and go with Linksys or DLINK.. Im just the end.. so frustrated..and on top of it all, people consider me a networking guru.."
68,"After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the ""antenna aiming signal strength indicator"" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit. If you already have XM at home, the signal sounds just as good with what you already have. With all the compression involved in beaming the XM signals to earth, there's only so much any device can extract. You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
69,"I wanted a frame capture unit that was firewire based and higher resolution to replace an older Pinnacle unit I bought many years ago. What was NOT disclosed on the Company A site by Adorama Camera was the return policy was 14 days from the time the unit was shipped. I live in a semi-rural area so I did not receive the unit until about 12 days after I bought it. By the time I hooked up the unit and tried to used it, I was already past the return policy. When I tried using it with Apple final Cut Pro, iMovie, and Adobe Premiere, the resolution was extremely poor. The unit was supposed to 720x480. So I captured the same video with the old Pinnacle unit (640x480) and the difference was markedly better. I concluded the unit was in fact only capturing 320x260. No matter what I tried it would get any better. My mistake was I thought I had 30 days to return the unit from the time I received it. As such I spent far too long trying to make it work correctly with no success. In the end, something happened with the unit and it completely disabled my firewire line. I had to remove it.When I tried to return it, then Adorama Camera informed it I was passed the 14 day return period. I tried getting a refund with Company A. No luck. It seems it didn't break in time for a return. So I am out $167.95. There is not even a warranty to exchange the unit for another one. Unless you want a piece of junk that is not good for a boat anchor, maybe a good paper weight do not waster your money."
70,So this DVI plug won't work in all DVI outlets.  Had no idea until after the packaging had been tossed
71,"I purchased this for my new Canon S3 IS.  Worked great the first time I used it (as a bounce flash).  I put it in my camera case, months later, I tried to use it again.  Would not work (piece of junk).  Company A nor Canon will take it back."
72,I have low line voltage in my century-old garage--95 volts was not enough for fluorescent lights.Hower this product only boosted 95 volts to 98 volts UNDER NO LOAD!  And it wouldn't power the fluorescents.  So it was useless for my purpose.Your voltage may differ.
73,"My GPS is an eXplorist XL.  I assume the guts are the same, so here goes.  I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am with this Magellan GPS.  I have been an exclusive Magellan user since 1999, but am now officially fed up.Customer Support:  Lack of.  Magellan simply has the worst possible record responding to requests for support.  When you call, after being on hold for hours, the person on the phone is clue free.  The Web site is inpentrable.  When you can't get on the site for any reason.  Or when you can't download something, there is no clue as to why.  By trial and error I have discoverd you have to turn off ANY firewall, and set your Explorer preferences to accept all cookies.New firmware upload.  It corrected nothing I cared about, and completely messed up the Geocaching Manager capability.  When I upload Geocaches the machine arbitrarily drops several ... but you have no idea beforehand which are dropped.Paperless system: With the memory card (I have 1GB, you should be able to store thousands of Geocaches and ALL the associated text.  Nope.  You get the name and a few items off the Geocache page.  Clues over a few words are truncated.The ""beeper"" is misleading.  It beeps whether you have done what you wanted or not.  Example:  I want to edit some coordinates on a marked fix.  I use the joy stick to move from number to number.  The GPS beeps whether the move was made or not.  The beep is independent of the desired result.  When you push the joystick you get a beep whether or not an edit was made. A ver annoying feature.When you do a Go To on a Point of Interest, you cannot see the icon on the compass page.  It is too small.  It needs to be White and larger.  Now it looks too much like the Sun icon.On a Go To the ""compass needle"" need to point to the destinaiton instead of North.  This option needs to at least be selectable.You need to be able to put yourself at the bottom of the screen so you can see more of what's coming up.  I don't care much about what's behind me...this needs to be a selectable option.Reliability:  A friend teaches GPS at the College level.  After 6 years with Magellan he recently moved to Garmin due to poor reliabiliity of the receivers.  His experience in large classes was a return rate nearing 40%Good things.  The XL is very rugged.  I have dropped it on rocks from ""too high"" and it has survived well.  The color screen is large and easy to read.Verdict:  Get something else."
74,did not work within a few days ....i think we should stick to apple for getting apple accesories instead of wasting money in cheap cables ...would not buy similar product again
75,Bought 2.  One broke after 15 minutes.  The other doesn't contact my neighbor 100 feet away.  Waste of lots of money.  Midland let me down.Motorola next.
76,"I don't like variable aperture lenses anyway, but I REALLY dislike this lens.  I thought it would be a super handy focal range to have available.  And it would be, except every image was blurry, even stopped down.  Had it sent in for repair.  Tamron said nothing was wrong, everything was within tolerances.  Yucky, yucky, yucky.  I'll never buy another Tamron lens again, junk.  Before you waste your money on this plastic lens (no glass in this one), make sure you have a quality Pentax lens to compare it against (yes even the Pentax 18-55 kit lens is better than this.).  I can guarantee you won't want it after a side by side comparison."
77,"I thought at first this was the ba-all-end-all of remotes - it controls lots of different devices, is easy to program via your laptop, the color LCD display which changes based on function, rechargeable batteries w/ cradle, remote turns on when you move it, backlit keys, etc.  But I can't recommend the 880 at all.The button design is very cool looking but very difficult to use in a darken room.  The volume up/down and channel up/down look nice in their curved placement but can't be easily found by your fingers in real life use.  Same is true for PLAY and PAUSE buttons; they don't stand out in any way for your fingers to find.  Also the ACTIVITIES button, which is used to switch functions on the LCD, is as flat as can be and hard to locate.  So what good is a remote if you can't find the volume UP/DOWN and PLAY/PAUSE easily in a darkened room?  The program via a PC concept that Logitech has created is super, but they really goofed on the 880 layout of the keys and they are back to using different designs on their other models.  Also, the battery charger/cradle is very unreliable on the 880 and we had to get a new one.  So the design goals for the 880 features/function was right on by Logitech, but the button design and execution make this specific model very disappointing."
78,"Avoid these. Bought a 10pak, and burned 3 coasters out of the gate.  Sold the remainder on eBay, and bought Verbatim DVD+RL (part 95166). These work 100% of the time (presently have burned about 100 with 0 coasters).As it was explained to me, Memorex buys their discs from other manufacturers. They don't make their own media.  Verbatim makes their own discs, and control the quality of every batch.  Memorex may get theirs from a number of manufacturers, each using different quality standards, thus giving you no guarantee between discs of whether they will work or not.  I've seen more then a few people say ""I bought 10 that worked great, then bought 10 more, and all those were junk"". No consistency at all.  BUYER BEWARE!"
79,"Mine died after one year.  Soon after getting it, I noticed I'd have to physically turn the switch in the back off then back on to get it to power up, then one day it just died while the computer was sitting there idle.  POS."
80,"I should have read the poor reviews. I wanted to go back to an older familiar keyboard, did a quick check on male/female and the color code and quickly hit click. This can't be complicated right? Quick, move on. Wait for adapter. Surprise! This won't work! They really should be clear in the description - IF YOU HAVE THIS ALREADY AND IT WORKS, HERE'S A ""REPLACEMENT"" LIKE IN THE TITLE. It won't work for anyone else as it lacks the smarts to actually convert a PS2 signal into a USB signal. It's just a physical plug for people who already had the smarts in their PCs (usually from factory) to do this. No drivers on the web either to get around this."
81,"I just brought a brand new ViewSonic LCD TV with built-in HD tunner.  It came with problems that the HD tunner has to change channel from high number to low number, or it will not show the TV program.  Say you want to watch channel 5, if you were at channel 4, move up to 5, the TV shows no program.  But if you move up to channel 7, then move down to 5, TV will show the program. It also often drop out the programs, while our other HDTVs made by Toshiba, Samsung, Screpter all working fine, this TV suddenly stop showing the TV progam and display ""no signal"".It is DOA, means it like this when we get it.I called ViewSonic for replacement.  They asked for my credit card number to setup an advance replacement.  I gave them my credit card number. But they shipped me a refurbished unit that was returned and repaired in the past.I paid a new TV price, ViewSonic wants me to accept their refurbished TV.  I called their support, and talked to their manager.  The manager told me that actually they had changed their policy again, since they shipped the refurbished TV to me.  They no longer send out replacement any more. When you have a DOA, they will only repair it now.I had experience with Viewsonic repair in the past. One LCD monitor we sent last year for repair took over four months came back.  Another Viewsonic HD12 HD tuner sent for repair got last, after six months, they sent me a replacement.  I am not sure I will buy another Viewsonic product any more."
82,"I've read all of the reviews here, and can agree with most of the complaints. My main problem the lack of Company J in graphics programs, it's difficult to control. I tried uninstalling Intellipoint and that improved the situation somewhat. The magnifier is indeed almost impossible to turn off. The most frustrating aspect is the vertical scrolling. Even at the slowest setting, images fly by too fast to see (in some graphics programs, ACDSee for example). Other mice have a click/stop with the wheel, this does not, and that may be the real problem."
83,"I bought this camera, the anti shake is good but the auto white balance sucks, i never realized the value of the feature until i got this camera. if you take flash pictures they came out fine but then if you switch to no flash they come out very yellow, and if non flash where good then the flashed photos came out very blue..."
84,"Plantronics has missed the boat with regard to the iPhone and new phones using a 3.5mm jack.This headset requires an adapter and there is your problem.There are different types of adapters (mono, stereo) that are very cheaply made that break or are not wired appropriately for mono headsets.  Those that are properly configured, such as Headset Buddy (look for the red ones),  are overly expensive and are often counterfeited being made with inferior components.Cellet, available on Company A, is offering a 3.5mm plug on its headset that does not require an adapter. ""Cellet 3.5mm Headset with Microphone Boom"".  Check it out before you buy this.It has a stereo plug (4 metal bands, 3 insulating rings) for plugging into a stereo jack such as the iphone and converting it  to a mono headset.  Cellet I think has this wired correctly to avoid  shorting right and left channels together.  Thus, it may make a better electrical connection than an adapter and provide a more reliable sound."
85,Worked for about twenty minutes was really under powered did not even feel like requesting a refund just not satisfied at all.
86,"!!!STAY AWAY!!! This will be my absolute last item I purchase from MONSTER for myself, for others as gifts and for any company I ever work for. I have purchsed lots of products from monster over the years including overpriced speaker wire, surge protectors and audio/video cables. I originally purchased the HTS 5100 Power Center around 2-3 years ago and all of a sudden one night it ""popped"" and never came back on. This seems to be a common issue after reading other reviews on this product on Company A and other electronic retailers sites. There was no power surge to the house or the this unit. I have other protectors that did not read any jolt in other outlets and nothing turned off/on in the house howeve the Monster HTS 5100 just died. This item is just not built to last, however it is priced like it should. I use less expensive Belkin and GE surge protectors/ line conditioners for years also and never had a problem with any of them or the equipment plugged into them EVER!!! I have only had problems with overpriced underperforming Monster equipment. You lost a customer Monster.No more Monster anything for me. YOUR FIRED MONSTER!"
87,"Don't know if there's much more to write.  The last D-Link Router I purchased, a DI-784, ran beautifully, with just a slight bit of help from tech support (I was a newbie).  This time, I spent 20 minutes going thru the typical overseas call center checklist, argued over the spelling of my name, the spelling of my email, unplug this, unplug that, restart this, restart that, being called ""Sir"" more than 3 times a minute.I consider tech support to be part of the product, especially from a company that makes huge claims about their support.  That, and the combination that this router was broken on arrival, means i'm looking for a new brand to buy."
88,"Cheezy as cheezy can be.  The only feature I liked was that this item could be returned!  The sound was terrible, not easy to tune, flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old.  This thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires.  Mine was promptly returned."
89,Mine is defective out of box. The only function of the Menu button is to turn it on. After I turn it on the Menu button no longer has any funtion when pressing it. The menu button is simply disabled after the unit is on. I could NOT get any menu on screen to browse for any more function other than viewing the current song. There is no way to use radio and recorder. There are two ways to turn it off: take out the battery or press Pause button and wait 1 minute. The Lock button works as expected and is not the cause of the problems I mentioned. I can load songs into it but can only play the songs one by one in the order and there is no shuffle play. SanDisk won't replace it becuase it's past the 1 year wanrannty period. I don't blame that they stick on their policy. But this is apparently a defective one that could not pass quality control at the first place let along being on market. No more SanDisk to me.
90,"The unit itself is fine.  The phone in customer support is another matter.  The automated customer service makes it excrutiatingly difficult to navigate towards the option of talking to a live rep, followed by a 30 minute wait once you are given the option to choose a live rep.  As I mentioned, the radio is good and no complaints, but the navigation and wait time for customer service leaves one questioning xact's degree of support of their product and customer."
91,"Don't be fooled by the ""Tripp Lite"" name.  The seller is sending you a much cheaper MonoPrice DVI-D Single Link Male to HDMI Female adapter, that sells for just $2.26 on their site.  Unfortunately, it isn't worth my time to return it, but I certainly got ripped off.  Thought I was paying a quality product by a premium manufacturer.  Instead I got this.  I could have bought a generic one on Company A, and saved myself at least half."
92,Waste of $4.  It will not charge my Palm T/X and not worth the time and trouble to send it back.
93,"This was supposed to be a Kingston but was a fake, instead of a colored plastic cover, it had colored paper wrappers. I sent it back for a refund."
94,"I haven't even bothered testing the audio quality of this microphone, because if I did, all I'd really be doing was learning what smacking into my desk sounds like. You see, that's all this microphone does: it falls down. The boom is not attached to the base tightly enough, and/or the detachable mic is too heavy. Either way, it won't stay standing. It just falls over. If it were plugged in, it would fall over and make an amplified thwack sound, instead of a light tap. So, yeah, that's why I don't deem any further testing necessary. I'm returning mine. Thank you, Company A, for making that so easy."
95,"amazing....they shipped a defective product to me - a patently defective product...one of the clasps was not attached - obviously missing. These things don't just fall off or break off. It was completely missing - the entire clasp/bracket on the right hand side. Very poor quality control at production and a careless packer who shipped a patently defective product.sad..............very lamePelican cases are better quality and you don't have this defective, missing, weak or easily broken clasp issue which crops up quite often with Otter boxes.bottom line: Go Pelican and avoid Otter box..."
96,"Unit I received would not charge my iPhone -- got the ""charging not permitted"" alert depicted in the user photos on this product page. Also would not charge my wife's LG cellphone.Totally worthless.  Have ordered &lt;http://www.Company A.com/gp/product/B003TULUJ8> to replace it.Opened unit up, and got strong ""burned electronics"" smell. Several bad-looking solder joints inside, as well as a resistor lead pushed over and contacting the shield of one of the USB connectors, effectively shorting the power to ground. Also appeared to be components missing from the internal PCB, but that could just be a configuration option, as in ""Oh, you want the configuration that actually WORKS?"" NOTE in subsequent investigation, I have determined that as delivered, even without the shorted resistor problem, this unit would NEVER work with an iPod/iPhone, because it doesn't provide the right voltages on the D+ and D- lines in the USB connector. I committed some surgery on it that made the iPhone happy (no more ""charging not permitted"" alerts), but it still won't actually charge the phone.I suspect that the shorted resistor wire has fried the unit. The LED still comes on, but it has no useful charging capability at all.Sorry zero stars is not available for this one."
97,"I ordered these cables for $8.49 with free shipping under Company A Prime.  They were sent by Super Deal.  They are not as pictured, as they have no tags and the gauge is smaller than those I purchased earlier.  While they may be serviceable, they are inferior to what I ordered and they are unacceptable to me.  As far as I'm concerned, this was not a mistake on the part of the vendor.  It is a misrepresentation.  I will accept a refund only, because I have no assurance that a replacement won't be exactly the same product I have already received."
98,"THIS IS NOT MY FIRST ENCLOSURE! ive done dozens of enclosures. but this one is plain junk! i hooked everything up flipped the switch,it worked for fifteen seconds till i turned it off then it never worked again! the connections are very poor,the AC connection wouldnt stay in. the workmanship cheap,not worth even a penny."
99,"Perhaps this product works well in remote areas, but in a location with a high concentration of radio stations (NY-Boston corridor) I was not able to play any mp3s without considerable static.  I tried continually to find sufficient gaps between stations but was never able to get the product to work at a satisfactory level and eventually gave up.  Waste of money."
100,"I ordered SKULLCANDY HEADPHONES.  I receied a baited and switched item, some kind of AMP'd headphones I never even heard of.  Do not buy these if you actually expect skullcandy.  I would expect Skullcandy will want to know what this seller with the help and assistance of Company A is doing to hurt its reputation and the lawyers will be waiting by the phone."
101,"This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod.  Same with cars.Wireless function is severely hampered.  You can get a song ""squirted"" to you only if the other person gives you permission.  Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.Why bother with the Zune?"
102,"This hub is low quality.  One broke after a month, and the replacement failed after a year.  It is non-functioning on a mac and a PC, and I tried the ""plug it into the wall fix"" that others have written about in reviews.  I've tried everything, and it's dead.  I'll buy a different brand as a replacement.  Low quality.  Buy a different hub."
103,"Why sell these if the service is shutdown?These were ok during it's time, but I had 2 of these devices that I ended up throwing away because service stopped a LONG time ago.  The second one was never opened, it was for my neighbor that did not use it before service stopped.1 Star for no service on a sold device that does not work anymore, sorry.  If someone took this over and started the service up again, please let me know and I will update my review."
104,"Save yourself hassle, time, and frustration.I stopped by Fry's electronics on my way home from work. I noticed at Fry's that there were scores of boxes of these units that were all refurbished. $29.99 I figured for the price it should provide basic functionality.Installed the software, plugged it in when prompted, and updated the drivers. Went on to a site with videochat and within 20 seconds the picture froze. It then crashed Firefox. When I force quit Firefox, I got a flash of what I assume is the infamous Blue Screen of Death. Just great. After reboot, Windows XP Pro told me it had recovered from a fatal system error and asked me to report the crash. I was up until near midnight trying to get this to work before I decided to return it and that I had done all I could to make it work (and also to write this review).I say that I assume it was the BSoD because I've never gotten a BSoD before. Even when I was teenager I did some dumb things to my computer (such as intentionally installing Back Orifice to learn how trojans worked). But now that I'm an adult and through a lifetime of learning, I am what is considered a Power User. I build my own computers, I run the best software and regularly maintain my pc, perform backups and restores, reformats, etc etc. I've never had a problem with malware, viruses, or serious operating system crashes because I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.In the course of trying to get this webcam to work, I saw FOUR BSoD's. FOUR.I'm fairly certain the driver is just not up to the job, and taking a look at the Creative Support page, I don't think it's been updated for awhile. Definitely buy a newer model, please. I was going to spring for the Logitech 9000 but I wanted something basic and lower cost for now.The last Creative product I bought was a Zen Vision:M 30 GB and that was also a waste. I guess the moral is to stay away from Creative in general."
105,"I wanted to love this lens, but at the end I had to give up.  My copy was very soft at f2.8.  If you normally shoot in good light (outside during the day), then you might have better luck with it because at f5.6 the sharpness is decent.  If you normally shoot in low light, then good luck.  You have two things against you, no VC (vibration control) and very soft wide open.  I've heard that the VC version of this lens is soft wide open as well, however, I've never tried it.  In September of 2012, I exchanged it for the Sigma 17-50mm f2.8 OS (I also had to pay the difference since the Sigma is a bit more expensive)and I never looked back.  I know that the price of the Tamron is very attractive but you'll get what you pay for.  The Sigma is about $200 more expensive, but it is far more superior than the Tamron, plus it come with OS.  The Sigma is so sharp it's unbelievable; you won't believe your eyes.  If you check videos on youtube of the Sigma 17-50mm, you'll notice quiet a few people complaining about how easy the lens hood falls off.  Well, it seems like Sigma has got their act together because they've been releasing some really amazing lenses lately with very good reviews.  The lens hood on my Sigma copy doesn't fall off at all.  That was probably a problem with early copies.Anyway, stay away from the Tamron 17-50; it sucks."
106,"Originally rated as 5-stars.This unit bricked after 17 months of use.Unsatisfactory...period.Two stars for the 17 months life span.Details from before it stopped working follow:The ever-increasing size of full resolution digital photographs have rapidly expanded my external storage requirements. This device replaced a 2 year-old 200 GB WD external drive that performed flawlessly (and was never powered off) for over two years.Obviously the test of a hard drive comes over time, and I've just started using this....but here's the ""out of the box"" experience:-Under a recent install of Windows XP SP2, it was immediately recognized by the OS and assigned a drive letter.-I copied the included utilities and backup software to my desktop, and did a full format from FAT32 to NTFS. This was to accommodate some video files greater than 4 GB in size.-After reformatting, I moved the included Google desktop, backup software and ""power button/capacity gauge LED"" back to the new WD HD.-The included backup software, EMC Retrospect HD v 2 is OK. I was already using a different program that I'm already familiar with [...] ""Second Copy 2000"", and that I think SC 2000 has a slightly better interface. But: the important thing is to use something!-The Premium edition's capacity gauge is cute, but of course your OS is going to tell you how much free space you have anyway...-The drive is very quiet, and I love that it powers off and on with the PC.WD has a good reputation for hard drives. Any vendor can sell you a lemon though.Works just fine off of a power strip too...100-day update (May 26)This drive handles various daily and weekly backups (full and differential) flawlessly. Excellent value for the price."
107,"The plug has a cheap plastic housing holding it together, and could not last past one charge and an over-eager 8 year old.  It did charge, but its not durable."
108,"i like to record tv shows and FF thru commercials. Unbelievably, this unit can't do that. I took it back immediately. (Most DVDs I like to FF occasionally.) A player that can't FF is like a car w/o accelerator, IMO."
109,"Be careful if you purchase this item for use with the Acer Aspire One- it will not work, and you void your warantee when you open the case to install it.I have communicated to Company A that it is not the correct RAM upgrad for the Acer Aspire- but for some reson they continue to list it as an item that people purchase with the AspireOne."
110,"I bought this and nearly ever time I switch computers, either my mouse or my keyboard stops working. The problem is apparently support for ""multifunction USB devices"" was left out of the product. To clarify: ""multifunction USB devices"" are things like a mouse with a scroll wheel or a keyboard with volume up/down buttons...the kind of thing that was shipped with every computer in the last 3-4 years.Even the rare time it did work, the switching process took a strangely long time. I am used to KVMs being ""snappy"" and being able to snap back and forth between computers. I would be tempted to race this thing against someone standing behind the desk swapping cables manually.The product was so poor I actually returned to swapping cables manually because it was easier than trying to fix the problem when the KVM failed to switch correctly (which was most of the time).All in all, it left me with a very dismal impression. It seems like, in an attempt to meet a consumer price point they missed the focus on the needs of the customer."
111,It worked OK for several months but then it smoked a few minutes after I plugged it in in a hotel room.
112,"I have to agree with several of the reviewers who found this remote to be ineffective in many ways.  I've had several universal learning remotes over the years, and this one was the most cumbersome to program by far. It failed to find any codes that worked completely properly, and all my equipment is new within the past 3 years.  I resorted to their learning method, but that didn't work at all.  Maybe I just got a lemon, but this remote was a waste of time and is being sent back today."
113,"Was happy initially for a month and then it stopped working all of a sudden.There is no company name or contact id or phone number or warranty!!!!I don't know what to do, whom to contact as no information is available.I tried googling it out but could not find any info."
114,"The product description said it is both Mac and PC compatible. The instructions that came with the unit said it was PC compatible only. It did not work with my Macbook Pro.  Also, the unit arrived with fingerprints on it and the packaging had been opened before."
115,I bought my first one a while ago and it died within the warrany period.  I worked with Netgear support and they sent me a new one.  Today I woke up and the second one has died.  The green power light comes on but nothing else.I will never buy another Netgear router.Gotta go.  Today is trash day and I want to make sure my $150 WNR854T gets into the trash today...
116,This product is not compatible with windows 7. It is not stated in the description. Nor is the customer service willing to help at all. That said it worked great for my laptop which runs on windows XP. I still wouldn't recommend this product because they have not stated which systems it is not compatible with. In my opinion this is false advertising.
117,"I've had this router for about 6 months, it worked fine for about the first two and then it started disconnecting for no known reason. I upgraded the firmware and it was smooth sailing for about a month and a half but now it is back to it's old tricks.I've done just about everything I can think of to make this thing functional, searched the web and D-Links site for solutions... but to no avail.I like the features and the look of the router it's self but I guess it is time to toss this one and move on."
118,"EnvironmentI have had 2 4 button Kensington mice since 1995. I have had 3 Optical elite 4 button since 2001. They all function well using the Mouseworks software. This mouse was purchased for a new Mac Pro 2.93 8-core system to be used in a 3D modeling, graphics environment along with other Macs that have the previous generation Optical Elite Kensington mice. I bought this mouse because I thought the Optical Elite is not available.Low light, Placed on corner station desktop, plenty of room.No games are on the system.Moderately low amount of text (typing).Heavy use for graphics, drawing and modeling. Average day use is around 10-14 hours.Physical6'2"" (186cm), Hand span pinky-thumb 10"" (25.4cm), medium-long fingers.OCD about hand cleanliness, wash 12+ times a dayci20 is larger than most. 5.125"" X 3"" X 1.71"". When you place your hand on it, the height being 1.71"" (vs. 1.5 Optical Elite) causes the wrist to have a bend in it. Very tiring and bad hand posture. You can use it with a gel wrist elevator pad but it is not practical since having 3 monitors to span, even with the accelerator function of software you find the pad to be too small. The surface is comfortable and the rubber grip area on Left and Right is very nice to hold on, alas, if your hand is very dry or if your have the smallest amount powder (if you just touched a piece of bread or a cracker) can make a very strange slippery feeling. The rubber grips have a honeycomb (Hexagonal) design that is 1/2mm deep. If your hands have anything on them it will stick and embed in the rubber making it dirty and sticky.The Left and Right button are very nice and conformable. The ci20 3rd and 4th buttons are both on the Left side and each is 17/32"" tall and not easy to put your thumbs on. I must add that I generally have my hand a little more towards the back to prevent my wrist hovering.The scroll wheel is rubber and looks like a car tire. Good grip on it and the button on it functions well. (Swap Scrolling direction)The Left and Right buttons chording (pressing both buttons at the same time) functions well.The 3rd and 4th button have a distance of 1/8"" between them which is a plastic bridge with a hump that makes the two button seamless. You really have to try and reposition your hand to chord the 3rd and 4th button! VERY DIFFICULT AND YOU WILL GET ONE OR THE OTHER!Also since they are both on one side the mouse starts to movie to the right a little and you have to try to hold it.The tech support for Kensington is in India/ Pakistan and very poor. After 15 minutes of talking with a TS and a supervisor he suggested ""put your hand in such way that the joint of your thumb is on the middle part and then you can easily press the two at the same time"".When I ask if that is the position he holds his hand on the mouse normally he says ""no. You have to reposition and carefully place your joint of thumb in the middle"".How is a chord button press is a shortcut  for a keystroke if I have to ""carefully"" reposition my hand instead of reaching to click a button?His response is ""This mouse was designed for a people with large hands!"" He also said he is able to do it very easily and comfortably. I asked for his height; he is 5' 4""Typically I use:Left Click, Double Click, Control+Click and Popup menu function with about 15 functions programmed in Mouseworks.Software:The Mouseworks software works great. You can assign many functions and macros to the buttons and streamline your work. You may even setup different sets for each button for each application. e.g. In most apps I use Left Click, Double Click, Control+Click and Popup menu function. The chord left and right buttons OPENs or COMMAND+O in Mac or same as Control+O (PC) and Chording the 3rd and 4th button performs a CLOSE; COMMAND+W or CONTROL+W. But in Safari and Firefox I use the front chord for BACK button of browser and the back chord to close a window. The newest version of it is 3.0 for Mac and it works with Mac OS X 10.4.11-10.6.2.There are a lot of adjustments for acceleration and deceleration of the mouse so you can really appreciate that if you have more than one monitor and have mover the mouse a lot to go from one end to other. Scrolling speed is adjustable, so is clicking speed. Unfortunately you can not chord the front and back buttons together. Basically this is a 7 button mouse while Kensington could have had the software to allow more combination for chording to make this to be 13 button mouse.Conclusion:This mouse is not very comfortable, it is too big unless you are  basketball player. The button placement design is a disaster. I returned this mouse and purchased the Optical Elite again which has the exact same functionality but the 3rd and 4th buttons are on left and right and chording them is simply squeezing the mouse in your hand! It is also only 1.5"" heigh so you do not have to bend your wrist much."
119,"I bought these headphones to try them out against my Sony in ear headphones, but I have to say that these barely cancel out 10% of the noise. My Sony headphones cancel at least 60% of the noise. I was hoping the other users were not able to activate the Noise Cancellation, or that the ""sweet spot"" the other users mentioned was easier to find, but this is not the case. These headphones really suck, and there is almost no Noise Cancellation at all. DO NOT BUY THESE. THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!"
120,"Maybe I have a defective example, but this mouse is NOT accurate. There is a frequent delay or hesitation when moving or clicking. I often have to click a second time because the first was not transmitted. Also, one of the stated benefits of a laser device is the ability to tolerate difficult surfaces. I often use this mouse on a level couch cushion and the pickup is spotty and intermittent. The same surface was perfectly fine for my older-style optical mouse.I will try returning this for another unit but I'm not holding out hope. It really seems like a half-baked product. (Lots of these available on ebaY as refurbs....hmmmm. I may be adding another one to the pile.)"
121,"I was looking for a VHS Tape Head cleaner that used the liquid solution to help clean an old VCR I have.  This item is not what they say it is. It does NOT come with any liquid, nor does it even look like the picture.  I had to return it, so beware."

123,"I would rate this drive a ""four star"" rating but I can't change it from the ""one star"" I gave it earlier.  It's a good drive but there are some faults with it.  First, it's rather unattractive.  It's covered in a sickly greenish translucent plastic.  Actually, this is probably very attractive to Apple computer users.  They like this weird look.  But Windows users like me would find it a little strange.  Second, the button at the front has a very bright white light surrounding it which is a little too bright for me.  Third, if you install the drive on a Windows Vista machine it won't work.  Period.  If you go to their website it doesn't give you much help in figuring out what's wrong.  I finally got it to work with Vista by downloading updated software from Maxtor's website.  The installation instructions for this software doesn't match what actually happens when you install it so you have to do your best trying to figure out how to install the updated software.  After installing it my Vista machine froze up even after two reboots.  But after the third reboot it finally worked properly.  Now the drive is installed, the computer sees it, and the settings are set.  Hopefully the backups will work properly."
124,"This is either a great product or a bad idea.  I bought me a 22 inch Samsung TV and tried to hook this antenna to it. I received only 3 channels out of the 25 local HD Channels I get in the area.Of course I was not expecting much but to readjust the antenna all the time just to get the channel you want is not worth it.  I know i get over 25 channels since I also own a Terk FDTV1A combine with a Motorola Signal Booster BDA-S1 and it does miracles even in a room that is built of bricks and having big metal trucks outside of room (note: main reason why the little rca rabbit ears are bad idea for my environment.)If you take the RCA basic outdoors with your tv or if you live on a second story than i would say this is ok, but if you are like me, bind by brick construction and too much obstruction from big trucks and solid metal objects, this antenna is not for y ou..."

126,"Ok, I have had this pair of headphones for 2+ years.  I have to disagree with some people saying the build quality is horrible.  I havent had any problem with the headphones in that department.  The only thing I replaced on it were the ear cushions.  But i think the reason people buy this headphones is because ""it sounds so nice.""  I was in the same boat and got suckered into buying this at the Bose store [...]  Boy was I stupid.  I bought another pair of sony dj monitor headphones (MDR-V700DJ) for my turntables and i found that the sony sounds WAY better than the bose and it is half the price.  The sony has better bass, way better mids (bose doesnt have any) and good highs.  I would not buy this pair of headphones for any reason or recommend anybody else to buy it.  I would strongly recommend you to buy a good pair of sony."
127,"This drive failed on me at a critical moment in the field. I had only owned it for 6 months, and it was not used very intensively. It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged.During a photo shoot, I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport. The drive simply would not work. It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it. After trying to get it working, it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead.I'd hate to think that being jostled in my bag was enough to cause this drive to fail. If that's the case, then it has serious durability issues."
128,"I installed one of these cables between my gigabit ethernet switch and my Canon Pixma 6700 color printer.  I know it's not a sanctioned use, but I was looking for the ultimate in speed and color fidelity.

As soon as I opened the box I new I had a superior product. It's made of a heavier plastic and seems much more durable. Yes, I drive a truck and the suspension is a little harder, but I'm rarely off-road and, like I said, it was just an average pothole.

I have a total of 5 coax cables coming out of the damn thing, no small cables or internal jumpers, NOOO!! 5 full size coax RG-6 cables just there, plus the power cord.After maybe 90 days of use the DVR just go bad, the Tv1 light is on and off and no signal comes out of the machine no more... maybe the extreme heat, and the cheap fans that sound like are coming apart are the root of the problem, I dont know but now I cant watch tv until maybe two more days when Dish send a new unit (I hope no a 625!!)."
137,"I got this radio for my birthday in August 2007.  It worked great for two months, then the antenna jack failed and I had to sent it back for a replacement.  The replacemet lasted for a week before the same problem occurred.  The second replacement came broken- it was a refurbished radio (I had originally bought a new one, call me crazy but I think that when a new product breaks under warranty it should be replaced with a new product) with more than 200 songs already loaded, not that I could listen to any of them because as I said, it came broken.  My third replacement was also a refurbished radio, with ten songs loaded on to it, it never picked up a signal.Now it's February, 2008.  This time I called American Express, and was told to send the whole thing back and they would arrange a refund.  I did, and two days later I got an angry call from Delphi- they want to know why I didn't go through ""proper procedures"" and ""give them a chance to honor the warranty.""  I told them that I had no interest in getting replacement radios until the warranty expired and would NEVER do business with Delphi ever again.Oh, besides the constant breaking down, all of the negative comments already here are spot on- the screen freezes, the buttons are unresponsive, the unit hates the cold (I like to take walks, if it's under forty degrees this unit will NOT function properly) you get a constant ""No Signal"" or ""Check Antenna"" signal (check it for WHAT?  I think Delphi wants you to jam the thing into the unit till it breaks,) etc. etc.Avoid this unit, and you'll avoid big-time headaches and frustration.I ordered the Samsung Helix yesterday- my niece got one for Christmas 2006 and hasn't had one issue with it as yet.

140,I've owned several sets of ear buds from Sony and have been very satisfied with them.  These aren't real Sony ear buds.  Horrible sound.  The cord comes in 2 sections.  If you want to hold your audio device 6 inches from your head then you can use these as the connector will fit in a standard audio jack.  But if you want to add the extension cord forget it.  The connector is too small for a standard audio jack.  What a joke.  Junk.I am done buying from Company A merchants.  2 out of 3 purchases are problems.  Thank goodness Company A will step in and resolve problems because these merchants won't do anything unless pushed.

If I inserted the card into my camera or music device, the device displayed a warning that the card was bad.  I contacted 'marketplace' seller CTCStore, and they told me to return the card, at my expense and they would evaluate it.  Then it occurred to me to try to use a camera to re-format the card.  This appeared to work, so I tried one more time to get my computer to accept the card.  This time there was no problem.So I wonder was the new card unformatted or did it contain some garbage piece of software?Why would a memory card be delivered in an unformatted condition?Why was this not mentioned in the limited documentation with the SD card?Should a new memory card be delivered in a condition that will crash my computer?BEWARE of Transcend SD."
142,"The quality of the image es bad, too pixelate, and after the 5th use  the cradle breack apart and.... the notice....!!! this product only has 90 days  of warranty!!!!... for the same price I will get the philips DCP850, and also I can view DVD movies on it."
143,Everything was great until it started losing channels.  I would be watching a program and the channel would just disappear.  The only way to get the channel back was to do a full scan and it would only last for 15 minutes or so before it would disappear again. Nice product if it was reliable.
144,"I normally don't write reviews, but I'm doing this one mainly because I want to lower the 3.5 star (average) that it currently has, so then maybe one chap won't get ripped off. It does the same thing as cheap cables, at 60x the price. The ugly copper/white/black color design is not worth the $197 premium that you're paying. Actually, I'd rather get regular black colored HDMI cable, even if both were priced the same."
145,"Got this and both my husband and myself were severely disappointed.Sound quality is great.Yet unless you are right on the clock you cannot see the time on the front display (the projection works...if it is night time or dark in your room)I owned it for 3 months and never set the alarm on it short of a couple of times. Very difficult to set and change, plus turning it off is a pain and a half. I finally settles on a iHome with dual alarms...My husband and I are much happier now.Don't waste your money on this.We got it at a major discount and we couldn't wait to get something else that was more expensive.Never used the nature sounds since the rest of it was so hard to work.OH...both my husband and I are geeks, so it was due to bad design that we didn't set the alarms too often. Not due to us, we can admit when we are idiots. ;-)"
146,"I'll try to be brief....I agree with most of the other negative reviews..here's why:1. Right off the bat, none of the three sizes fit snugly or securely in my ear....they kept slipping around every time I moved.  Needless to say, they really didn't keep out even the smallest noises outside. No matter how I positioned the plugs, they never felt comfortable.  When I called Bose, they said sorry, but they only provided three sizes of plugs.2. The sound volume itself was very low compared to all my other headphones.  Maybe it's because the power is used to provide extra clarity etc......I have no idea, but again, I could hear everything (including normal conversations) going on around me even at the loudest volume.3.  For $100 a pair, I really expected more.  I returned these after three days of trying to use them."
147,"This is a &#34;Discwasher&#34; made by an idiot tasked with replicating the original Discwasher, someone who couldn't make toast if they had it done for them.The cloth is poorly attached with lumpy creases and folds, and isn't made of the original material with the aligned fibers that actually remove dust. Instead, it's just fuzzy cloth that creates fluff that sticks to your records! Also, there's no storage chamber in the center of the handle to store the bottle of fluid (which is really just distilled water with a minute drop of detergent in it).Go on eBay and buy an old one for $10-$20."
148,"This product did not mount properly and therefor did not function, and had to be returned.This product did not mount properly and therefor did not function, and had to be returned."
149,"This GPS has no free range navigation. In other words, you can't just turn it on and see where you are and your speed. You have to give it a destination first. That's just plain dumb. Avoid at all costs."
150,"I bought this unit with the name ""XTRASTOR"" on the cover.  It is the exact same unit and it doesn't read any of my CF, xD, or SD cards.Save your money and steer away from this piece of junk."
151,"I ordered this item a couple of years ago. I always keep it in my car. The problem I found with this unit is that  plastic part is attached to the base with 4 screws. These screws loose and may drop on any cavity in your car. These tiny screws are hard to find if dropped. I ended with just two screws. Later these two screws will just detach from the plastic (there is a tiny brass female screw that joins the plastic with the male screw, and these brass pieces just get loose and fall). So the whole assembly is very hard to fix by just tightening the screws. At the end the flat surface of the plastic holder will also crack. See picture posted.Few days ago I decided to purchase another item to replace the bad one.If you shop for this item in a retail store (say Best Buy), the item will just like the pictures shown on Company A.com. A sealed plastic package and marked Made in Taiwan. But, when ordered from Company A, you end getting the item in a carton box,  and marked Made in China, packaged in Taiwan.After receiving the item and noticing that the item was not according to the description I requested a return to Company A, and also explained the difference. Company A solved the issue and sent a very similar item, but this time the item was marked made in Taiwan.I hope this one does not have the same issues as the bad one made in China. The new one seems to have a better more professional assembled look. The material on the bottom seems to be of better quality too, but the screws look very similar to the Chinese version. What I hope is that this time it last longer, with no loose screws.But if I have to buy it again I will just purchase it at Best Buy and ask for price match with the Company A.com price. That is the best bet, to avoid any issues with the description on Company A's website."
152,"It had to be cut down to fit. It's maintained it's functionality for a year but I can't help but think I could've gotten a better screen protector for less, that would've fit my MBP screen without me having to cut it down."
153,"Buyer beware...I just bought one of these Sony NP-FH70 batteries from ""estoredirect"" here on Company A, and it's a counterfeit. It used to be that the fakes were mostly confined to ""the bay"" auction site, but now they are flooding Company A as well. Please see my attached photos of the actual fake I received next to the Company A product information. I will be reporting this to Company A as well, of course.The question is, how do you tell if the battery your purchased is real, or a cheap knockoff? To be sure, the packaging looks authentic enough, if not quite as professionally printed as the real thing. You have to look closely to see the details that show it's a fake. First of all, the battery itself should have a white circle with blue in the middle that has the words ""Recycle"" and the number 1-800-822-8837. The fake lacks this logo and number (see photo). Also, the wording of the back of the package itself contains misspellings. See the photo of the back of the package showing the word ""accuracy"" misspelled as ""accurccy"". Further, the printing on the back label is a bit fuzzy, not clear like on the package of a genuine Sony battery.I have not yet opened the package, in the past I've noticed that fake batteries also have a very poor fit and finish (in addition to being a fire hazard...see Nikon's website for example of fake Nikon batteries that have exploded and caused fires). Once I open it, I will update this review to add any further details about the fake battery.These are more than just fake batteries; they are cheap, dangerous imitations that will not perform properly, may damage your equipment, and could even cause personal injury or worse."
154,"After having this camera for 3 weeks and taking it on a trip to Hawaii, I must say it is a poor choice for a camera. My main complaints:1) Too much Noise Reduction over ISO 100 setting. What this means in layman's terms is that pictures look ""blurry"" or ""soft pixelated"".2) The lens gets dirty easily due to the swing open little plastic doors.3) Pictures are TOO DARK and skew BLUE.4) The size is large, it's heavy.At the end of the day, I would go with a Canon. They have much better color quality and are reasonably priced. You will miss the 10X zoom and wide angle though... that is the main reason I bought this camera in the first place.It's en-route back to Company A as we speak."
155,If you are a masichist this is your machine. Mine's been to the repair depot twice and now I read all the reviews and see that ALL the flaws in this piece of junk are STANDARD. Call Toshiba and tell them what I did.They needed to lose the format war to maybe snap them into respecting their customers.
156,It took a while to get here and the cd doesn't work and the sound card worked on and off for an hour before stopping. This was truly a waste of money.
157,"I bought this camera as the price was low and the brand was Nikon. I also bought the memory that showed up in Company A as ""items other people bought"" when they bought this camera. The camera takes about 5 seconds to save the image to the memory. Thats so long that all the next photo gets messed up. As the camera was bought to ""point and shoot"" and if it takes so long to ""point and shoot"" then hey, it no good for me. I intend to return it as soon as I reach home, later this week."
158,"Had mine for a few weeks.  Seemed ok.  Saved 8gb worth of stuff for a clean install.  Plugged it in after clean install.  Did not work!!!  Won't come on, can not retrieve saved files, they are gone.  PNY???  Too bad, so sad.  Offered to replace,  but too bad for me on lost files.  Be careful!!!  Had it checked for damage...no damaged solder, no broken connections.  Just stopped working."
159,I have the same problem...I got it to use with my JVC car stereo but after a few minutes it seems to lock up. I did a full format and tried again but same thing happens. Useless...
160,"I had this Samsung for 10 days and the power source went out on it. Called Samsung, told me to contact local tech, they in turn said it would be 10 days til they would get to me and then they would have to order the part and would take several more days. I wasn't going to except this so I contacted Company A and they sent me a new one in exchange (kudos to Company A in there customer service dept.). I had this TV for 30 days and went to turn it on, and guess what, the exact same thing happened to this as the first one, the power source wnet out on this one too. Totally pissed off at this point I contacted Company A and notified them again. Mind you, I'm not PO'd at Company A, just Samsung. I'm returning this SECOND set and getting my money back and going with the Panasonic instead which I should have bought all along. For the exact same thing to happen to both of these TV's is not a fluke, it's a problem with the units. Yes I had these sets plugged into the best surge protectors on the market, and it isn't user ignorance, these sets our junk. I thought with the first one it might have been just a lemon so I didn't write about it, but enough is enough!! Samsung take a hike hello Panny!!! **Update - 10/27/07*** I've had the Panasonic THP50X77U for about 45 days now, and if you want a GREAT plasma for $1600, then this is the one. I won't do a review here on this TV since this is for Samsung. Just beware when purchasing a Samsung."
161,"Do not buy this junk.  Dos  not work. As far as i can tell, none of the wireless motion sensors  work well. I have tried other brands as well.  Either they dont work at all or the oppisite happens.  They are to sens  this results in constant false allarms. No good etheir way.The only motion detecters is find that work well are the standard  120 volt motion detecters you see on flood lights,ect."
162,"I purchased an RCA (Thompson... ugh..) 8320 and it completely died within the warranty period. I returned it and RCA shipped me the 8335. I've been using it for under a month and I've already had to unplug it and plug it back in 4 or 5 times when it froze trying to read a DVD or VCD. It also gives me ""No Signal"" messages while recording cable TV programs but the signal strength is fine when I look at the cable modem status screen. The MAIN thing that I hate about it is I have to reset the clock every time it loses power... which means I would lose ALL programming to record future shows if there was a power failure. This alone could send me into the ""Postal"" mode should a badly wanted movie be missed. My advice?... STAY AWAY FROM THOMPSON RCA!!!!  This isn't my first encounter with them.... but I hope it will be my last. The RCA logo fooled me this time... Had I realized it was Thompson I wouldn't have bought it to start with..."
163,"I bought one of these Kodak's the other day because I have owned three Kodak digital cameras and I like the Kodak interface.  The fact is that this camera takes excellent pictures, but it eats batteries so fast (so UNBELIEVABLY fast) that I have to give it one star.  I am using AA rechargeables and I am lucky if the batteries last two days or over 20 pictures.  It really is that bad.  Forget about movie mode or using the LCD screen.  I've never had a camera die on me so many times, and I've only had this camera about two weeks."
164,"This case failed in under four months of daily use. It turns out the case is the thinnest, crappiest, veneer of leather over cardboard. The belt loop ripped out of the back, ripping the cardboard. Nasty crummy construction and I can't even find the made in China tag.Very poor for a Canon accessory.Previously I have used the real leather Canon cases and they have lasted years of being on my belt every day.Some people complain about storage. What storage? What do you think you are going to need? I charged the battery and used the camera for weeks before the low battery warning, I took hundreds of shots. With a 4Gb card you can take pictures all day, even videos, and not run out of memory. You don't need to take anything with you so long as the battery is charged and you paid the few extra bucks for a decent sized memory card."
165,"My poor elderly mother! Her Sony DVD/VCR died not too long ago, and she went out to buy another DVD/VCR recorder/player, only to keep bringing home ones that did not have TV tuners, and needed a cable box. By the time she bought home this jewel, she decided to just get a cable box. Cox set the whole thing up, so it was set up right. And I set the timed programs, so I know those were right.But soon my mother started complaining the VCR would only tape a part of her soaps on ABC, and then the screen would go white. Since she is sometimes VCR challenged, I assumed she was doing something wrong.  I told her right out it had to be her! She said she was taking this recorder back, and I once again told her there was nothing wrong with it--it was her! Then, I started reading reviews online about this recorder...oops, it wasn't her! This Sony recorder does not record right with a cable box.  When my mother took it back to the store where she got it, the clerk didn't even look in the box to see if everything was there. And no restocking fee was charged. The clerk simply took the box and said: ""Yes, people keep bringing these back."""
166,"I bought this laptop cooling pad on 7/20/09.  Initially it worked fine, aside from the fan being a little small for my liking.  Today (7/24/09) when I took the pad out of my laptop bag to set up for the day, I noticed that the connector on the back of the pad (where you connect the USB cord) had fallen back inside the pad.  This pad has not been treated roughly - it hasn't ever been outside the house! Completely shoddy build and  a rather epic design flaw! I know I'm not alone with this problem - there are several other reviews that note this same thing happening to them.I won't be rushing to purchase anything else by Belkin in a hurry. If I could give it no stars, I would.  This laptop cooling pad is a piece of utter junk and I urge other Company A customers to avoid it like the plague!If you want a decent cooling pad, I'd recommend paying the extra $ and getting a solid one from a manufacturer such as Antec. (My mom has a cooling pad by Antec and has never had a problem with it)."
167,"The appliance comes with evil, unwanted, non-uninstallable software. Here is what it does:1. Installs itself on your system without asking your permission first. It puts an icon in your tray. It pops up a window suggesting more software you can get.2. It claims you can unstall the adware, but the uninstaller does not work. If you delete all the files, they magically reappear every time you put the device in the port. (This is a SPYWARE technique, and it is EVIL.)3. An uninstaller downloaded from the SanDisk web site similarly does not work. Perhaps it works on some systems, but it did not work on mine.4. It accesses the internet. My firewall stopped it, but the question is, WHY would any flash drive try to access the web? I have confidential data. I do NOT want my flash drive giving ANY information to any other source. Again, this is a typical spyware activity.5. No privacy statement. No license agreement. No documenation warning you that unwanted software will be installed. No information about the installation, such as what registry keys were added, or where hidden files reside. I could be carrying artifacts of this device on my system for years, and I wouldn't even know it.Although I can not technically call this software spyware, I can call it frustrating, aggravating, and EVIL. It wasted my time not only researching this nasty behavior and how to clean up my system after this appliance touched it, but also the time it takes to return this evil device to the vendor."
168,"If it fits great, it will do the job.  But the advertising on Company A cleary says "".... Rubberized lens hood stretches to fit lenses from 48mm up to 77mm filter size....""  Hogwash!  It fits 52 to maybe 58mm.  I could not get this thing on a canon 77mm filter size lens with a pry bar.  It falls off a 48mm filter and if you push it back onto the len itself it covers the guage reading distance.  Save your $$$"
169,"I ordered this item against my better judgement considering all the negative reviews. Unfortunately, my faith was not rewarded. The unit I received would not hold a charge, so I returned it. I thought about playing the return for replacement lottery until I got a working unit, but decided poor initial quality had a high likelihood of translating into poor lifetime quality. Sad, this looks great in concept."
170,"SENT IT BACK.  ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU READ ABOUT WITH ONKYO CAME TRUE AFTER 3 WEEKS.  GO WITH A YAMAHA.  ONKYO MAY INCLUDE A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY CUT A LOT OF CORNERS.  IS THERE A ""ZERO"" STAR?"
171,"I have previously owned a portable Audivox DVD player for my car, which gave me all sorts of problems and Audiovox stopped supporting after only 3 years (in other words, they wouldn't repair at any price).  Thus, I entered into this purchase with hesitation.  However, I wanted an under-the-cabinet small screen TV, and there are only a few options in this market sector.I should have learned, but same as my last Audiovox purchase, this one was problem-laden.  While it worked (all of 6 weeks) it was adequate.  Decent picture, average sound (I didn't expect more for the size and price), and installation was fairly easy.However, about 5 weeks into ownership, the screen went black.  No warning, no power.  It happened once, and I thought perhaps a fluke event.  However a week or so later it went black again, same thing, no power, no picture. And it never came on again.I've called Audiovox again, and again their service has been non-existent.  They actually recommend ""buying a new one"" and told me they ""can't always get parts for these"".It makes me think they don't actually make any products but pay someone else to make items for them.I wish I had just tried the more-expensive Sony.PROS:* Decent video quality* Screen can be turned 270 degrees* Remote is user-friendly* Includes radio; decent sound.CONS:* Audiovox products seem prone to failure and Audiovox doesn't stand behind them.  Warranty is virtually worthless"
172,"This is the first Sony product that i just absolutely hated. I'll start out by saying I'm far from a audiophile but i know what quality speakers sound like and its not this. Granted its a $50 dollar set of Wireless headphones so I'm not expecting the world but man are these terrible. First off if you have the headset on without having something playing it sounds like your old school cable crapped out and you are getting blasted by white noise from your tv. Second the volume gets loud and soft quite often and its not because of a low battery(first charge was for close to 36 hours) and not because of the range(I am no more then 10 feet away). Third thing is that they feel very cheap and by cheap i mean very flimsy and plastic(feels like a cheap toy your kid would brake in 2 second). God forbid you fall asleep with these on or drop them from your bed or sofa. AND Last and more importantly the sound was terrible. At about medium headset volume the bass and highs sound like they were playing from the blown speaker in my 98 corolla.Thought i would roll the dice since the reviews were some where around 50/50 but i hope future buyers read this and save the time it takes for Company A to ship you this and for you to ship it back for a refund.Would give no stars if that was an option. I was use to a certain quality from Sony and this is not it.Maybe i just got a dud, but from most of the other reviews i may not be the only one."
173,"Used it to calibrate three different monitors - an old 16"" Eizo LCD, a Midnight laptop, and a Compaq laptop, and all came out looking the same shade of magenta. Just didn't work and had to return it."
174,I ordered these for my computer. They are for an amplifier not computer. Some day I may find a use for them but right now they are no better than junk to me.
175,"Doesnt even work.  Drive by cops all the time and it never goes off.  While some may not have radar on at the time i pass, at least a few must and I mean it NEVER goes off.  Unless I go near the schools in town (must pick up their security systems or something).  I don't even bother plugging this in anymore."
176,"Just don't buy this, the internal hard disks are VERY noisy... and they die after 36 months.  Save your money and buy ANYTHING else."
177,"The sound this speaker intentionally provides is quite good; but as soon as the power cord is connected to an AC source, there's an audible buzz, which can be heard anywhere in the room and is present as long as the power is connected.  It was unacceptable and I returned it."
178,"I really wanted to write ANYTHING good about this set, but starting from weight,  then - extremely uncomfortable fit, muffled sound and last, but not least - buzzing microphone -I understand it is a CHEAP item, but it still does not have to be junk..."
179,"do not buy this.  all it does is keep the heat off your lap and is a raised platform for when placing on your bed, or something."
180,"I bought this device to clone my wife's C drive hard disk on her Fuji N6410 notebook computer, which uses a standard 2.5"" SATA hard drive. Well, the hard disk would not fit into the CMS Transfer Device. The manufacture gave no information about which drives would and would not fit in their device. Well, I needed the drive backed up so I did so without using the metal containment case. The backup time was very slow and at least one system file was left out. I had to replace the file from the original windows disk. I would not buy from this manufacture again. I since have bought another backup device and am using more reliable software which clones on startup instead of trying to do it through windows, so no files are left out. Be careful in buying transfer kits. I am an Company A Prime Buyer and have been buying stuff almost exclusively from Company A for many years. This is the first problem I have ever had with a purchase."
181,I just bought one of these in the hope that it might be better than some of the reviews said but I was disappointed.  The picture is not accurate as it has a combo US blade and Euro pin recepticle.The main problem with this is that the US blade prongs do not fit tightly and easily fall out. Because they are so loose they do not make good electrical contact and can easily overheat and burn out.I took it apart to see if it just needed adjustment and the spring contacts are for a pin prong not a blade.  It you are using a euro pin plug it might work but it will not grip and hold a US flat blade.Even if you use a 3 prong grounded plug in it to stabilize it the blades will not connect securely and will make a partial high resistance connection which can result in it melting and causing a fire.Do not buy!
182,"I bought this for my Canon 28 to 135, trying to save a few bucks from the over priced Canon hood. It took a while for me to even get it started, when it finally caught it was so hard to rotate it around I though I was going to break the lens . I put it back in the box and returned it"
183,"This keyboard freezes pretty regularly.  It'll drop keystrokes and then it will add in duplicates of other.  I've tried it on other computers in the house and it's hit or miss.  It'll work great for a few minutes and then it'll start dropping keystrokes or freeze alltogether. I've had other MS keyboards that are great, but this is the worst ever!It is comfortable and it's soft on the wrists, but the fact that it just plain doesn't work makes it worthy of ZERO stars.  Too bad that's not an option!"
184,"It should be noted that replacing the battery voids your warranty, but chances are, if you're buying it now, the warranty has long expired. It should be also noted that replacing your iPod nano (1st gen) battery does require soldering skills. I suggest you practice before proceeding.I was hoping to squeeze out a few more months out of my nano, but I guess that was wishful thinking. This battery is quite low-quality. When I installed it into my iPod nano, it got extremely hot. I double checked the wiring, so I was sure that I had installed it correctly. I doubt it even charged.It's a low-cost repair, but your results may vary."
185,"I don't understand it, but I was able to use this one time when I first purchased it.  HOWEVER, I could not use it in my computer to sync or charge today.  When I plugged it into my computer USB port a message popped up and stated that there was a power surge in the port.  I tried it three times in three different USB ports and finally gave up.  I was able to reset the ports so I can still use the ports.  Apparently the little blue adapter isn't proper for my Midnight XP Company B 6400 laptop now. I can't say if a newer computer or laptop would accept it.  Why the 1 star?  I was able to use it one time."
186,"There isn't much to say about this product considering it doesn't work. I got mine, plugged it in, and it hasn't done anything. What can you expect from something that's $1.18."
187,"Where do I start. This product is a discontinued model. It doesn't tell you that anywhere. I'm using a Midnight Company I 1510. Windows XP (Any newer OS has 0 support with this item. I read this and heard it direct from a Creative Labs technician.) I'm also using this with a set of Wireless Sennheiser RS120's. (I assure you anything you are about to read is not a reception issue as I can tell the difference and am only feet from the receiver.)This is my experience before during and after my purchase. I have on-board sound and while it was fine for some time and definitely at least worked for videos and movies etc, it left a lot to be desired. Here is an explanation of my default sound setup in the 1510:""Audio:The speaker quality was on par with notebooks of this size and price range. The stereo speakers on the 1510 are located on either side of the keyboard and produces relatively shallow sound with limited range and no bass. You can get the volume loud without much distortion, but the audio coming out of these tiny speakers is less than impressive.This is unfortunate because many 12"" and smaller notebooks (such as the HP tx2000z or HP 2133 Mini-Note) have stereo speakers that produce high quality sound with excellent range of highs, middles, and lows. The Company I 1510 is a budget business notebook, but I'm certain that Midnight can do better than this.On the bright side, both speakers are positioned perfectly for directing sound up and towards the user. Also, the headphone out port delivered crystal clear audio to my headphones during the test period.""Now as with all laptops, if you haven't ordered a high quality sound and graphic card pre-installed you are stuck with it for the life of the laptop. There just aren't any satisfactory solutions out there to compete with a quality PCI card or pre-installed card. PCMCIA cards, ExpressCard's, and USB all suffer from the same bottle neck transfer issue and are just not suited to properly power music. I was playing both .mp3 and .flac and it's just garbage all around. I really wanted this to work but it didn't and I am too honest to fool myself into thinking it made a satisfactory difference. I feel like I wasted my money and needless to say I will be returning it 1 day after ownership. I only wish to save everyone else the experience of being disappointed as well. This will not solve your problem despite what the inaccurate or over enthusiastic reviews tell you. Most are just ""Views"" not Re-Views.To sum it up, I plugged the card in, Windows detected it, installed automatically after a medium size download of around 50mb maybe. Plugged my headset in and still no difference over stock. Used CD and installed everything on it then rebooted. Still crap. Updated all software in another huge download using their auto-update which also updated the drivers. Rebooted. Minor improvement, still insignificant and highly lacking in performance. It's as if it just made the garbage sound I already had ""smell"" better. Some songs I can turn up higher but others I have to turn back down. There is even a noticeable buzzing sound now that you hear when a speaker goes bad that sounds like it is loose or broken. The bass is horrific in that it is lacking in impact totally and also just sounds bad. EQ and EFX* Bass Boost and 3D Surround Features? Forget about it. Useless when it just sounds bad to begin with.*There is a hissing that you hear when a track goes silent and is sometimes noticeable when the track is playing that I was hoping this would cure. I did experience it on my on board sound and a CD Player too so I don't blame it for that, it could be the headphones there. I do know they work because at least on the CD Player I could turn up the volume all the way and hear it clearly despite lacking in bass as well.Pros:-Fit into my expresscard slot with a little room to spare.. I guess this could be a con since it isn't flush but i'm just glad it fit right.-Installation while time consuming and required large file downloads (100-150mb) was flawless. I ended up uninstalling the wave software and Mediasource package as it seemed worthless enough.-Item came neatly packed and with seemingly all new products and packaging all factory sealed. (Ordered the refurbished one since I knew this item wasn't even worth $30 after reading the reviews and talking to tech support before I got it.)Cons:-Audio improvement was marginal if not worse.--Complimentary Earphones that came with item has a label that reads the following:""California Proposition 65 Statement - WARNING: Handling this product may expose you to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.""Now that's just ****'*** nuts. As a reviewer at the egg site put it, how about a non-mutagenic product please?The earphones do look cool, but I refuse to even touch them to find out and I was busy looking at them through the clear packaging. I mean you'd think when a company knows they are using dangerous materials/chemicals they would recall it completely. Not Creative Labs! They conveniently make use of the resources to save every penny with no regard for their customers whatsoever.As another reviewer said here, Creative is just an all around lousy company. I used to enjoy their PCI sound cards a few years ago and didn't have many gripes about it but really this company isn't just bad, they have gotten worse with time over the years. The only thing they are ""Creative"" about is their ability to create an endless array of problematic or sub-par products with built in planned obsolescence. I mean even the techs admitted that this product was better than the newer black one. They purposely make the items worse and then better to give you a reason to come back. This is a horrible business philosophy and permanently turns people off to your products. The tech also revealed that all Creative product are discontinued every 3 years. Support for their products is hell. Just try calling them. Right now go try to call them. I bet you can't. Everything tries to direct you back to email. Using a new Contact directory website I found using the popular G search engine I was able to find a working number in the comments there after failing to get through their Extremely irritating broken prompts in the 2 main numbers listed.I wrote this review out of an unbiased honest experience. I have no interest in wasting my time writing this just to ""flame"". I have better things to do really and I hope if enough people speak up about this company they might get their act together. By the way you only get a 90 Day limited warranty. It's not a year. Why? Because they simply don't stand behind their products and for good reason. It is cheap, ineffective, junk. I have owned speaker systems from them and they worked acceptably. So if anything at least heed my advice for all these external sound cards. The technology just isn't there yet.And next time? Make sure you spring for the best graphic and sound card you can afford on your next laptop. I know I will. I am better off going with a wired USB Headset, at least the Logitech USB set I had last sounded great before they broke. This implies USB must be better than these PCMCIA or ExpressCard options. I wish it weren't the case because I like using the side slot because plugging it in the front jacks jab me when it's on my lap, and having it cleanly installed in the laptop is nice too. Oh well.-Cheers.*Product Update:-2 New issues have arisen. 1st, the item gets extremely hot when not in an air conditioned room with a cooler beneath it. This is an obvious detriment to the laptop since heat is its worst enemy. Second, the microphone jack is useless and does not work. It detects the sound of my voice but plays back muffled. It also disabled the main microphone jack from working despite changing the sound configurations in Windows and simultaneously setting the card to ""Play through Windows speakers"". This is a major downfall but COULD be a random issue with this one I got being defective. I am fairly sure it is not because the item ""works"" in every other way and seems new enough but I am being generous to assume it's possible the microphone jack could have been the previously defective issue before it was ""refurbished"" or in this case, just repackaged nicely. I have already requested my Return Merchandise Authorization. I am still shopping for a satisfying alternative so if anyone can suggest a real solution for my setup I would love to hear it."
188,I got this thinking it would be great to have a card w/ lots of memory....wrong. This one glitches and a few of my photos were unable to be read. Upset :(
189,"Update - later that same day:Well I finally got it to work this morning and wrote the review below.  Then I turned off the computer and the transmitter for a short while for lunch.  After lunch the sound was dropping out again and this time no matter what wifi units I turned off it wouldn't work right so I'm not sure just what is wrong (wifi conflict or something else).  At any rate I can't spend hours each day just trying to figure out what needs to be on and off on the wireless network to get this to work so I decided to send it back. It shouldn't be this hard. I think I'm just going to run a darned audio cable to the stereo and forget about all this wireless audio stuff.  Too bad, the sound quality was very good when it was coming through - but having the sound dropping in and out is way too annoying to be able to use it.First the good things:(A)I was disturbed by the proliferation of cables and power supplies for the transmitter since I just wanted to use this for streaming sound from my USB computer to my stereo and I assumed that should only require at most a USB cable to the transmitter, or even better just a USB dongle.  But it turns out the included USB cable is all that is really needed and the other cables and the power adapter are for transmitting sound to the receiver when the transmitter is hooked up only to a non-powered audio input (like the RCA connector inputs). So all those extra things are for making it a multi-functional unit.(B) When connected with the included USB cable to the computer this device installed itself really easily - truly plug and play.  It needed to install the drivers but on Windows 7 it found those by itself.(C)  The audio quality is very good.(D)  The price is very good too.Now the bad stuff:(A) I won't go as far as to say it is a ""network killer"" (as other reviewers have said) since my two Roku wifi TV streaming boxes play fine with no obvious interference when the device is installed. And my wifi printer can be plugged in and sending out all its wifi signals with no apparent interference problem so I can leave it plugged in and turned on without worry. However as soon as my wifi laptop connection is turned on the sound streams through the transmiter/reciever connection drops out repeatedly making it totally useless.  So, while I can watch TV and listen to music at the same time (useless except maybe for teenagers) I can't surf the web while I listen to internet music over my stereo system(which is what I wanted to do) I can fix that by hard wiring the laptop to the modem using ethernet but that defeats the whole wireless thing. I think the problem might be the unit's assigned IP address since as soon as I installed it and turned on the wifi network I got a notice that there was a computer with an IP conflict and I should contact my network administrator (that would be me, unfortunately). That is a really big negative which pretty much wipes out the positives.(B) When I checked on the Creative Labs site for this device a notice comes up saying it is an end of life product and support is limited to the FAQs.  I haven't tried getting in touch with them yet so I don't know if this is really true but it surely is discouraging to have an out-of-the-box user problem and have that sort of notice pop up as soon as you try to research it.(C)  The installation guide that comes with the device is so sketchy it is rather worthless - which is somewhat offset by the plug and play ease of installation -- until you have a problem and need to research it.(D)  The transmitter and receiver units seem to be much larger than they need to be.  Especially the transmitter since you now need to have a USB cable connection to a rather bulky device which somewhat defeats the convenience of being ""wireless.""So, bottom line, if you don't need to connect to the internet and stream your computer audio at the same time this is a real winner considering the price.  But if, like most everyone these days, you have a wifi computer with the wifi always left on you should probably look for something that does not have this wifi conflict (or maybe get a good ""network administrator"" to solve the conflict for you). Or you can connect your computer to your other devices the old fashioned way with ethernet cables --- but a single audio wire pair from your computer's audio out to your stereo in is probably a much better solution than wiring you computer to all your devices via ethernet cables."
190,"I made the mistake of purchasing this flashdrive.  It worked great for a few days, then in the middle of transfering data to the drive, it froze and is 100% dead.  The data is lost.I agree with another reviewer that the rubber outside is great, but if the drive is going to fail, it is WORTHLESS.  The whole point is to preserve the data."
191,"The USB stick is huge, do not buy, You can get a mouse with a MICRO-USB WIRELESS ADAPTER for the SAME PRICE.  This usb adapter is from like 2004 seriously, that thing is annoying."
192,"these work ok for hdd's,but if your using to convert a rom ,you cant load windows through it had to use an external rom,once windows was installed the adapter worked fine."
193,I ordered five of these and three were DOA. Bad experience. The ones that worked sound alright for the price.

195,"I just unboxed this frame, which we bought for the in-laws.  Two days after Christmas, the web site is hammered and the frame can't download photos.  It's not able to download photos from my Flickr stream, e-mails aren't coming in, and if I try several times, I can upload a photo to the web site, but nothing's coming down into the frame.  It's discouraging that this frame is so dependent on the infrastructure of one company-- clearly it's not capable of going directly to flickr on its own.  I wouldn't  buy it again on this fact alone."
196,"I installed this on a Bracketron mount in my wife's Volvo. Gave the dash a rap with my fist, and the iPod flew up and out of the Bracketron so called cradle, falling onto the center console!Certainly no worse than hitting a pothole. Also, it did not seem to hold my iPhone 3G very well either.A waste of money.Chris"
197,"I ordered this case for my HP ProBook 4720s 17"" and it doesn't fit at all. Because it is much to narrow, I have to squash my notebook in somehow so that I have to be glad that the seams don't rip. But on the other hand the case is much to long so that in the vertical scale it is much to sloppy.The other thing is that it smells - somehow toxic. The smell is so acrid that you cannot leave it inside the room you are working, eating or sleeping.  It really was a waste of money."
198,"This is a cheap substitute for the real thing which is the Nuvi built by Garmin.  I had one of these for a week thinking I would save some money.  If you're thinking that too, FORGET IT.  This thing was awful, slow to boot, would freeze up, and it would start with my car 300 yards from my house. It was impossible to use their online update feature so I gave up on that.  The directions are dreadful too, I think if you live in Iowa and the streets are a mile apart fine, but in a crowded area hearing ""turn right in 250 feet"" doesn't help much when that could any one of three right hand turns.  In the end I returned this toy and bought a Garmin Nuvi 750 which is AWESOME.  Great turn by turn nav instructions with street names spoken, much bigger screen, lots of great functionality and none of the silliness you'll never use like Bluetooth for your phone (why I'd want to have a conversation through my nav system I'll never know).  Buyer beware you get what you pay for and sometimes even less and this is DEFINITELY one of those cases."
199,Not worth the money. I bought ASIN: B0015YWKYY instead of this and it works fine for the past 3 months.
200,"Tried burning discs on 3 different computers (with up-to-date burner firmware) at all speeds from the slowest to the fastest and they all failed to burn. Whether it be the disc not being recognized after insertion or failure to write the lead-in, I couldn't get anywhere. I know some people said they got lucky with another spindle I don't want to waste my time and take the chance. I had burned hundreds of the Verbatim DL discs with maybe 3-4 bad discs TOTAL, but was willing to give the Memorex a shot since they were considerably less expensive. I guess the term ""you get what you pay for"" pretty much sums it up. Back to my trusty Verbatim. Avoid these Memorex like the plague."
201,"It is very slow. Highly priced, and I don't use it anymore. You really are better off not buying it, the software also is very poor."
202,"RiteAV - Cat5e Network Ethernet Cable 100ft arrived on time from seller. Quality of cable is sub standard.  If you plug in the cable as is, like most people do, it should work. So what's the big deal?  But I used it to install cable wiring thru the walls and so I had to cut the cable to the desire length.  When reconnecting the cable, I notice the copper wire (most important part of the cable) was thin and wrapped with extra thick plastic insulation for needed support; otherwise the wire might fall apart.  Also no fiberglass insulating material like other better cables, just lots of plastic to appear thicker.  Because the copper was thin and the plastic was thick, connecting it to RJ45 cable plugs and wall plugs was a nightmare. No good connections as the thin copper could not make proper contact because of the extra thick plastic, so I had to trim off the plastic from each and every small wire individually for every single plug point and hope that the wire does not fall apart. Note: there are 8 small twisted wires running thru the Ethernet cable.  Very disappointed and full of regrets, it was too late to turn back as I had cut the cable and fished it thru walls.  Anyone reading this should consider spending a few dollars more for a better name brand cable like ""Belkin""."
203,Like everyone else the auto focus stops working after about a year or so. I also find that sometimes when I focus manually it doesn't come out focused at all. For the people who say get it repaired or it might still be under warranty. Umm no. If it happens to everyone's lens after a certain period of time it's a known defect and poorly produced. They should fix it and recall everyone's for free.
204,would not work with windows 7 ot 8!ugh... intensely frustrating. tried many recommendations. useless. presumably outdated?i'd stay away
205,"Oh it reads like a great product - 3D GPS, fast processor, multi media player.  HOLD ON - it's a piece of CARP!  Got it(thought at a great price), played with it (GPS is decent), wanted to get rid of it quickly.  HP, who were great with their PDA - HP Ipaq 211 is one  the greatest tech toys ever made - totally screwed up the interface and the ""ease of use"".  Why they didn't build on their expertise from the PDA days is beyond me.  The media functions ALL are a joke, unintuitive, and limted in features.  If you're going to sell a product as more than just a GPS, then make sure it delivers on it's promise.  This doesn't - don't bother.  And the final kicker - the battery life is absolutely atrocious. Unless you're carrying around multiple spares, don't even think about being away from a power source for long."
206,"This is a slam dunk video player, BUT...The 705 (at least the 80 gig model) has a serious defect:When playing videos, every time the hard drive spins up to load more data, the video pauses for up to one second. This was a known issue on the 604 and 704, and they released firmware updates on both to correct the condition.I am on my second unit, the first being replaced with a new unit on RMA, and BOTH have the exact same issue. I have been calling Archos every day to report the problem and get some action. So far, they seem to just be ignoring it. So don't buy until you see a firmware update where they address this issue, or this player will drive you NUTS. Every 4 to 6 minutes there is a one second ""freeze' while the disk cache is filled. Very very annoying. Makes it hard to sit down and watch a movie on it, and if you use the SPDIF output, it actually loses the audio for one second, it just goes silent.COME ON ARCHOS ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.If you look at the firmware update history for the 604 or 704, you will see:Version 1.6.20-----------------Improvements:- Photo: allow to turn slideshow transitions off- Videocorder & Audiocorder: audio gain is now from -12dB to +10dB- Videocorder: Widescreen setting in now saved- PDF: Added right to left language supportBug fixes:- Video: high bitrate VOB files with AC3 played jerky- Video: fix video playback pausing for a second when buffering from disk startsThat last line above is EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WITH THE 705. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THIS EXISTS, SAME AS ON THE 604/704SO FIX IT OR DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE."
207,"1. The connectivity is bluetooth and not regular wireless, like other logitech products. So, if your laptop does not have bluetooth you will need to spend money on buying additional bluetooth adapter.2. Within 6 months of buying, I had connectivity issues. Keyboard fails to connect with laptop frequently, which is very annoying.3. Stuck key issues start showing up within 6-8 months.

209,"I purchased a WD7500 external hard drive several years ago to use for backing up my computers. About once per month I would take it out of the fire safe where it was stored, back up two computers, then unplug it and return it to the fire safe.  After about 9 months, when I pulled it out of the fire safe my computers could no longer communicate with it.  I contacted WD, and they replaced the unit.A little over a year later, the replacement unit is no longer recognized by my computers either after being used three times since it was received. Unfortunately it is out of the ""Limited Warranty"" period, so I guess WD won't do anything about it.After having two of these units fail on my after only light use, I will be very wary of WD products in the future. While the price and features were very attractive, its reliability as a long term backup device is terrible."
210,"I absolutely hate Microsoft because of this product.  In the product description, it says you can load protected WMAs to your Zune.  THIS IS A LIE!!!  If you previously bought music from an online store other than Zune Marketplace, you can't add the music to your Zune unless of course you bought and downloaded the entire CD, burned it, then RIP it to your Zune.  If you bought a song here, a couple there, and burned several different artists to a single CD, you can't only RIP them as one album name to your Zune.  Now let's talk about Zune Marketplace.  Sure the songs are cheaper (79 cents per), but you have to buy Microsoft Points to allow you to spend 79 cents per song.  Oh sure you can add them to your Zune and wirelessly share them, but listen to this:  you can't burn them to a CD!  Its a nice device physically, but I'm sending it back because I want my freedom back!  Don't buy a Zune if you value your musical freedom!!!"

212,"**updated review**i initially gave this 5 stars, but am changing this to 1 star. about a week after the installation, the sound to my HU started cutting out. the sound would cut off every now and then, and i would hear about a second of white noise. i thought this was a loose speaker wire, so i removed the HU and looked for loose wires or bad connections. i thought i had it narrowed down to a loose RCA connector. i reinstalled the HU and the next day - same issue. this time, i pulled out the HU with it turned on and gently jiggled each wire on the back of the unit. i was surprised that when i pushed down on the ACC (red) wire right where the harness plugs into the stereo, the HU turned off. i was able to repeat this 3x. from the reviews, some people got lucky and others weren't so lucky. you certainly can't beat the price. however, i am going to recommend that you go with the official Pioneer part. i couldn't find the CDP1095 Pioneer part on Company A and Pioneer wanted $25 + $12 to ship it. so i found a vendor on Company A selling the power harness for the avic-z140bt (part # CDP1479). it is the exact same harness as the CDP1095 for the z110bt, except that some of the wires are labeled differently. i ignored how the wires were lableled on the CDP1479 and used the pin out diagram for the CDP1095. worked perfectly. i don't have experience with the other generic harness that is sold on Company A - i think it's made by xtenzi. frankly, after what i went through with the metra - having to pull the HU out a few times, i just went straight to the authentic part.-----------------------------------------A word to the wise before buying... go to the pioneer parts site to be sure this is the right 16 pin power harness for you. Pioneer has 2 different 16 pin harnesses for their stereos. One is short and tall (same as the metra). The other is long and flat (not the same as this metra). I think this is why you might see a ""doesn't fit"" review on here. The pioneer part number for the Z110BT power harness is CDP1095, which is a perfect match for the metra harness. Once you figure out this is the right replacement, the next think you will need to do is ensure that you know what each color wire on the metra means. for me (and also for you if you have the CDP1095 pioneer power harness), every color was identical to the original pioneer harness except 3 wires on the bottom row of the metra - blue on the pioneer harness (antenna) is blue/white on the metra, violet/white on the pioneer (reverse signal) is navy blue on the metra, and light green on the pioneer (parking brake) is light blue on the metra. I was very happy that I still had the old pioneer power harness because I could not find a pin out diagram for it online. And all the pioneer install guide that came with the head unit shows you is the wire colors. There is no mention of which pin mates to which function, e.g. pin 1 = 12v constant, etc.Here is a list (from the pioneer site) of all the head units that use the CDP1095 power harness: avic-z110bt, avic-f900bt, avic-f90bt, and avicx-910bt. This doesn't mean that this harness won't fit your pioneer if it isn't one of the units I listed. It just means that the wires may be in different locations for other pioneers. for example if you have the z110bt, the power wire might be in at the pin 1 location, but it might be at pin 3 if you have the z120bt... the harness will still fit the z120, you just need to be sure to use the install guide that came with the pioneer and not rely on the color codes given on the outside of the Metra bag so that you wire everything up correctly.I hope this helps someone. Happy installing."
213,"Purchased July 2009, quit working Aug 2011.  Black backlit screen, no images, both ports do nothing.  I should have gone cheaper with LG, I got hung up on a 2ms video response... never did figure out what affect that really had."
214,"Great concept, FAIL-ed product.  Bought this with high hopes, which were quickly smashed to bits.  After 2 weeks of good use, it went into the classic Slacker death-spiral.  No firmware or debugging has helped, it just keeps getting worse every day.  Search the web before buying, this thing is a huge lemon; Slacker has mover on to the ""Second Generation"" unit, the ""G2 Player"", and now this piece of junk is selling at 1/3 of list price.  I am currently trying to return this thing to woot, beware of anything that site sells.UPDATE (6/5/09): While firmware upgrades have made the G1 ""tolerable"" it still has lots of weird problems like saying I need to ""refresh"" stations unless I delete and re-install the station.  Also, it intermittently has a ""Groundhog Day"" issue where every day it burdens me with the exact same play-list.  But I still say it is a lousy 1-Star product because the music database is pathetic also.  I foolishly paid for the ""Premium"" subscription, but many of the music genres don't have much selection as it focuses too much on ""Hits""; also, it pathetically tries to play the same loaded song on genres that do not correlate to that music style.  It it painfully obvious that they much have some payola deal with certain artists because they play certain garbage 10x more than the rest of music.  This company just isn't ready for prime time..."
215,"What more can I say...  Good luck even having your computer identify that you have it plugged in.  And, don't expect any support from Sansa customer support.  Just don't buy this.  I have 2 and both are useless."
216,"I bought these as a Christmas gift (they were a Gold Box Deal). However, they broke the second time that they were used. Since I bought them more than 2 months ago (it was a Christmas gift and I bought them in October), I couldn't return them to Company A.  They weren't cheap either -- around $40 -- so I am not happy.  I makes me have second thoughts about buying gifts on Company A more then a few weeks in advance."
217,"When I ordered this product, the pictures (seller, and customer supplied) showed a 3 conductor stereo part that matched the description.What I received was a 4 conductor part for headsets. The seller responded to my request by changing the (seller) picture. The description still states stereo (3 conductor).Since we needed the described and (formerly) pictured 3 conductor, it did not work in our application. Disappointed son was expecting to use it this past weekend with his X-Box controller and now we have to find another solution. Anyone know who stocks the 3 conductor, with a right-angle plug?Seller also promised to refund my purchase."

222,I have had this cable for months now and it only seems to work on some ear buds. I cannot get this cable to work with any ear buds i have in my house. When i plug the headphones in the sound gets really low and can barely hear any sound.
223,I've been tracking this product ever since it was announced in January. What it offered in terms of convenience was very appealing both in the ability to control a hidden iPod with the steering wheel and that it could chargethe iPod while being used.What I found when using the product was that the sound reproduction was below the quality of what I currently use with a cheap iPod to AUX stereo plug cable (not through the headphone jack). I tried all variations of iPod EQ settings but nothing matched the bass and clarity of what I had before. I phoned Kennsington support and after a wait was told to reset the iPod which had absolutely no affect on the sound. I had the feeling the woman I spoke to hadn't even heard of the unit. An email to tech support was never answered.I also found that the cigarette lighter charger fit loosely into the plug and would sometimes cut the sound as it wasn't making a solid connection. This was in an 07 MINI Cooper so it wasn't like the plug was old and worn!On the plus side the steering wheel function seemed to work OK.My search continues for a device that will work like this but actually reproduces sound like it should.EDIT: I have since discovered the Griffin AutoPilot to be a pretty good solution. I can change songs with the switch on top of the cig charging unit  (close to the driver on a Cooper) and the sound is very good. It has a switch to choose between two settings depending on what you are playing through. The lighter setting was what the LiquidAux sounded like and the deeper setting is what I am use to hearing. I don't know what this switch does on the AutoPilot but the LiquidAux sure needs it.
224,"I bought this slim charger over ebay. To my surprise, it is actually slightly heavier than the standard charger and is larger overall, albeit slimmer. The cord is also 1 to 2 feet shorter. Thus, with this charger you have a trade off of slimness for price, volume, weight, and cord length. I paid $80 for this adapter after shipping costs but believe it is worth under $40."
225,"This is a long review, which compares real world copying with this (Sabrent) USB 3 enclosure to my current generic USB 2 enclosure, and surprisingly this enclosure is not faster, even on USB 3 host, with transfers to it, containing lots of files. This is why I DO NOT recommend this device at all. Find another one, who knows what results you will get.For the test I used two different computers one with USB 3 & USB 2, and one with just USB 2. For the primary test, I copied the ""My Documents"" folder (1.2 GB, containing 2,916 files). From internal HDD (C) to External USB 2 and USB 3 enclosures (one at a time).Firt both on the computer with only USB 2 (I reproduced these on the computer that had both, using it's USB 2 port):USB 2 took 2 min 16 seconds for an average speed of 9 MB/sUSB 3 (this device) took 6 min 36 seconds for an average speed of 3 MB/sLet me state again, this was the exact same HDD in both enclosures performing the exact same copy. I re-did this test 3 separate times with identical results! Very disappointing. Since I use my USB drives on computers without USB 3, this is a big deal. Not to mention a HUGE difference in speed (this Sabrent device was 3 TIMES slower than a generic USB 2 enclosure)!! I tested this additionally with the one two different computers the results were within 4 seconds of each other.Now for the same test on the computer with USB 3 ports:USB 3 (this device) took 5 min 53 seconds for an average speed of 3 MB/s. Which is marginally faster than when it was on a USB 2 host, but still WAY behind the USB 2 enclosure.USB 2 took 2 min 12 seconds for an average speed of 9 MB/sBy comparison the same copy using eSATA completed in 1 min 37 seconds for an average speed of 13 MB/s. Which is where USB 3 should be at, not 3 MB/s.In all fairness this is a HARD copy for USB, since there are so many files, and USB has a lot of overhead, this greatly slows down the overall transfer rate. However, this is a great test to see how well your actual performance is, and real world performance, unless you are just transferring a bunch of huge media files.Doing the same copy back to the computer from the USB enclosures was faster:USB 3 (this device) on a USB 3 host took only 53 seconds for an avg of 23 MB/sUSB 3 (this device) on a USB 2 host took 1 min 21 seconds for an avg of 15 MB/sUSB 2 (old reliable) on USB 2 & USB 3 hosts took 1 min 19 sec for 16 MB/s avgNow this is much better. So it's primarily the writing performance of the chip that really stinks.For larger file transfers there was MUCH less difference, however on a USB 2 host this device was ALWAYS slower than my USB 2 enclosures. Which is why I'm sending it back.To be fair, when I copied 2 files for a total size of 6.34 GB, this device averaged 77 MB/s which is not bad, certainly faster than USB 2 can ever go! However, on USB 2 it dropped to 22 MB/s and my USB 2 enclosure averaged 26 MB/s, for that particular transfer that is a difference of almost a full minute. This thing should not be slower than a USB 2, it just shouldn't.Another strange note is when I was deleting the above mention Docs folder (with almost 3,000 files in it). On eSATA, internal HDD, and USB 2 it was deleted within 5 seconds (which is to be expected). However on the Sabrent USB 3 (this device) it took 1 min and 40 seconds!!!! Explain that? (on both USB 2 & USB 3, crazy ridiculous SLOW). Completely unacceptable!Sorry for the long review it's hard to convey all that.Also, I ran benchmark test on this using ATTO Disk Bench 2.47. And this device completely destroyed my USB 2 enclosure in ""performance"" both read & write, by A LOT!!!. So I consider similar benchmark-based test utterly meaningless. Sorry if that sounds negative."
226,"I purchased this hard drive for use with my MBP about a month or so  back after reading a great review in Macworld,After a month it started making strange noises, I had to unmount it and unplug it. When I tried to use it again it was dead, it did not spin at all. The light went on, but that was it. I called tech support and they had me return it. It cost $25 for me to send it back, they insist that you insure it. I won't be using LaCie Hard drives anytime soon"
227,"Wouldn't connect up to internet, had to reset.  Battery life is short.  Loses WiFi connection easily.  Should have paid a little more for newer model."
228,"Just got it today and I'm very disappointed. first of all it barely fits my 46"" tv and I'm wondering if it can even support the weight of the tv. Feels like its made out of thick aluminum. I'm gonna have to call them to see if they will cover the cost if there product fails and my tv falls, if they don't I'm returning this item. I wish company's would tell you when there products are sub pair."
229,"My boyfriend bought this mount for his new Samsung 51"" plasma. Because the overall review score for this product is very high, he didn't really read the negative reviews. BIG MISTAKE. This mount is advertised as a tilt mount that will angle your tv up to 15 degrees. However, we have found that this mount is actually a giant piece of crap that not only DOES NOT TILT your tv, but also BREAKS YOUR CORDS AND INPUTS ON YOUR TV. That's right; this mount broke our brand spankin' new Samsung. This is why:* This mount does not move your tv away from the wall enough to allow room for cords such as the power cord, HDMI, coaxial, AV, composite, etc. So unless you are planning on not plugging your tv into anything and just staring at a black screen all the time, this will be a problem for you.* Because there is not enough room for your cords, they are crushed between the tv and the wall which is not only bad for the cord, but can apparently also break your tv. The stress caused by the audio cable being pressed into the input completely broke the casing around the optical audio port. The cord can't even be plugged in now, it just falls back out. So now we'll have to pay to get our brand new tv fixed.* This mount also does not reach a 15 degree tilt, even with no cords attached to the tv! How incredibly stupid is that?!  The reason is that the ledge on the bottom of the part that mounts to the wall simply does not match up with the bottom ledge on the part that attached to your tv anywhere between about a 5 to 15 degree tilt. So while the top part is set at an angle, the bottom is being pushed out, thus cancelling out most of the angling you're getting on the top. The result is a tv that may as well be mounted flat to the wall - you can only hope to get a tilt of 5 degrees or less, which is basically nothing.I am shocked that this product gets any good reviews. The mount is flimsy, the tilt doesn't work, and there is a good chance that using this mount will break your cords, tv, or both. This is the third tv my boyfriend and I have mounted and It's the only time we've had any problems. We both own quite a bit of tech and tech accessories and we're both surprised this thing is even being made; it is literally the worst tech accessory we have ever purchased. My only guess is that a lot of people buying this mount didn't need the tilt and have not yet realized that their cords are being squished between the tv and the wall. That will be a nasty shock when they start having problems with their tv...or when they take the tv off the mount and all their cords just fall out. If you're already purchased this mount, I would encourage you to check your tv and cords for damage. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUNT unless you're going for the `un-tilted broken tv' look."
230,"I bought these walkies a few weeks ago and they worked for for less then a day. The batteries run out super fast, NO MATTER what kind you use! One of the walkies wouldn't work at all when I went to use it the second day... they took NO abuse of any kind. It just stopped working. Very poor quality. You really do get what you pay for...$20 for good walkies, NO WAY! I'll never buy a Uniden product ever again."
231,"I bought this and it has the features (USB, SD MP3) but lacks basic things like both Front and Rear speaker outputs.  You only have left and right.  If you only have left and right speakers (like in an old truck) then this may work for you.  If you have front and rear, this system offers nothing to fade in or out. No balance between left and right.  This stereo distorts real bad no matter which way you wire it, either parallel, just single-left/right or in series LR,LF + RF, RR.I also tested this with different bit-rate mp3's and neither 128, 192, or 320 made a difference.  The stereo just overloads and distorts.  The speakers I used were stock speakers that were used with a Kenwood system that had the face-plate stolen, so I had to replace it.  Unfortunately I chose this model without reading the other reviews and am disappointed.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something decent, and I regret it now.  It wouldn't be so bad if the system was a little clearer at higher volumes, but this device performs dismally.Lastly, I did notice that the FM radio is pretty decent in it, and relatively clear sounding at higher volumes with regular radio stations, but I listed to heavy metal and the mp3s sound awefull.  Even clean synth music is very distorted.  Perhaps there is a problem with the MP3 Playback on the device, but that is what I listen to."
232,Won't hold the presets. Comes  on by itself.  To hard to reset the presets. No ryme or reason to its function settings.
233,Not a good product is all I can say because of the driver installation problems. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I would recommend D-Link item.
234,Very flimsy when connected I needed to put a spacer of some sort behind it when in use. Poor design.
235,"I travel quite a bit and I bought two of these so I could take these on my assorted journeys to Seattle, Tennessee to visit family, shortly to Tucson to visit family and friends, and I got these because they were cheap, and it would not break my heart if I lost one or both of them.They are plug and play devices like my 8 gig slider that I use when I am home. First time you use them they go online to get the software you need.These MP3 have major downsides.1. the software the device download from the net STINKS. I would not recommend you use the software unless you have to. I just clicked on my computer and sent the files to the device2. The earbuds that come with the player is just about useless. the sound is OK just moves around in my ears and the sound fades in and out. I would recommend you ditch the earbuds and buy some decent quality earbuds I bought JVC marshmallow earbuds to use with these.3. Mine have one big problem. When I stop play back the light goes on steady for about 30-60 seconds the light goes out completely and I can not turn it on again without removing the battery cover, removing and replacing the battery then the device is automatically in play mode.4. Another complaint for some reason I can not log into the player with ""My computer at all and the stinking software for the device is no bad i refuse to use it.I would recommend you buy something better unless you are like me who was looking for something cheap to travel with and I would not care if I lost them. In less than 3 ounces I have 4 gigs of audio, earbuds, and two or three spare batteries.When these get lost or stop working I will get another player for traveling but it will NOT be a Coby!The ONLY other MP3 players I have experience with are my 8 gig Lyra Slider, and a 4 gig San disk that I would not recommend to my worst enemy. That piece of (fill in the blank) did not come with a CD, and using it at all was impossible for two reasons.1. the player will not work without the CD.2. I use an Acer Netbook that does not have a CD or DVD player at all."
236,"Too much magnification for sky viewing. The zoom is pretty much useless as well. These NEED to be mounted on a tripod to be used at all since they have so much magnification, if you try to just hold them in your hands it is impossible to hold still enough.  Also I was unable to bring a single star into view, it would appear as 2 stars.. I heard this is a problem with these binoculars."
237,"I bought this router about 6 months ago. It was very easy to install and setup. I haven't had any problems getting anything connected to it, but what makes it horrible:1) after only 6 months I lose all connectivity (wired and wireless) on average twice per day. I have to power-cycle to fix it. I upgraded it to the latest firmware 1.0.04, but that didn't help.2) customer service is terrible. I did online chat which worked well, but all they did was have me switch mtu from 1500 to 1492 and said to call back if the problem didn't go away and request an RMA. I called today, but there was no RMA option so I picked support. I told the tech I needed an RMA only to have to give all of my information again just so she could tell me I selected the wrong option on the phone menu and I needed to call back. I'm now on hold waiting for customer support and the message is saying ""you can't get an RMA without an RMA code from Tech Support"" (and no they didn't give me one). Now that is bad service!"
238,"This does not work with Windows XP SP3.  Multiple calls to tech support finally found someone who admitted what was rapidly becoming obvious.  He said that many of their units were having problem with SP3.  Since I wanted the latest firmware (which was not on my brand-new unit) I was told that I should revert to SP2 or wait for Windows 7 to do the update.  Junk Junk Junk Junk.  My old Magellan switched from map view to list of turns with one button press.  Now you need three presses on different areas on the touch-screen to go from the map to the turn-by-turn, and three presses to get back to the map.  Junk Junk Junk Junk.  Junk company & junk product.  Run.  Run.  Run."
239,"After shooting, or rather trying to shoot with this lens for a year all I can say that this lens is awful, pretty much wasted money. I give up. I came back from a hike today and pretty much all images shot with this lens at above 300mm have to be trashed. My 7D has hard time focusing at full 500mm on a bright sunlit day, I have to focus manually most of the time. AF is unbearably slow in general,missed shots everywhere. Also, this is basically a 300mm lens. Anything above 300mm is garbage. I haven't seen chromatic aberrations this bad on rock bottom lenses. There is no sharpness too. Even shooting at ISO3200 and speeds over 1/2000 from a monopod the images come out blurry. It's not motion blur either, it's just this lens lacks sharpness at above 300mm and all edges are fuzzy. It's awful. And the threads have worn out and I can't attach any filters to this thing any more. I can't even sell this junk because I will feel bad about whoever buys this from me. That's what happens when you cheap out, I should have bout the Canon 100-400L lens. My mistake."
240,I want just plain around the neck sweatproof headphones. These have pods that go in your ears. Dislike this item.
241,Purchased the KVM switch to use with 2 2560x1440 monitors (Midnight U2711).  This KVM switch does not pass the DP signal properly and the display signal is garbled when using the switch on the monitor.Monitor/Computer setup works fine without the switch in the middle.DO NOT BUY!!!
242,"This not an authentic Canon battery, despite the packaging's efforts to look like the real thing.My local Canon distributor was also of the opinion that it's counterfeit.Obvious differences between this product and authentic:- Corners are sharp/pointed; Authentic are rounded- Finish is poor with gaps visible between the end cap and main section of the batter; Authentic is high quality with no gaps.- Labelling looks different.- States it is made in Japan; Authentic are madIt was obvious from the moment that I opened the package that something was up.  I've had over 10 different Canon cameras over the years, and never before have I seen batteries with this poor quality finish.I've photos of both for comparision too; if I can post them somewhere I will!"
243,"A white piece of plastic that holds my camera's battery near a wall socket, but does nothing electrically.  Returned.I'm sure I just got unlucky, but thought y'all deserve to know that wherever these are coming from they don't all work."
244,"Don't waste your money on this, the reception quality is terrible, they only want your $40.00 coupon."
245,After 3 weeks i got it in.I figured it would not be the best quality because of the price but i just wanted something basic.It is so cheep i'm sure if i had it in my hand and closed it hard it would fall apart in one second.Even worst it comes with no instructions at all just a bag.You would think it would be easy to figure out but no.I contacted the seller and asked for help no response.No matter what i do i can't get it to do anything or even get my pc to detect it.Not worth my time to even send back just threw it in the trash.To think i almost waited a month for this.
246,"Tried two sets in my white Intel Macbook 13"".Could not get either set to work. I am dual booting OS X and windows 7, both crashed soon after installing this memory. Everything went back to normal after putting the original 2gb memory back in.So I don't know if this was two sets of bad memory or if this was not compatible with my Macbook."
247,"didn't work whatsoever. plugged it in, part light came on, but no response from either system that anything was installed."
248,"This is definitely a &#34;you get what you paid for&#34; item.  I just couldn't get it attached, and it's too flimsy when using a battery pack (regardless of what some other reviewers stated.)  I gave it away to somebody who owns a more light weight Canon."
249,My husband and myself tried to set this up.WE have 2 TCL tv's that we puchased from Company A. Let me say they do compare to by 46  Samsung I use. NO codes for TCL and I couldn't get it to manually take either. Guess I will have to return or just stick in drawer.
250,"i bought one from walmart, and the quality of sound was awful. I ended up throwing the unit away and keeping the speakers as junk. Its pure trash."
251,"I did what I could to make these work, but they never did. They were really inexpensive though. I will keep them in hopes that maybe I can get them to be of some use."
252,Bought this flash after reading the reviews. Under normal usage my flash broke in one month. I wrote to Minox USA who handles the warranty here in the US. They wrote back promptly and I sent my flash in. Did I get a new flash? No. They simply sent back my broken flash with no response.
253,The unit has always had issues with charging and playing from my iPod touch.  It was as if it did not recognize the iPod. Same with the iphone.  Usually would work if the unit was turned on and off a few times. Now nothing. Called JBL and was told the unit is not reparable.  Not very nice.
254,it didn't do i wanted it to do which was transfer files from my old computer to my new computer.  It's built in software stopped me in my tracks.
255,"I tried it with every one of my hard drives. Nothing. Dead. Well, I took a chance, at least it's only five bucks squandered."
256,"The radio would only work from time to time.  There is something about the Internet radio that takes it off line. So I call C Crane for help, ""well sorry we are on our way to the parking lot"".  ""Call us tomorrow"". I ask, ""will you call me be back"", C Crane says, ""well we will try"".  So far No call back, and the fact I was told by C Crane that stations come and go, this is not the answer.  C Crane customer service could care less.  Do not buy unless you are willing to learn about how to operate this on your own.  Sad, very sad. You can NOT count on C Crane for help.  Buyer be ware."
257,"This item worked for burning only 2 DVDs then simply quit.  I tried both of the included plugs as well as all my USB ports, but it is just dead.  I was very disappointed because I loved the compact size and how well it recorded those 2 DVDs.  Save your money!"
258,"Firm needs to get its act together, this is a joke. I'm going to buy a mac so I can use elgato again."
259,Purchased this as a gift for an ex boyfriend. It was dead on arrival. We broke up so I didn't bother getting it exchanged or returned.
260,"I received this wire and when I went to connect it to my tv, it did not work. It was not compatible with the tv. I was really disappointed as I feared it wouldn't work after reading previous reviews but I went ahead and gave it the benefit of the doubt. I then put the wire away, which is still in the same wrapping. I did not return it because I read in a preview review that they charge a 20% restocking fee, which was way more then the wire is even worth.However I went ahead and contacted them today cause I figured maybe it wouldn't hurt. I received a email saying I can't return it because I placed my order on December 28th. I received the wire Jan 5th. I was seriously disappointed, that I received an email stating they won't help me. Now I see why they received the negative reviews. I will be one as well!"
261,I bought it and right off the get go the stupid thing would crackle. you know how you have to maneuver wires for a earphone so it'll play it through both ear pieces? yeah it was like that. waist of my money and time. if you want something that will work DONT BUY THIS.
262,"I bought this lock to protect my iMac two years ago.  I recently moved to a new apartment and tried to remember the code to unlock it.  As I had forgotten the code, but wanted to move the desk without the computer locked, but loose on the top, I took a pair of medium sized wire cutters and cut the cable.  I was quite surprised on how easy it was to cut the cable, granted it is not very thick.This is only a slight deterrent.  Given basic theft preparations, the computer was really not secure.Now I need a new lock, I will be looking for a thicker cable that offers better protection from theft."
263,"I received 2 free Blueproton memory card readers with my sd card orderand my daughter got 1 free with something she ordered.NONE of the three worked at all, not with anyones computer.I assume thats why Blueproton was giving them away!Profiting on S&H; on an unsellable defective product.Any way I was charged $16.00 for S&H;, but I phoned Company A,and they were very nice and refunded that amount.All turned out o.k., my daughter also received the S&H; refunded.We didn't get any memory card readers that workedbut it's nice that Company A protects the buyer in such unfair situations."
264,"This device has the option to bend the top part up to 90 degrees to make it fit better into whatever space you have in your car.  The first time I bent it, both the black and red wires snapped, making it useless.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I only wished I'd saved the packaging so I could return it."
265,"I purchased a bunch of these for stocking stuffers at Christmas.  First, they didn't arrive until January 8 and secondly, they work poorly.  The one I took out of the package to see how well they worked started flashing like small strobe lights.  When the flashing subsided, 6 of the 11 LEDs had stopped working.  I just threw the whole package in the trash.  Maybe the low price should have tipped me off: You get what you pay for.  OR, maybe that is the energy savings part of the deal; less than half of the LEDs work saving you over half of the energy cost."
266,I ordered three of these to replace 1.3a HDMI cables I had due to going to a Samsung 3D TV and 3D Blu Ray player.  My 1.3a HDMI cables were passing everything but I felt for the price it would be better to get true 1.4 certified HDMI cables.  When I hooked them up I started to get video and audio drop outs. Reconnected my original HDMI cables and it went away. I had the 3rd cable to connect to my PS3 going to my Pioneer Elite AV AMP. Same issue as above. Put old cable back and problems went away.The percentage of happy customers is much greater than those of us experiencing the issues. I was hard pressed to explain this and returned the cables and will purchase from Monoprice where my original HDMI cables were purchased. Even though they are only 1.3a version HDMI cables they are passing 3D fine. I didn't think they would work so I am hoping with true 1.4 HDMI I will see better 3D.
267,"This cable was highly reviewed and I needed a long HDMI to go between my receiver and projector but I immediately noticed this cable had a hard time fitting in the slot on the projector.  Continued testing and projector would intermittently lose signal.  Re-tested with other HDMI cables and no problem, so must have got a dud.  Returned through Company A, UPS picked up box next day from my house.  Easy peasy.  The next one I'm trying is going to be a BlueRigger."
268,This is the 2nd one I bought and just like the first one it just stopped working. The first one lasted about 15 months but this one lasted for just 1 road trip. The power out put when it stopped operating correctly was 1.5 volts. Not enough to run my Garmin Nuvi 205. I will now purchase a power outlet and use the cable that came with the GPS.
269,It did not work at all.  Resorted to wireless and compromised for now.  It is useless!  Buy a better quality and definitely not from this vendor.
270,"I've had good luck with every Netgear I've ever owned for the past few years. Got it in December 2008, began the process of death in March 2009. Now, middle of April 2009, it has died the good death.  Started needing reboots about once a week after 3 months. The need for reboots has become increasing common - now it needs it every day if not more than once a day. I've decided to toss it.It's a shame - Netgear used to be a great brand. I've noticed reviews of Netgear products going steadily downhill over the years and didn't think anything of it due to my (what I now realize) good luck.  Now I've been lumped in with everybody else in realizing Netgear's quality has gone to shambles in recent time. I won't be buying Netgear again - not just because of this experience, but because of the increasingly-common negative reviews I've read about just about all of their products here at Company A and at other sites.  Due to the reviews of Netgear's recent customer service quality I've also decided that it isn't worth the headache & heartache of working through the warranty process. So, it's going in the trash & I'll buy another brand."
271,"You can read my full review of the Next Gen extender on that product site. This is just about these emitters.They stink! They don't transmit through the backside where the adhesive attaches them to your component (unlike the Xantechs). So, you have to find a way to direct the beam, form the top surface of the emitter, into the component from a short distance away. How do you do that without hanging them mid-air? It's tough. You have to devise supports in some cases. In other cases, I attached two emitters, back to back, and hung them in front of two components and that increased effectiveness.These don't seem to transmit a solid signal reliably. I had to constantly send separate signals to various devices with my Harmony 650 remote. It will take you quite a long time to find the correct positioning of these and they will be jostled out of place over time, requiring re-positioning work again.Spend the extra money and get the Xantech DL85K system. It works perfectly."
272,I bought this for an HP laptop that is fairly light... however I could not use this fan at all!!! It was so thin & flimsy that as soon as I sat the laptop on it the fans pushed into the surface of my lap tray and begin to make this loud noise... It is a good idea but this product is not made to support a normal sized laptop... maybe a netbook or something but not a real laptop. it is too thin & not very well made. ;)
273,"I bought this for my son who has a Toshiba laptop of average size.  Right out of the box, we were skeptical.  It was smaller than we had expected, probably more suited for a netbook.  The other concern was the plastic is very thin and easily bent.  But the main concern was that the fans are exposed - there are no covers or guards over them and though they are weak, it's still not a pleasant experience to get your fingers clipped or things tangled up in them.  The only good thing about it was that it looked really cool when it was working, sadly, it only worked for a month. Save your $$"
274,"it is west of money to buy it, i did last for two or three weeks and throwin in the garbage. never gonna buy such this products"
275,"Product appearance exibited quality and product had many advertised features, but the device would not project a screen image, so after trying on 2 different computers and throughly following installation instructions, I assumed it was defective and returned it."
276,"I bought this battery for my Midnight Company I 1500. Everything seemed to work fine the first 45 days or so. Then for no apparent reason this battery died. Just like that.This  battery comes with a one year warranty. So I contacted Company A customer service. Of course, I am out of their 30 day period to send it back. They asked me to contact the manufacturer (NG). Company A doesn't even know what NG is, and what the contact info is. They asked me to contact the seller (Westronics).I called Westronics. Left them a voicemail. Haven't heard back from them yet. If there is any progress I'll update this review. But for now, this battery is a piece of junk and customer service is the worst."
277,"I purchased this instead of the brookstone model. What a waste of money, throwing these out along with the $50 I wasted."
278,"After 2 weeks it suddenly starting acting flaky. Now even though its recognised by my PC(s) , its asking to be formatted !!Donot waste your time, $$$ and precious data buying this !"
279,"I purchased an adapter from OPTIMUM SOLUTIONThe plug was too loose, but the adapter worked okay for 12 months.It died 3 days after that. The answer was ""sorry your warranty expired.""It's fine if you only need it for 1 year.Otherwise my advice is: ""DO NOT BUY!"""
280,If you keep your laptop on your lap and expect this pad to keep the laptop cool. Does not work as advertised.To expensive and not worth the money.
281,"I ordered a few of these cables and have had the worst of luck.  They are not compatible with more than half of my video equipment and have caused issues with almost all of the rest of them.  The cable itself look like quality goods, but one of the cables tip came off after a week.  Will never purchase from this company again.  Not worth the effort."
282,"I purchased this product about a year ago while I was deployed. So it was waiting for me when I got back. I was all excited to play with a new toy just to find that it didn't do anything as advertised.Putting the parts for the docking station was easy, and everything seemed pretty solid. It says to let the robot charge fully before using it, so I went to bed and woke up the next morning.I installed the software on my computer, and got the rovio and everything communicating with my wireless network. Upon operating the robot, it had a noticeable 10 second delay between the online commands, and the picture quality was complete crap. Also, the lights that the docking station projects on the wall seem to not work, I dont know if it is because I have a spackle ceiling, but that is a big let down.I read reviews about how there is a known problem with the batteries not holding a charge, and I experienced that, contacted the WowWee support and they told me to basically keep trying to use it. Well, I deployed again and just got back to my whole ""trying again"" stage and I wasted a good 200 bucks on a crappy plastic paperweight."
283,"I have never been able to get it to use my iPod as an alarm clock.  Also, if your iPod locks it does not play.  Overall, a great alarm clock if you do not want to use the iPod features.  A shame--this could have been a great product if it weren't for a couple of fatal technical flaws."
284,"Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to order two of these.I ended up taking a laminated sheet, from a package of sheets (which I bought at staples for a bout $8.00), and cut outting the perfect screen protector for the Zen X-FI.  Not only does the laminated sheet stay on better, but the morons who created their ""Screen Protectors"", designed it so that you will see a blurred screen, on the corner where you peel the lamination off, and apply it on to the screen."
285,"I struggled with this damnable taiwanese piece of nothing for a while, and I regret buying it.  I am going to throw mine away and never buy rocketfish products again.You would think that these things implement a bluetooth standard, and perhaps they do, but they are not all the same.  I was trying to pair mine with a headset and a toshiba soundbar.  It failed to pair with both in windows 7.  In windows 8, it will pair with both, but the audio quality is unusable.  Imagine talking on 1G cellphone in the middle of a remote field.  Sound breaks up and is glitchy, unusable.Don't buy this product.  You're much better off getting a 4-5 dollar chinese dongle on Company A, and getting 4 different kinds for the price of this, then throwing them away as they work about as well as rocketfish's.  In fact, I bet one of them is a private labeled rocketfish, so don't you feel dumb spending 20 dollars like me?"
286,"Research showed two different antennas to be top rated: this one, and another by Terk. When the Winnegrand arrived I was surprised to see how huge it was.  Opening the box I was very disappointed at the flimsy nature of the materials and the build quality.  The biggest issue was the assembly, which was absurd. Perhaps an experienced engineer could put this together, but certainly not a normal person. It's the design that is so vexing, and the directions are worthless. After sweating over it for an hour, I was so frustrated that I immediately packed it up and sent it back.  I bought the Terk locally, as a chain store matched the online price.  It is VERY well built, and a cinch to put together--it took less than 5 minutes.  Once together, attaching it was just as easy, and the signal strength and picture are amazing. The Terk wins in a slam dunk."
287,"Edited 03/30/2009 - I was contacted by Logitech shortly after posting this review, offering to send me a new unit to try out. Major kudos to a company for monitoring AND acting on feedback.  I just tried out the replacement, and it works like a charm.  Perfect size, hooks to the lid of my netbook, and it does everything I wanted it to do when I originally requested it for review through Company A Vine.  I'd change the rating to a 5 if I was allowed to, but the review system doesn't allow me to change the rating, only the review text.  So, if you're wondering why I rated it a 1 before, it's because the first one was DOA.  This replacement (and the company's response) is pure 5.I received this through the Company A Vine program, and I was really looking forward to it.  I just got a new Acer netbook, and I was happy that I would have a mini-mouse for it, along with a cool way to secure it to my netbook so I wouldn't lose it.  Unfortunately, the unit was completely dead-on-arrival...I changed batteries, tried a different computer, nothing.  Now I'm left with the tab attachment on the lid of my netbook with no mouse to hook on it.Nice idea, and I'm sure I got that 1 in 1000 unit that didn't work.  Disappointing nonetheless..."
288,"I got this device a little over a month ago. I could not access the UI, neither did it work with the set-up disk. I called tech Support and after trying a bunch of things I was able top set it up. A few weeks later it just stopped working, even though the lights were on. I accessed the UI and had to reboot the device internally and it started working. About 2 weeks after that, it stopped working again, and no matter what I did could not access the User Interface. I called Tech Support btu they could not get it to work either. So i have sent it back and Hawking witll send a replacement (refurbished) unit back soon, I hope. I would suggest buy something else, this is not reliable, even though it worked quite well, which it worked."
289,"Its cheaply made and stopped turning on after the first week thats even if it worked at all to begin with. Lesson learned for me, you get what you pay for."
290,I bought a battery from Sunvalley Tek. It was defective. It took 6 days for Sunvalley Tek to acknowledge they received the battery by cancelling the sale. They had promised by email that I would receive a replacement promptly and they would refund my return costs.I would not trust Sunvalley Tek if I were you.
291,"I purchased this item on (Order Date: July 23, 2012 ). It sits on a TV in our basement that is NOT used very often. The plastic is still on the face panel. Well.., it no longer works. It won't power on. I've tested all outlets, it does NOT work. It lasted almost 4 months.. and at approximately $50.00 I would expect a LOT more. And.., this is sold by Company A, LLC, who usually has a very liberal return policy.., but NOT on this item. It cannot be returned. So, for $50 every 4 months I can plan on spending $150 per year on just this piece..., who ever said over the air TV was free??"

293,"Once I installed this software it slowed my PC to a ridiculous pace. I have a Windows XP, Pentium 4, 3.05 Ghz processor. It locked up consistently once I installed this. It even quarantined a file that had to do with my LAN high speed connection to where I could not log online anymore.Once Quarantined, a file can not be restored. Nortorn's tech dept. could not and WOULD NOT help me to get the system back online and said to call my ISP provider; even though their product was the reason I could not log on anymore due to the software and the file it quarantined.I ended up uninstalling the software with no luck. Due to the file missing now, I could not establish a connection. Cox's upper tier tech support could not have been more helpful. Even though it was not their problem, as I had a signal to the modem from their end so they were not responsible but they reconfigured my connection and recommended the free version of McAfee from Cox.That process to get me back online took them amost an hour but they got it figured out with no excuses. You would think it was as simple as setting up a high speed connection but the IP address that the PC was now using was not even close to what it needed to be to establish a connection. I wish I could say that Norton's techs were helpful, but you could tell that all they do is type in a question and read the answer that their PC spits out. That is why their tech support did not know anything about LAN connections. I knew more than both of their tech support guys I spoke with did. So if you think Norton's tech support can help you, think again.I installed the McAfee which I really was never a fan of just because of the menu, but it performs flawless and my PC is almost as fast as when it came out of the box. It is 10x's faster than what it had Norton. I have never had a problem with the plain Norton antivirus software, but this Internet Security 2009 may just have too much going on in the backround to slow down your PC.Don't buy it!"
294,"The good: works (kinda)The bad: loses connection (some times), connection sounds bad(all the time), can't listen to music, can't make phone calls from my computer (sounds bad), cannot be more than 5 feet way to connect, data transfer is extremely slow, does not play nice with all computersit's not worth it"
295,"The stitching for the carabiner and belt loop gave out the first time I used it, after about 30 minutes.  I got home, opened the case, and the carabiner fell off.  It's either a poor design or poor quality control.Other than that, it's quite a bit larger than it needs to be but I like the basic design."
296,"This system never worked for me.  But I gave it to a friend and it works fine, so maybe I had a bad antenna or connection going up to it."
297,"I got this as a gift after being really hesitant about going with the company, but the features won me over. Out of the box things worked great and while there were times that the link up took a little longer than expected (5 minutes or more) everything was fine. I updated the software to the latest one and my device went into permanent paper weight mode. I have been contacting customer support for the last 2 months and have had no response. I guess as long as the device is under warranty they do not want to help the customer. The worst past about all this is that I know its faulty software and if they allowed the user to choose to go back to a previous version of their software things would (hopefully) get back to working.When it worked it was great, now that it doesn't it is horrible. After reading several reviews on how this problem is happening with several customers with all the Navigon devices, I am surprised that someone hasn't started a class action suit against the company (there seem to be over 100 poor reviews from customers sharing their same type of stories about all their devices).Until they get their act together stay away! If you already have one be sure to make a back up before you do any updates on software or the maps otherwise you risk the screen of death on this device!"
298,It came today so I tried it on my Windows 7 Pro system. After half an hour I had figured out the extra steps I had to use to navigate around my games and documents compared to my older Logitech Trackman Wheel Optical that wasn't usable by left-handers. Having a left-hander in the family I figured I'd give this a try and give one to my family member. After an hour using this thing I had severe hand cramps and had to switch back to my older device which is just plain wearing out. The two tiny wheels that the marble rolls on in both my older version and in this new version are worn down in my older one that has seen many years of use. I really miss the scroll wheel and while it is possible to navigate using this thing it isn't nearly as easy or comfortable. This thing doesn't support my hand the way my old one did. I found the old version but at well over 4 times what I paid for it years ago! At this point I'm wondering if I can take this thing apart and use the tiny plastic tracking bearings in the old one to give it new life! I may just return both of these disappointments. I can't see giving this thing as a present to anyone let alone my left handed family member!
299,"I hardly ever give any product a one star, but I just had to for this. Why? Simply because the key combo W+Shift+space is blocked. (W=walk forward) (shift=sprint) (space= jump). MUST FOR FPS GAMERS Even a cheap $5 keyboard would not do this. Logitech did this so they would force gamers to get the Company G keyboards. Shame on Logitech for doing this kind of thing. I basically bought this keyboard and returned it within the hour. I just wasn't going to use a keyboard that had keys blocked like that... Other than that everything else was pretty good. I love laptop style keys. Either way I'm sticking with my Apple Wireless keyboard that I run strictly on windows."
300,"The bluetrack technology didn't work well for me at all. I couldn't use it on my wooden floor!Also, the blue light started failing on me and my mouse started acting up even when I was using a mouse pad. It also didn't hold it's charge for more than 2 days before blinking red.Sigh..."
301,"I am really unhappy about the way the guaranty was handled.  At first Ocean Reef wanted to count the date that I placed the order as my first day of the guaranty.  I received the item in 5 days.  It worked great when I got it.  No problems until: ..................  IT FAILED ON THE 32nd DAY I owned it. OCEAN REEF refused to allow me to exchange it or return it.  I appealed to them 3 times, but the answer was NO!YES I UNDERSTAND THAT 30 DAYS IS 30 DAYS, but, this is like a bomb with a fuse on it.  I suggest that you find a vendor that realizes their name is a valuable commodity.I do not know what other people have had for luck with this company, but I am sure disappointed.  To top that off, it stopped working on the 29th day, but I did not report it until the 32nd day of posession.I made three attempts to explain my point of view then gave up.  Oddly, they contacted me again to review it, but I do not need any more aggravation.  This is not about win or lose.  This is about a company that shows no leeway in their point of view.I originally rated them a five star.  One must be cautious with their ratings."
302,This ipod lasted me maybe 3 weeks. The screen cracked a lil and this cause the entire ipod to go white or blue. I was disappointed and I will not be ordering from the seller again because they didnt want to assist me in getting a replacement.
303,At this price I wish they would of included a lint free rag so I can wipe off old residue. Arctic silver 5 is a thing of the past. Noctua makes a better compound check them out.
304,"Unless you are a masochist, don't buy into the instability, failure and disappointment this external hard-drive will give you.  Despite the negative reviews I read here and at [...] because I had also read that ""yes, there was a production problem with this drive but that Seagate had remedied the problem"",  I felt it was safe enough to take a chance and went ahead and bought it.  What a mistake!  It worked fine for about two weeks, then I noticed that the drive would not kick in for about the first twenty minutes it was plugged in, then it progressively went from 20 minutes to 45minutes to an hour to two hours to half-a-day and then every other day.  Like most people I did not have the time and did not want to pay the postage back to Seagate ([...]) as well as lose the data I had on the drive (nearly 600GB) so I decided to live with it until last week when, after five days, it still had not kicked in.  I reluctantly called Seagate and I do have to give them points for fine customer service and relatively no-fuss replacement (which I have not received yet) - the only downpoint to the return process was having to essentially certify that I would not ship the hard drive to terrorist havens and countries of the infamous ""evil axis"" grouping.Interestingly enough the drive which had not kicked in for five days prior to me calling Seagate, kicked in five hours after that call and I was able to save most of the data on the 1tb drive.I did not want to buy a Seagate.  I had previously given a friend a 300GB Seagate external harddrive but after 3 months it had upped and died also.  I would have preferred to buy a Western Digital which I have always had safe, secure and stable experiences with.  I bought the Seagate because Company A had it on sale at a ridculously low price with no shipping charges.  It's almost a classic story - I went cheap and paid the price of getting cheaply made, inferior goods.  I don't know how the replacement will work out but I am fearful.  Western Digital has recently come out with a ""green"" internal 2TB harddrive and I think the next one I will buy will be that one.  I do know I will not buy or come near a Seagate product again.  An external hard-drive is supposed to be a stable and secure device for storing data not an unreliable and unstable device of which you stand a good chance of losing all your data.Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive ST310005FDA2E1-RK (Silver)"
305,"When the computer is connected with Ethernet cable to the router that is in turn connected with the Ethernet cable to the cable modem,  speed test shows only half of available speed.Tried upgrading the firmware and ordered a replacement unit. Same thing.Will attempt to return both and buy a known brand such as CISCO or Dlink."
306,"If I could give this company zero stars, I would.  The item had obviously been used, abused, broken and sold to me as ""new"".  The problems weren't apparent until I started to put the battery in.  It was very apparent that someone else had already opened it (pen marks on the open gate, welts on the plastic).When I connected the battery, it simply refused to turn on.  Big surprise.Unfortunately, I'm past the 30-day return window.  Hey, I'm a busy single parent with two kids, a job, etc, just like the many of you, and I didn't have time to get to it right away.I'll be contact the shipper directly and requesting a refund.  If none is forthcoming, I will be having my pre-paid lawyer get all over them.  I order a lot from Company A, and seriously 10% of everything is used, broken crap that gets pandered as ""new"".  I'm getting sick of it."
307,"This thing is a total joke, barely outputs 400watts before it cuts off. Cooler Master = cheap made in china third grade crap. Do yourself a favorite and spent $20 more for something better."
308,This did not work at all as described.  It certainly doesn't work with an iPad or IPhone.  It did come on time.
309,This mount is so poorly designed and constructed that the clamp that holds the iPod or iPhone broke off the arm before I finished installing it the first time.  Back it goes.
310,I needed a cable that was a meter long and this one is a yard. So don't buy if you are like me and needed a meter.
311,I've purchased the Jay bird BT headphone for running.Many reviews suggested to also buy this earbud (claiming the provided ones did not work well)Acoustibuds are horrible for me.... and for my surprise the Jay Bird provided ones are extremely good and deliver sound quality.Not for me...
312,"Bought this to carry along with my Macbook Air, it worked fine initially but now two of the 4 ports don't work! In effect it only adds one additional port the one that I already have on my Air (this still doubles my USB port capacity but is hardly what I was looking for)At the current price it's not even worth the hassle of following up with the manufacturer and sending back for service. I'd recommendthis Belkin Hubinstead."
313,"This battery doesn't work with my new Panasonic Lumix DMC-3G. The description say's is for ""Panasonic DMW-BLB13 Battery for Panasonic Company G Micro Four Thirds Cameras"" and is recommended in the ""Frequently Bought Together"" section.Why Company A sold this battery that doesn't fit in the camera? Tottaly disapointed."
314,"I'm not sure what this cable is supposed to work with. I bought it to connected the HDMI output of a non-copyprotected digital video recorder to the component input of our TV. I was never able to get the TV to recognize any signal from the DVR using this. Although I was warned in person and on a couple of AV forums that this wouldn't work, I thought it would be worth a try given the low cost. I hope the vendor adds a more detailed description in the future stating what types of HDMI products this cable can work with."
315,"This only worked correctly for a couple of days. After that, the modem would drop the internet every 2 minutes. I had just started new service so I thought it was the line. After a lot of phone time with the DSL provider, Actiontec customer service, and a phone technician visit, I bought a Netgear modem at Best Buy and my internet is back to working. When I called Acitiontec and told them what was happening, they immediately told me the problem was with my DSL line. They were wrong. I can't recommend this product at all."

317,Nice design; Loud feedback buzz on Macbook Pro.Brought the Bose instead (you get what you pay for)
318,"It worked perfectly. For 5 minutes. After that the unit refused to switch inputs unless I physically removed the cables for all the devices except the one I wanted to use (which defeats the whole point of having a switch).  Didn't matter if I used the remote or the physical button on the device to attempt to switch inputs. The device would light up for the input I wanted, then flicker back and forth between that one and the last one I was on, and then switch back to the previous device.Interestingly, when I ordered the Apogee, the pictures matched that of the device that ended up working for me:Cable Matters 3 Port 3x1 HDMI Switch with IR.  But the device I received looks identical to thePortta PET0301S 3x1 HDMI Switcher with 3D Supportwhich I also ordered.  With the exception of packing, the Apogee I received was the EXACT same device as the Portta, The Portta did not work out of the box and exhibited the exact same issue as this Apogee.The Cable Matters switch is, so far, the only device that has worked,"
319,"As some other reviews have mentioned, occasionally Company A will ship out what appears to be a cheap import version of this battery.  I have ordered 3 of the LP-E6 batteries prior to this order, and all 3 were the proper USA versions with serial number imprinted on the back of batteries.  This new one that I ordered, however, turned out to be the non-serial numbered type.  Needless to say, I returned it.  For the amount paid, I expect what I have received before.  A fully authentic Canon LP-E6 serial numbered battery, not some possible import or knockoff version.  Company A really should investigate the issues with this battery and provide a more detailed description to consumers to avoid any issues."

321,"You immediately note the flimsy construction of this device, but that wouldn't matter if it actually worked.  Unfortunately, after less than a year of very limited use, it just stopped functioning.  What's to wear out in a tester?  I replaced its own battery, to no avail.  It's just another cheap, shoddy product from our big friend across the Pacific.  Don't waste your time & money on it."

323,"The seller of this item is A1.  When I complained about the problem in the image, he sent me another straight away and didn't ask that the first be returned.  Unfortunately, the second has the exact same problem as the first:  there is a paisley-like background pattern that you can see against any dark parts of the image.  It must be something in the CCD chip design.  I should have heeded all the other one * ratings.  If you don't care much about the image, you may not notice the paisley pattern.  If you are always high when you do video conferences, you might like it! :) I might keep it for use as a bar-code scanner, since the manual focus can be adjusted to see very sharply 0 mm! (yes, even negative)  A 3mm by 5mm square fills the screen with perfect focus!  Yes, really!  If you need a video camera to take pictures of an ant, this will work.  But you will sea the darn paisley pattern over dark areas!But be careful with the built-in LED video lights.  When I was adjusting their brightness, my MacBook Pro didn't like what was happening to its USB port and had a kernel panic."
324,"UPDATE: After two months of hard work, this charger is deceased. It is no more. It is not living! The worst part: The indicator light still glows green like it is working and charging perfectly. This gave me the false impression that something had gone horribly wrong with my laptop. I ordered a replacement DC jack and changed it out -- no difference. Still would not power up. Got a new PWR+ brand charger and works perfectly. If you need a new charger for your Vaio - GO WITH PWR+! It's only a few dollars more and well worth it. Avoid this cheap crap!Sony wanted over $100 for their charger -- not happening. This cost ten bucks and came via Prime in two days. It works just the same as the original charger; it even stays cooler than the original.My biggest qualm was with the a/c cord. It would easily fall out of the outlet with the slightest bit of movement. I took my power cord from the original charger and used it with this one. Works great now. So...half of this product is good!"
325,"Charger burned my leg when it touched it (enough to leave a mark for a few days). Have had this for 2 months, and it blew out. This product should be recalled!"
326,"Unstable, unstable, did I say unstable? Went to mfg website, installed firmware update. Still unstable. maybe if you install DDWRT or Tomato it will work fine, not sure. Netgear has reputation for good h/w, so if you can get s/w stable should be good unit."
327,The attached wallet that stores the gels and the window that holds the gels in front of the flash are smaller than the gel. So when I throw it into my bag the ends of the gels get banged around. Pretty lame and too expensive to boot.

329,"After searching for a 12 volt portable DVD player this item showed up. It even suggested buying a car adapter from the same company. Upon opening the package found that this unit does not have the capability to run on 12 volt. We wanted something to use with our portable 12 volt TV as we camp in a remote part of Maine. Just wanted something for rainy days without having to run the generator. I was mislead and had to pay for the return shipping. Lesson learned, double check before ordering."
330,I was really excited to get the Cowon S9.  The menu's are confusing at times but not that hard to get use too.  The screen is very good and is pretty responsive.  I'm not sure if I got a bad player but I have a huge issue with the USB connection...  Sense the USB cable does not securely lock into the player it will not work in my car for one.  It is hard to get the S9 to stay connected to charge or connect to the computer.  The S9 restarts after the USB cable is disconnected from the player not sure why it does that.....  The USB CONNECTION PROBLEM was a total deal breaker for me yes it looks amazing and the sound quality is the best I have ever heard but a mp3 player becomes useless if you cannot charge it or put more music on it.
331,"I really wanted to like this unit, it had everything I was looking for, except one thing...a working radio. There is one station that comes in clear, every other one is interrupted every 10 seconds by static. The HD fades in an out constantly and when it cuts out it takes 5 seconds or more to come back on. Often it will play both the HD and the regular signal so you get a weird echo effect. I live in Atlanta, a major metropolitan area, there is no reason I shouldn't be able to get most stations clearly. I can deal with the cheap buttons, I can deal with not having a usb in the back, but I can't deal with a radio that works as everything but...a radio. Totally worthless. I'm sending this back."
332,My power supply cable was bad.  I don't even know how you can mess that up these days. That takes some seriously bad manufacturing to achieve. The power supply box itself makes a terrible whining noise when plugged in. I don't trust to plug anything into it given the other reviews of drives being destroyed.
333,"First off, my previous camera was a Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 and it was excellent, I never had a single problem. This camera is the complete opposite. I bought my first, which came defective and would never focus. I returned it and got a replacement, which had the same problem. It made a loud clicking noise, clearly something wrong, but would rarely focus correctly. I even took it to a professional camera store, and they without hesitation said it was defective. Of the few pictures it actually focused on, the quality was less than perfect. My EX-Z1000 (over two years old) continued to take better pictures. Casio's once quality line-up of cameras is no more. Don't waste your money.Sony's DSC-W290, which is nearly identical in specs to this, and has the same price is the better choice."
334,"I did not expect top quality audio here, just expected it to function.  Even something that's really cheap should still work, right?"
335,"I needed a keyboard to use with a laptop that I use on a table top frequently - but I prefer to type below the desk level thus the need for a keyboard with a built in mouse/touchpad.  The major issues I had were the number keys are offset about 1/4"" to the right making this extremely uncomfortable for a touch typist.  I don't understand why they did this as the keyboard is full size.  The second issue that I could not live with is the inability to turn off the tapping feature of the touchpad.  I read on Adesso's site that there was a driver that could be downloaded for a touchpad/keyboard (not sure if it was for this Adesso keyboard), but that you'd have to uninstall your laptops touchpad - this was out of the question for me as I use the laptop also as a laptop when not on the desk.  The keyboard itself seems well built, but the above two issues made in completely awful for me."
336,"First the good news. It is very easy to set up, they even include a screw driver to put it together.It works great as a USB drive.Now the bad.I bought this specifically to use as an ESATA drive and it does not work as an ESATA drive. This is my seconds ESATA drive and my other one works perfectly.So if you are looking for a case to use as an external USB drive then go for it. But is you are looking for an ESATA drive keep looking..."
337,So you've lost a couple of lens caps and think this might solve the problem. Think again.The cap keeper elastic snapped the first time I tried to use it. Worthless.
338,"The cable looks good when it arrives, but the picture quality provided says it all!  'You should have saved the $3 instead!"""
339,"I bought the Linksys Wireless Internet Bridge to connect a Slingbox to my wireless router. (The Slingbox was designed to work with an Ethernet connection. Slinglink didn't work because my TIVO, and therefore the Slingbox, is in a different room and on a different electrical circuit than the router. Slinglink connects to the router using your home's electrical wiring.) After spending two hours on the phone with Linksys tech support (he did try patiently and hard), I gave up when the Linksys technician wanted to transfer me to another tech because he thought that the problem was with my AT&T 2Wire router's settings. I was later able to connect a HAVA wirelessly to my router. See my review of the HAVA Titanium HD TV HiFi device."
340,Nice but did not last! I got this for my son for Christmas for his truck. I had it proffesionally installed. It has been 6 weeks since it was installed and the screen has went white. I have contacted Company A and will get in touch with Boss tomorrow. This thing was on sale for $300. Thought I got a deal. Guess not. Even if they do replace it I will have to have it unistalled and reinstalled. Would have been better off buying a stereo from a pro audio place.
341,"My drive started to make a loud ""clunk"" sound about a week after I installed it.  I just spoke with Seagate warranty department and they said that it would cost me $19.95 to have them ship me a new drive under warranty.  The warranty rep said that neither he nor his managers have the authority to waive this fee. It'll cost me nothing to return it to the retailer as defective, so I'll do that today instead.Edited to add:The replacement drive is now making the ""clunk"" sound as well and needs to be replaced.  This time, I'll go with a brand other than Seagate.Warranty experience:  The second failed drive was shipped to Seagate eleven days ago and they still show my claim as ""not recieved"".  According to my delivery confirmation query, USPS delivered it to their location right on the border of Mexico and Texas, so I assume that Seagate then ships it to some warehouse in Mexico where the recieving process is SLOWLY completed.  Speaking with Seagate's stern warranty reps was interesting:  If you use bubble wrap or packing peanuts when you ship the drive, they will void the warranty!  Seagate offers a .pdf file with very strict shipping instructions, including a specific 2-inch thick foam that you must use for packaging.  I wonder how many warranty claims Seagate invalidates for failure to meet their unusually weird shipping instructions.In the meantime, I installed a 500GB Hitachi drive that runs perfectly.  No more clunking and my notebook no longer vibrates like a blender.  The Hitachi drive is completely silent, fast, and runs much colder than the Seagate clunker."
342,in  shortgoodnothingBADone channel was brokencustomer support (as soon as i removed my review they forgot about me)made my car have a current drawwhich killed my batteryand the speakers buzzed
343,"After a year the left channel got stuck at mid volume. The volume knob only affects the right channel. It is not the cable or sound chip - other speakers work fine.I have resorted to turning up the volume with the speaker volume knob so the left and right are fairly balanced, then only changing volume through the computer. If I want something louder than that then tough for me I guess.Speakers aren't expected to do much so at $70 for the pair this is pretty shoddy."
344,Item that the warranty was to cover was down sized.... No instruction on how to return the warranty.. Hence warranty not needed
345,I did not like this cover at all and I sent it back and got a different one.  The strap was a total pain and got in the way.
346,I bought this unit in April 2010 and it broke from only light use in July 2010. The CD cover will no longer stay down and I have to use a heavy weight to play any CD's. Since it is beyond the 90 day warranty my only option is to return it to Company A for a 50% refund. Don't waste your money on this player. It is very delicate and easily broken.
347,"$1 a piece plus shipping! For such a good product, one can only imagine how far many more would be sold if they were more reasonably priced. And the fact that Company A doesn't carry them themselves--meaning I have to pay another $5 for shipping from Cyberguys--means they end up not being worth the expense. Better to buy slim DVD cases for 20 cents."
348,"This D10 seemed to work as advertised for a short while.  While taking pictures indoors in a benign environment, I got ""lens error, please restart""  I've tried for several hours restarting and removing & replacing the battery to get the camera to work again without success.  The camera has NOT been abused but is apparently much more fragile than Canon will admit.  DO NOT BUY THIS PAPERWEIGHT!"
349,"I have had this drive for about a week and it has started to click when my system boots. Windows cannot find any problems with the drive, but I have to wonder how long it is going to last. I may have to take advantage of 2 year warranty, but for now I have to be very careful about backing up the drive contents."
350,"The backdrop is very thin, almost see-through, and likely won't survive a washing. Also, except for a couple of inches along the top and bottom fringes (which will never be seen in a photo), a very light sky-blue mixed with white pattern; not remotely similar to what is pictured."
351,"I bought this flash drive so I could load my MP3 files onto it and play them via Sync (OS software developed by Microsoft) in my Ford Flex.  I already have 8GB and 16GB Sandisk flash drives that work fine with Sync, but for some reason the 32GB Sandisk flash drive is not recognized by Sync at all (even after reformatting to FAT32, and removing U3).  This is strange because Sync is very capable of working with flash drives much larger than 32GB (it can even handle portable hard drives).  After I had this trouble I checked Ford's web site and discovered that I'm not the only person having trouble getting the 32GB Sandisk Cruzer in particular to work with Sync.  That tells me there is something unique about this drive (maybe the fact that it was designed for U3?).  I returned the Sandisk flash drive, and plan to purchase another brand instead.This flash drive seemed to work ok for storing files, but it doesn't work for the purpose for which I purchased it.  Therefore I can't give it a good rating.Update: I bought a Lexar JumpDrive TwistTurn 32GB Flash Drive.  It works great with Ford's Sync system.  No formatting or other extra work required!"
352,Do not buy this product.I bought two of these memory card readers for my sister and I.It does not work on any Mac or PC that we have (2005 - 2010) It did not work on 8 of my friends computers either.This memory card reader Sucks.ZERO STARS.
353,this product did not come to my satisfaction i had to pay for return 9.00 took out of my account
354,"This case was purchased along with a Nikon Coolpix L22 camera, and it was advertised as a case made to fit that specific camera. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Although the quality and construction of this camera case is very good, it is much too small to fit the Nikon Coolpix camera. The camera could be forced into the case, but it fits so tightly, that removal is a lengthy process. Because of the relatively small cost of the case, I chose not to return it, as I would have had to pay return postage. I just scratched it up as a small loss. I feel that the people at Company A did not do proper research on this item, and just relied on the seller's description, that turned out to be wrong."
355,"Like several other people I liked these for the first few days, after which the headphones button stopped working: first I wasn't able to turn them off and now they won't come on either. I, too, wonder if sweat is the culprit."
356,Initially I was very impressed with the player - good looks and small for what you get. Hooked it up - downloaded the update and started watching a DVD - Froze 30 min into the movie - thought it was a fluke and reset the player. Resumed from where i left off and 1 hour later it did it again. Reset and finished the movie. Started watching a movie from netflix streaming and it froze again. reset and finished watching. went to eat dinner and later that night went to try to watch something from netflix again and it won't turn on. all i get is a pixelated image that is displayed when it turns on and the speakers blip and the image comes back again - it will not turn on at all - it's stuck booting up.I read the 30+ 1 star reviews warning me not to get this player - I took a chance and wish i hadn't spent my time with all this. Just filled out the return info for this player and ordered the LG 390 player to replace it - hopefully they know how to make a better quality player...DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!
357,Went through about six of these trying to burn with my unibody MacBook Pro.  Finally sent them back and got a refund.  Bought some Memorex DL DVDs at Target and they burned just fine.  Wish they worked for me because the price unbeatable!
358,"This really should be 0 stars.  Flash worked for about 15 pictures, then wouldn't work the next time I pulled it out and tried it, I tried new batteries and everything else I could think of, the test flash wouldn't even fire.  Tried to contact customer service at vivtar, that was a joke, you are most likely on your own if you buy this flash and it malfunctions.  Luckily it failed so quickly I was still able to return it and get a better brand with all the same features for $100 more, i got a sigma flash im very pleased with it, it's much better quality."
359,"**edit** after using this product for no more than 5 times,it suddenly died trying to charge an iphone 3g.not worth the money at all.based on other people's horror stories, i was hoping thiswould be able to charge my gps at home so that i can turnit on and preprogram the next day's route."
360,I got this hood because you can very the depth of the hood to fit your need and zoom but even with the hood pulled back to the shallowest level I get vignetting on my pictures. I'm using a canon EOS T3 with my standard 18-55mm kit len and wanted to stop the purple flaring I get in some lighting conditions and this provide a solution to that but the corners of my pictures would always be cut off when I took pictures at the widest angle shot.
361,"This was a disappointment. I didn't want to believe any of the bad reviews on this item. I had high hopes and thought at very least it would help stations come in a little bit better, but it has done the opposite... more static. A waste of ten dollars."
362,"I received the Sony BDP-S360 player in mid-February and used it for both Blu-ray and regular DVD discs.  The picture quality is OK, but disc loading time is glacially slow.  Given the relatively low price I paid for the player, I could live with the slowness.  What I can't live with is that the player failed by the end of June, four and a half months after I received it.  The tray no longer will open and all I get is a message saying ""D ERROR.""  The ""D"" stands for disc, but also stands for ""DON'T BUY."""
363,"I purchased 4 of these cameras in the summer of 2012. They all worked for a while. Suddenly, in July of 1013 3 of the 4 cameras simply quit working with no warning. I am now left with one of the original cameras and have no idea when it will cease to function. Having said that, I am not too confident of it lasting much longer based on how soon the three identical companion cameras simply died. Do not purchase this product.When I reported this issue to the vendor this was their response:""We offer 30 days return, replacement and 90 days repair warranty, since your item was purchased more than 30 days ago, so we are not able to do the return for you any more.Best regardsCustomer service"""
364,"Was kinda suprised that microsoft put this out.I spent a little extra to get a brand for my son so he wasnt walking around with a sanyo or other cheap brand electronic company- the box came busted up, but thats fine, i dont need the box.the item came refurbished, completely dead.it was made of a hard plsatic material , and with very little weight it felt incredibly cheap. like bad cheap, one of those things you feel like you will snap in your pocket cheap.can play video, but screen is a little to small IRL to enjoy it. the headphones were okay.Sadly i think i would of just bought a cheap-o if I realized this was the quality I was getting :("
365,"special offer for nikon p310 and canon sx260, but when the case is arrived, it's hard to fit for both. be careful before you order it."
366,"Speakers ruptured within two weeks of use. Worthless construction and poor sound quality, noise-isolating feature is a fancy word for rubber plugs."
367,"I bought a Crosley for my daughter from Company A and the phono cartridge was mounted crooked on the tonearm. It had a &#34;list&#34; to it which caused the plastic housing of the cartridge to rub against the record while it was playing which, of course, caused problems (skipping, etc). So Company A accepted the return for credit and I bought another one locally. The new one had the cartridge mounted straight enough, but it had a serious warble to the sound. Not sure if it was a bad belt or a bad motor. All that and the mediocre sound overall means it went back as well. These things are basically junk products."
368,"I used this battery as an emergency backup.  In the past, I had no problem, however today I used at an airshow, and the battery power ran completely out.  Not a problem in itself (although there is NO warning, since it doesn't communicate).  I was shooting HD video when the power apparently ended, and the screen of my $2600 MK2 went blank, and the mirror appeared to stay up.  I popped the battery out, popped in a genuine battery that had a very little juice left in it, and the mirror (or something) clicked down, and the camera came on.After re-charging my genuine battery at a nearby newscrew's stand, I shot the rest of the show with a genuine battery.WHEN I GOT HOME, ALL PICTURES AND VIDEO SHOT DURING AND PRIOR TO THE GENERIC BATTERY HAD BEEN ERASED/CORRUPTED!!!!  The entire first half of the airshow was gone from my card!Needless to say, a bad day, but the greater cause for concern is of course the camera.  I will NEVER use a non-canon battery in my camera again.  I am purchasing two more just to have genuine charged backups on hand.  You spent over $4000 on a camera and lenses.  Don't screw it up over the price of a couple Canon batteries."
369,"I had to return it .Frist it would not stay plugged in to my lap top unless I held it in .Second ,It ran very very hot ,it was so hot I thought it may over heat and cause a fire .There was no way I was no way I was going to keep it after it got that HOT ."
370,Indoor install.  Cut myself twice on the super sharp edges of the unfinished material. I get a signal for some channels and I'm constantly re-adjusting this. Now it's junk in the garage.
371,"Who wouldn't want a gazillion foamies for a few bucks?  Anyone wanting to put these on Apple's standard headsets! (original round ones - not the newer earpods, though that seems even less probable).1 star for price, 0 for fit.  They rip trying to get them on or get stretched too thin when you get them on and don't last long (in/out of pockets, purses, car cubbies, etc) before ripping or just disappearing."
372,"I connected this 2 wire ATT modem with the help of ATT Tech.  It ran great for about 20 mins then all hell broke loose.  It kept dropping my connection to the net.  Then my Norton 360 started running errors.  I got errors that I don't even know what they were.  I called ATT for help, they couldnt not help me with this modem.I finally disconnected this modem.  Reconnected my Old Model and restored my service to an earlier date and time.The better part of this morning was completely lost trying to get my internet service back on line.  I reallydont appreciate you selling defective merchanise.  Give me your address and I will return this crap also send me the 5.95 for postage"
373,"I am unable to recommend this player.  I returned mine to the seller.The unit I received had a weird, sporadic, picture distortion defect that came and went.  I assume this was merely a defective unit, and not evidence of a design flaw that, for example, permitted interference from other electronic devices in the vicinity.What really disappointed me was the extraordinarily poor user interface.  When you stop playback, for instance, it does not bring you back to the disc or usb device contents listing, you actually have to push yet another button to get the listing.  You have to do this all the time.If you have media which has both video and audio files on it, you cannot see both listed at the same time, the device forces you to choose ""divx"" for video or ""mp3"" for audio, after which the contents listing shows only the one or the other, but not both.  Can't imagine why on earth Pioneer designed it that way.You get no help at all if you have a CD loaded up with 100-200 mp3s, particularly if the file names are longer than about 14 characters.  If you name a file, as I do, according to the format ""artist album tracknumber trackname.mp3"", this player will produce a contents listing where every single file looks the same.  Worse, it does not number the files, so even if you have your own guide, you cannot find the file you want to play.  Worse, the player's ""display"" button does not work at all during mp3 playback, to display the full name of the file, as my old Philips did.  So, despite having mp3 playback capability, in fact the unit is useless for that.These dvd players lately all seem to suffer from really poor user interfaces (not to mention the poor-designed remotes.)  I have yet to discover a DVD player with any elegance to its user interface, or that reflects a real understanding on the part of the manufacturer as to how the player is actually used."
374,"This little guy is cute, but not reliable. Even very low-demanding devices stop working and certain ""limbs"" give out. Do not bother."
375,"This thing is absolute junk. I love dd-wrt and use it on some other devices for years. So i though i'd get this and use it with my gigabits/n wireless network at home. Was i ever wrong about that.Setup/looks and everything about this thing is fine. It looks great, works as intended during setup.And then after hour or so of use it started loosing connection. All the sudden i would just not be able to go on the web and my Att Microcell lost signal.At first i thought maybe something is setup wrong so i re-checked all the settings.. and mind you i am an advanced user with 10 years of IT/Networking experience.Anyway, basically after testing it for 24 hours and it going down every couple of hours, i am returning it as defective product.DO NOT get this item. I realize that there are some people that say its working great for them but there are plenty of people like me that were not able to have it work out and that should be a red flag. I have one linksys router that is running dd-wrt and has been up for almost 2 years without having any problems. DD-WRT rocks, this thing does not!"
376,"I was pleasantly surprised by how small this camera was, but greatly dismayed by the sound quality (or lack thereof).  Even in a silent room with the camera stationary, the sound recording is full of loud static.  I'm not sure if this is normal for this camera, but it makes it completely unusable.  I saw some sample videos in the reviews of this camera and figured the static was from wind/action...but no, the static is always there.  They would have been better off to not have included sound at all, that's how useless it is.  I wasn't expecting great sound from this little camera, but I was at least expecting it to somewhat cleanly record sound, but this doesn't even approach any standard of usable audio.  Maybe I got a defective unit?  I don't know, but if that's how all these cameras are, stay away unless you want to turn the sound off on your computer when watching any videos or plan to edit out the audio track later."
377,"The machine came with a certificate for Windows 7, which arrived after a phone call inquiring as to its whereabouts.In the middle of the install which required the optical drive, the optical drive disappeared and the install was unable to continue.Tech support promised to install Windows 7 if the machine was sent to them (at my expense - $50) but returned it with the old Vista reloaded.I am using this machine but cancelled the orders for the remaining 10 units and have told my people to never purchase an ACER product again.Followup - 2 years later - This has proven to be a reliable unit, disappointing that it has to run with Vista.  There is no Bluetooth, and the CD eject tray is insensitive most of the time.  However, it is light and the battery lasts long.The engineering is adequate.The support is abysmal.The superb workmanship is the only thing keeping this together.  Too bad Acer cancelled the line."
378,"tried to cancel 5 minutes after placed because i had ordered another that did not have audio out.i don't know why my cancellation was completely disregarded.the unit itself works ok. however the cords and cables are way too shot and are proprietary.same with the charging cable that charges your iPod,iPad... it too has a proprietary usb connection.the charging port on the unit itself is however a standard usb. they should have done the same with the adapter which fits on the iPod/ipad.if you loose that usb (which hooks into the connector that sits on the iPad) you will have to buy another from them.only the charger for the unit itself is standard usb. all other connections as such are proprietary.UPADTE 03-26-12unit stopped working after about a month. i just ordered the Cinemin Swap so i could hook my mac to it via vga but the thing stopped working.have sent email to vendor, lets see what they say."
379,"Totally bummed at this.. If someone has had better luck, good on ya.I've owned one of these devices that was about the same price, but the clarity was incomparable. Unfortunately this was not one of them. I wish I could remember the brand name of the one I used to own, but it had a weird way to plug into the power outlet...Do not buy this if you have another option, but again, I may have been sent a bad version, but just be warned.. (and yes, it was brand new when I received it with the plastic display coverings)It does charge de iPod though.. which is the only reason I haven't thrown it in the trash.If you do not find this review helpful, please comment as to why. Thank you!"
380,Talk about overpriced. This is an item that should have come with the camera in the first place. I'd rather pay for another battery (half the price) than buy this thing. Thankfully I can just plug my memory card directly into my computer to save power.
381,"This adapter initially worked perfectly. But within the first week, my laptop began to sporadically lose connection with the external monitor. Within three weeks, it did not work at all. I tried a different DVI cable and monitor, and I changed some video setting with no improvement. Which meant this adapter was the culprit. I ordered a more expensive adapter (DP2DVI from [...]) and it works perfectly."
382,"I purchased this Seagate Black Armor 1 TB Back UP storage drive because it was rated Business Grade and had good web reviews.  It cost more than other 1TB drives from Seagate and most others.It failed in less than two weeks.  Seagate Tech support (since it was within the 30day limit) was good on the phone and diagnosed it.  They had me also test it on another computer which immediately said I had connected a defective USB drive.So the Tech Support wizard gave me a case number and sent me to Warrantee Returns.Another frustration in time wasting.  Finally I got a person, since the web return pages dissavowed my serial number.  We finally got the RA number and shipping after I promised not to use their devices for Nuclear or Terrorism.I will pay to ship it back and they will send me a replacement.  Probably another refurbished short lived piece of frustration.I have many Seagate and Maxtor drives.  Maybe I will seek another supplier.Avoid them if you can but it is hard to ignore the giant.But eventually General Motors was ignored and Chrysler who?Mechanical Engineer, MBA, retired small company CEO."
383,"Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5 EX DC HSM ELD SLD Aspherical Super Wide Angle Lens for Canon Digital SLR CamerasAn unsatisfying experience! The lens does not focus smoothly but with audible ""jerks"". Clarity is missing from photos taken with this lens. The only time something comes out reasonably sharp is when it's large and right in front of the lens. Objects behind and to the sides of this object are increasingly fuzzy the farther they are from it. Lack of clarity does not depend on whether an object is near the center or near the periphery of the photo -- it does seem to depend on how far it is from the camera.Landscapes have nothing dependably in focus -- where the auto focus points flash may or may not be sharp although typically not. I used single center and all 9 focusing points and the results were the same.Earlier this year I took several hundred photos with the Canon 10-22mm (on my 450D body) -- it's an easy lens to use, it was a fun experience and the picures were what you would expect from a good lens. Using this Sigma lens is frustrating with poor results. A waste of time and money."
384,"I initially gave these a good review, but after several years of owning 7 of them, I've had to repair 5 and sold them all on ebay.  I almost felt guilty selling them to an unknowing buyer.I ran these between two drobos for the past 3 years.  The green drives from both Hitachi and Western Digital have performed well in my RAIDS, but the 7200rpm Hitachis have just died one after the other at random.Also, these drives are excessively noisy and hot, and will cause your computer or external enclosure's fan to run at max and add to the noise.If you need high performance, its better to get an enterprise class drive, not a cheepo 7200.  It seems that in the high capacity cheap drives have a high failure rate.  The green drives that are less expensive are also very reliable."
385,Update.. I got a replacement pair and guess what.. they broke also in the same way.. total crap..Had these for two weeks before they broke. There was sound (very low) coming out of one ear. I had to return for an exchange. When they worked the sound was pretty good.
386,it broke down twice. 5 * for MSFT for replacing it twice. 0 * for prod reliability. I replaced it with logitech m315
387,ITEM IS A FAKE! Confirmed by Kingston.Worse yet I was sent a 256g version when ordering a 128g. Kingston does not make a 256g version
388,"Product stinks! On/off switch malfunctioned after first use, no response from distribtor, who incidently promised 24 hour response to inquiries. Avoid product from this distributor."
389,"This is partly my fault for not reading the description fully, but when you check the box on the left side for &#34;SATA&#34; you expect that only SATA drives will pop up.  That's $19 down the drain..."
390,"I don't know if maybe this kinda sound quality was top of the line in headsets back in 2009, but if it was then the megaladon has not aged well. Not well at all.The quality of the sound compares to that of a $15 pair of KOSS earbuds you can find at walmart these days, in stereo and surround sound mode. The volume on them can't be cranked at ALL, and things have that opera hall effect to them when you enable the surround sound mode.It's really sad considering these things look, feel, and come packaged made to impress! However they simply do not perform in any way compared to other headsets in the $120-140 range atm.If you currently think these are good in any way shape or form, then try out a pair of Logitech G930's or a Turtle Beach DPX21 and prepare to have your world turned upside down, because your old opinions of good and bad sound quality ina headset will never be the same again.P.S.This is not an exaggeration, this headsets sound quality is just horrible for what you'd expect and pay for. Try em out and see for yourselves if you must, and once you do, write here just like I have about how you felt after using them."
391,"The product took me several times to install.  I had to install/reboot/remove/install/reboot several times before it would work. When I displayed an Internet Explorer window, scrolling was extremely slow.  I removed the product and software and returned it to Company A. Something I found out was there was NO customer support.  The CD had the drivers and a file that had pictures of the parts. There was no program to adjust the color or window size built into the product like Invidea or any other manufacturer has with their products. There was NO product support, email or phone number.  If it doesn't work or you have a problem with it of any sorts, you're out of luck. I would not recommend this product."
392,Avoid these.. They do not work in the USB or to charge.. Waste of money! PLEASE do not buy these!
393,"Sure, it's cheap, but it's also a piece of crap.It can't even handle my keyboard/mouse with two of the four slots open.  Granted, they only become inoperable after my computer goes to sleep and wakes up again, and if I unplug the splitter and plug it back in it works after that.  But, my OS has to recognize the damn thing every single time and I'd rather just unplug another device I have plugged into a USB port to make room for another; it beats using this thing.  Spend a little more and get a splitter that works...the number of 1 star ratings tell it all; don't make the same mistake I did by ignoring them."
394,"Very cheaply made. No AC adaptor comes with it, effectively making it useless. If you 'overload' this strip with too many USB devices requiring power over USB, you will blow your USB port on your computer.Beware."
395,"If you want to use this device for USB 1.0 products, and not for charging, it will probably be worth the price.  It only has 2 amps total to distribute between all 7 ports, so when connected devices require more than 2 amps total, this hub starts failing.  Pretty much every device out there requires at least one amp to charge, so you can do the math.Windows 7 will also report that the hub is not USB2.0 compliant, so don't expect fast transfers to HDD's and the like.  Live and learn.I'm going to buy a name brand hub with at least 1 amp for each port, and one guaranteed for USB2.0 speed."
396,"Checked these out at a TJ-Maxx. They were in a 'Xmas trinket for guyd' area... They still say porro prism and have none at all, still have all-plastic Galilean optics, still have far lower power than promised. And...they were 10 bucks. With shipping from Company A, same shaky deal.  I agree with the other reviewer: for 10 dollars, the little Tasco binocs (Company A, Wal-MArt, etc) and the Bushnell units (even higher avg ratings) are vastly better than this toy.  For toy binocs that are actually sharper than this for $5, they sometimes have those in a bin at Walgreen's. I even got a pair with coated glass up front. Much sharper. Kind of a shame on these: the mechanicals are smooth enough. A little glass (an extra buck or two?) and a tad more real power would make these fine opera glasses."
397,"Unfortunately I wasn't sane and did buy it a couple months ago.  It does not work. It never worked. I've gone bk and forth with Samsung in an endless circle.  I bought their great tv and then decided to add this EXPENSIVE piece of garbage to it.  I might as well have taken $700 and opened my toilet lid, throw it in there, and click the handle and watch it twirl down the drain.The sound is pretty crappy.  It overheats (or not) and shuts off after 10 mins, or 20 mins, or 40 mins..  It always shuts off but randomly picks when it will shut off.  The DVD player door will not open.The thing is just a VERY INSANELY expensive piece of junk with poor sound quality and a complete rip off by the company.  I am livid beyond words.."
398,"I ordered this Last Feb 12, on  A gold Deal for $19.77 (Reduced from originally from $49.72)Now I see it selling for $27.99.I Now realize that The Sharp drop in Price its Because this HeadFones is NOT WORTH the Money.I dont know what Drugs the Earlier Reviewers (from 2010) Posted abut Rich BASS, But this Thing Has almost NONE....or very Little bass (if any). I Bought a Sports Philips SHQ4000/28 Neckband Headphones for $14.00 and this has Much more BASS than this.I am Glad a Few Recent Reviewers have stated this (in the last set of Posts before Mine) So I know I am Not being Too Negatively Judgmental.Some How I believe the Components use in this are Not the same as they were in 2010, where the First set of posters set it had Rich BASS.The Only thing God can Say about this is that the Plug is Gold plated. and the Sound is very Clear (A lot of HIGH but really Little or No BASS.

I decided to Accept this because I Wanted a Good Sounding Headset. I deeply regret this decision now.Another Thing was the POOR Shipping, I order this since Feb 12, and Only today I got it.

399,"Im not really saying this mic is terrible, but Im saying my experience suggest either the mic is not as good as it could be, and definitely not as good as some of the reviews suggest, or there is a very inconsistent quality control.I ordered two of these, several reviews suggested the mic would be quite OK, how bad could they really be.. on testing the mic I inserted fresh batteries *not the included generic battery which might be half dead on arrival.  I compared these side by side with a couple of other shot-gun mics I have on hand for used with dSLR video capture.  BOTH of the units I received from Company A have a very high noise-leve, or more accurately a very low signal to noise level, meaning lots of background white-noise with little sound, this would not sound quite nice on a video.Some of the reviews point to poor shielding, surely that could cause this.  Regardless, the amount of noise in the unit with fresh batteries is unacceptable for anything really, Im returning the two microphones I purchased.Again, this is not a ""dig"" at Audio Technica whom I know to make great microphones, Im only saying that the two units I received was not performing as one could wish for, I do have about 20+ years with professional video recording and have a pretty good feeling how these should sound out of the box."
400,"We still have these piles of dung at work due to the company being to cheap to replace them.  They are slow as all hell, take forever to boot, can't run video or control programs to save it's life and has trouble loading IE explorer and Outlook every single time.  They were just serviced!!!  Midnight=junk."
401,i never received the item. will not purchase form this seller ever again. save your money and buy from someone else. frequent purchaser on this website and never have i been so disappointed. there's a 1st time for everything i suppose. be careful who you purchase from.
402,"Cable doesn't charge my HTC Droid Incredible.  It just turns the ""charging"" light on but never charges the battery."
403,"I've only had this mouse a week or so but using it 10 hours a day I already have a pretty good sense for it. I cannot yet comment on battery life or charging issues, but after some initial use I did charge it overnight once. We'll see where that leads. Will update later on that.Pros:* Very nice ergonomics if you have larger hands or longer fingers. If you have smallish hands it might be a little awkward for you, depending on what your preference is (small mouse or large mouse). The thumb rest is very comfortable and uses a nice material that has a slight tackyness to it but is still smooth for movement. Pressing the thumbrest area activates a button that can be used with Expose, which is nice for window management.The other Buttons work great, have just the right amount of ""click"" (less noisy than Mac mouse). Having a real right mouse button is a real treat! Speeds up my workflow considerably when browsing, working in Adobe apps, etc. Scroll wheel and buttons work fine, side-scrolling with wheel is a little awkward because you expect some sort of resistance feedback or click and there is none... you just have to put a little side pressure on it and it scrolls.* Up-to-date and reliable software. Unlike Kensington which uses 2006 driver software that is never updated, and which on OS 10.6 requires you to launch, quit and then re-launch the Preferences panel every time you use it, the Logitech drivers are updated fairly regularly and work well with the latest version of OS X. Plenty of customization options for each button. The only thing that's a little wonky is the DPI settings. By default it uses a 1000 dpi setting I believe but you have to assign the DPI setting to a button (I use the wheel press) to set a secondary option (for me I have done OK with 700 dpi, not quite as sensitive to every slight movement).* Darkfield laser works great! I have a black laminate desktop which rendered Kenginton's laser mouse totally useless after about 5 seconds of movement... the laser would lose track and shut off / reset. I'd have to constantly pick up the mouse and put it back down, to the point that I stopped using it after about a half hour of fiddling with it. Logitech Darkfield has worked flawlessly from the start and I've not had a single hiccup with same, even running the mouse over scratches or the crevice created by the two sections of the desk doesn't cause problems.* Unifying widget installs easily on side of my keyboard and works right away.* Other: comes with a nice carrying kit for cables, Unifying widget, etc.Cons:* None significant so far, except that the documentation that ships with the mouse is pretty weak. Not that you need an engineering degree to use a mouse but there are enough features and accessories that it would be good to have a little more info / a reference on when and how to use those for first time users.In short, this is the nicest mouse I've owned and is far better than Apple's default mouse options or the Kensington mice I've tried. Works seamlessly for browsing, creative computing, and seems decent for games though I am far from a gaming mouse expert.UPDATE:The Battery life on this mouse is mediocre. If you use it 9-10 hours a day and forget to turn it off a couple nights during the week (easy to do if you've never had to turn a mouse off before), a full charge will go about 10 days. If you are good about remembering to turn it off, maybe a few days longer.UPDATE 2:The Mousewheel has now begun to malfunction, which was my initial fear. I used it all the time in browsing and already it seems to be ""off track"", where I have to move it a lot to get a little bit of scrolling. Prefs are set correctly (I checked twice), so a disappointment for this amount of money IMO. Everything else still works well but scrolling is pretty darn important.UPDATE 3: A little over 2 years has past since purchasing this mouse and the left mouse button is now non-functional approximately 50% of the time. I see the same Left Button problems other people have complained about with Logitech mice, and an additional problem. My mouse will often ""lose a grip"" when I click-and-drag on an item, this results in dropping the item where I don't intend and clicking / creating a double-click on other areas I also do not intend, requiring me (within apps like Photoshop or C4D) to constantly undo steps I do not intend to make, because the mouse is not actually clicking-and-dragging when I perform that operation. Luckily still under warranty and I have issued a request for a replacement. So far no word on whether that has been approved. Reducing to 2 Stars. If they don't replace, 1 star. A good mouse should last several years, not two.UPDATE 4: Logitech has decided to send me a replacement so I'll leave the rating at 2 stars. Eventually the new one will probably suffer the same fate based on my readings but at least they did the right thing. In total it will have taken about 2 weeks from the day I lodged the warranty request to the day I receive the mouse, so a little slow (since I use it for work) but no complaints about the support level on balance.UPDATE 5: Changed rating. Replacement mouse failed in under 6 months. Called Logitech and asked for upgraded model, which after verifying that I went through all the right troubleshooting steps (about a 10 minute call), they allowed. You'll have to send the replacement mouse in before they release a new one to you but if you're going to replace this mouse, ask for a different model. This is clearly a manufacturing / design defect."
404,"The first one of these I got had some problems -- the scroll wheel would sometimes scroll on its own and the middle-click would often not work, failing to click maybe 2/3 of the time.  I thought maybe I got a defective mouse, so I returned it and got another.  Same exact problems.  I returned the second one and didn't bother with a third...for that much money, I really expect the product to at least work."
405,"This battery is strange.  The first few days I had the battery, it seemed to be ok.  After that, they battery will only charge if my laptop is turned on.  When it is turned off, the battery light will flash orange four times, and the battery will not charge.  I have been using it now for roughly a month, and after each charge, I'm getting less and less battery life out of it.  I'm currently down to an hour and a half on a full charge.  Im running an SSD and the backlight is turned all the way down on my laptop.  I believe its past the time for returns, so I'm stuck with this battery.  Be cautious of this battery.EDIT*** 12/30/12Now that i have had this battery a few months, i decided to check in on this Midnight genuine battery.  I contacted Midnight, and this is not a Midnight branded battery.  It may say Midnight, but it is not.  Second off, this battery now refuses to charge.  Everytime i attempt to charge it, the Orange blinking light of doom makes a comeback, and i get nothing out of the battery.  Windows will not see it as a battery.  I plugged my old Midnight battery into to see how it would react, and my laptop picked up on it right away and started charging it.  As im writing this, I'm on my old battery that's showing two hours of life.  This battery is terrible, and the M L C distributor is very deceiving.  I have attempted to contact them starting a week after i got it as it started giving me problems.  Its been months, and after multiple e-mails and phone calls later, i have still never heared back.  I would avoid this batter and go with a different brand."
406,"You're looking at this one-star review because nothing can be this good that nobody rates below four stars, right? Sorry to disappoint but this lens is an absolute five star piece of glass. From this amateur's perspective new to m4/3 cameras, professional quality photographs do not get any easier. Solid construction, small, great balance on an Olympus PL-1. I attached, set to iauto, snapped a picture in a dark hallway of my cat with no flash and the result was magazine ready. Unbelievably exciting. I'll post the picture on here if I can.I know I will get some slack for the bogus star rating but a simple computation shows this rating will not affect the overall star rating and should help the pessimistic shopper make a decision."
407,"sorry did I say ""desktop""? I mean DESKTOP REPLACEMENT! and this desktop replacement is the Company F M17xR3! so go ahead and take measurements of your device dimensions before getting excited! 1-star because a lot of 17"" laptops are considered to be a desktop replacement! good day!"
408,"The WD Smartware virtual CD is awful. I know some flash drive and HD's come with software preinstalled on it; so first thing I did was re-format the drive.  The virtual CD drive still popped up along with it's annoying autoplay features.  Apparently it's not even on the hard drive itself; it's on a separate memory card inside the unit.There is NO WAY to permanently remove or disable this extra CD drive that will attach to your computer when you plug this hard drive in. You can disable the ""autoplay"" feature via your computer settings; or ""hide"" the drive via your computer settings.  But as soon as you plug this into a different computer; you have to do it all over again.  Horrible.  Not sure what they were thinking.I promptly returned the drive to the store (didn't buy it at Company A) and picked up a competitor that had NO pre-installed software. Couldn't be happier.I had no problems with the connector for the few hours I owned this; it looked like a mini-USB connector, but I didn't inspect it thoroughly."
409,"Mouse was very inexpensive, and that was my primary criterion at time of purchase.  I bought two. However, with both of them, the cursor skates and skedaddles everywhere without user input.  When you have to find your cursor multiple times during a game session, it takes all the pleasure out of playing.  I can't recommend this mouse, even for non-gamers, as this characteristic is consistent across programs and platforms.  I can't even recommend it at this price."
410,Failed and thrown out.  Not worth trying to return for refund - my time is worth more than that.  Wouldn't recommend.
411,"First of all the directions are tiny tiny and in very broken and bad english you have to translate/figure out what they are saying. Here is my translation.FYI.  I have a Midnight lap top running windows 7.Part A set up:1. Put in micro sdhc memory card. It does not have one and it will not work with out it.  (I suggest you buy from Company A or you will pay $40.00 for a 2 gig version from Best Buy.)2. Put in driver disk.  You will need a ""rar"" extractor to get the driver unloaded.(ignore anything not in english) I use ""free rar extract frog"" (A free program...duh hence the name.) You can download for free from [...]. Search for ""rar frog extractor""Make sure you unpack it to your desk top because I could not get it to work otherwise.3. Then run the spca1528_v2220_mulitilan_090217.exe file by double clicking on it.4.Plug in your dv using the cord that was sent with it to your pc.  The battery can be dead but the dv will still work when hooked your pc by usb cord.5. Ok it should be ready to go.6. Charge battery by leaving plugged in to your pc or charger sent with it.  How long? I don't now and the mfg is not saying. Over night?Part B How to operate1. Push the power button on the side. Not the MODE button!2. 2 blue lights come on and a red one shortly after and is on very briefly showing it is booting up then it goes out. (Mine does not have any yellow lights like the directions say.)3. After boot up you can push the grey button on top to start contious recording.  Mine recorded for 3 min before shutting down after charging all night! I hope yours works better.4. For voice activation you push the mode button after it boots instead of the top grey button.  The red light will flash quickly.  If you YELL at the dv the red light will start flashing slowly which means it is recording.5. When charging 2 solid blue lights mean it is charging and not recording.Part C Use as a PC video camera1. Download ""Capture Flux"" a free program if you don't already have a video camera program. It's a free program of course! [...]So i paid a total of $70.00 for a PC video camera. >:-(  The rechargeable battery does not work.  I'll try and charge it again.  I'll change this review if I get it to charge this time but it should have charged the first time.Poor quality - don't buy"
412,"For the price, it is a quick and easy fix. But, after a month or so, I noticed that my computer would randomly just shut down. I took it to the store twice to try and figure it out. They couldn't see any problem with the computer.  They noticed that the capacity of the battery was not matching what was indicated through the mac software. They suspected the battery was the problem. I have since purchased an original Apple battery and the problem has been solved for now.  I believe the battery was causing the computer to crash randomly."
413,"I purchased this Blu Ray Player at Walmart.  I was very easy to set up and had nice feature BUT that's where the good stops.  During the playing of the first Blu Ray disk, the picture froze.  I couldn't fast forward, stop, rewind...nothing.  I could not even eject the disk.  After calling the company and learning how to get my disk out I took the unit back for an exchange.  Walmart gladly exchanged the unit for another and guess what...same thing.  About half way into my movie the picture froze.  I took back and returned for an LG player.  No problems with my LG unit.  No more Vizio crap!"
414,"Purchased this to avoid a recently added modem rental fee from Time Warner Cable. This model is on their ""approved"" list of cable modems. Unplugged old one that was supplied by Time Warner. Plugged in new one. Called Time Warner and gave them the MAC address printed on the bottom, and after a couple of minutes I was in business. Works fine. I did a couple of quick speed tests and it performs at least as well (if not better) than the Scientific Atlanta modem it replaced.Update 12-26-13: Failed after 1 year of use. Started with intermittent connectivity issues, which progressively got worse and worse over a couple of weeks time. Modem logs show various failures and that the device keeps rebooting itself. Not pleased with the lifespan."
415,"Crap, another case of stupid apple domination of the market.. used to be the competitive nature of mp player lines meant you have several good choices now the market is flooded with absolute rip off quality junk designed to last just long enough to take your money and piss you off."
416,"Despite negative reviews, I took a chance on buying this cable as it is exactly what I was looking for. The packaging is fine and it looks like a quality product. However, the moment I plugged it into my iPhone 4s the cable broke. The heat shrink tubing is loose and jaggedly trimmed, and the plastic housing surrounding the pin connector pulled apart in my hand. This is a cheaply made and inferior product that literally lasted less than 10 seconds out of the box. AVOID."
417,"I purchased this media player to read all the various .mkv, .avi, .mp3's, .mpegs, .iso, etc from my computer and external Hard Drive. I display them on my 1080p TV and get sound to my 5.1 Surround Sound System. The first few days it was great. No more trying to connect my computer to my TV or trying other methods (Xbox 360 anyone).Then I realized that the music player is horribly built. They should just takes notes from itunes and build from there. As it is now its useless.I update the firmware and lost 5.1 surround sound I had to reload the old firmware. Now there are MKV files that are marked as invalid and will not play. So I am doing the dance once more, converting these MKV's to .AVI or other formats.Subtitles that are not hard encoded turn off mid movie so I have to turn them back on.This is not a smooth working media player, it is not worth 5 Stars. Maybe they will put more time into the next firmware and fix all these problems. As for now I cannot in good conscience recommend this Media PlayerDec-19th-2010 update: I just updated to Windows 7 and the asus will not read files from my computer at all. Seems to be an ongoing problem from what I read in the forums."
418,"The keyboard is ok so far, but I can do without the accompanying bloatware. Why does a reputable company do that."
419,"Application: Foscam FI8905W outdoor 802.11g wifi camerasProblem: Just barely out of reach of wifi routerWith the original antennas, the wifi connection was a bit shaky, so I bought these antennas, along with similar +9dB antennas from monoprice.  I used the dB signal ratings on the router, as well as a wifi sniffer on my laptop to measure the signal strength, and these antennas actually made the signal strength worse and couldn't get a signal strong enough from the router to connect at all.  Tried &#34;aiming&#34; the horizontal plane of the antenna at the router as well and it didn't seem to help.  My laptop didn't seem to detect any signal improvement either from any orientation of the antenna.Since they didn't work, I wanted to see what sort of engineering the manufacturers were throwing at these antennas to make them &#34;better&#34; so I cracked both antennas open (this one and the monoprice ones), and they were of the same design on the inside, basically just a long wire in a plastic housing.I ended up buying some old linksys routers, flashing tomato firmware onto them, configuring them as wifi repeaters, linked them up with powerline ethernet adapters at each corner of the house and now the cameras work.  It would have been nice to hook the cameras up directly to the powerline adapters, but the application didn't allow it."
420,"Coming from China not sure it this is just a copy ,one thing the picture here has a 20 clapper at lower left size and the one I receive has no 20 clapper. Have not yet use it ,The question  is how do you know it this is a fake or copy specially coming from China . My fault did not look where is this coming from. So next time ask your self, you got cheap card but are you real getting real card ? Or we are just cheap guy ?"
421,"You will never get what you pay for X-Rite products.You know why? Because they will be on your back and after your money until you get rid off them and their products.They will sell you a device which will be unusable after a short period of time, if you won't pay more and purchase their new software update for your new OS system.We made a research online and we couldn't find any company that sells any device that doesn't provide a free update for their product to work with a recent technology change. However X-Rite is probably the only company that asks a full priced new software update to purchase for their device that you can continue to use it after couple years with your new operating system.Moreover their prices are NOT inexpensive at all. If you had purchased a $1350 calibration device such as eye one display pro UV Cut kit, they will ask from you another $500 for their software upgrade after approximately 2 years when your computer's OS system upgrades. Fanny haa? but miserably true!Plus none of their product will never give the same optimum results as they advertise. As an example we have spent $1400 for a monitor and printer calibration kit and although we tried very hard with their device and software, we couldn't reach a satisfactory point of calibration. So, our prints were worse looking than the pre-calibrated profiles which came with our computer systems. Now they are asking another $500 for their software update to be able to continue to use their device on our Macs with Mountain Lion.The original software which came with the device won't work anymore with Mac OS X Mountain Lion. There are probably no other company in the market who does this greedy trick. We believe, even if we purchase their new software update, we wouldn't have satisfactory calibration results with it.When you call them to look for an alternative solution, they will treat you very rudely with unprofessional attitude and even their managers will mislead you with dishonesty to purchase different products to solve your problem.We called the X-Rite complain department manager, the secretary told us the manager will call us back next day, unfortunately the complain department manager has been with the same attitude and never called us back, indeed we didn't expect more from X-Rite which is clearly a huge spam.As a final conclusion; there are too many negative feedback about X-Rite and  their products that X-Rite products are not worth to buy, nor efficient to use for high end optimum results as they are advertised.BEWARE before making an expensive decision of purchase from X-Rite."
422,"Received a clearly previously opened box with missing parts, such as the battery charging cable (as well as an audio cable)!!. Thus unable to charge and use (the already used/returned) product! - Product may be fine - but how would I know? Terrible and disappointing shipping check and control by Company A. Returning it and in the process consuming work and time for me that I could use better. Shame on Company A!!"
423,"You get what you pay for. Mine stopped working just over 30 days after I bought it. The larger Fuji charger is cumbersome and more expensive, but it works. Don't buy this one."
424,"I have this product since June 2009 and I must say that it is still useless. It was expensive back then. I saved it till now to find out if it still worth it - NADA. Trash, not quality but tempoorary. Thats the thing with Lithium but the CP battery still good on my iPhones."
425,"I had the tablet for a few months, and when I tried to shut the lid, the screen cracked. Checking the forums, apparently this is a COMMON PROBLEM and a design defect. However, Lenovo won't own up to it and wants $250 to fix their problem.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk or anything from Lenovo, they won't stand behind a known flaw in their products. Spend your money elsewhere."
426,"While having lots of RAM, a big hard drive, a really fast processor, and Blu-ray, the screen on this laptop ruins it. They seem to have decided to arrange it so that the screen can be watched by two people sitting side-by-side, from a distance. And it's okay.But, up-close--say, on your LAP--the screen has different colors between the top and bottom of the screen, at any viewing angle. And the backlight is clearly brighter at the bottom. Also, color reproduction at any angle is simply atrocious. The ""Vivid"" colors you see in the store are the ONLY colors you'll ever see. Even if you're looking at something non-vivid. The screen is like computing on a Lite-Brite. It's atrocious.If you want a laptop to watch Blu-ray discs, then, sure, this is a good laptop. If you want it for hobby photography or anything in which color accuracy is needed, run away"
427,Bought to recover some files from an old computer for a family member.  It didn't work for me and I'm fairly competent with electronics.  Maybe I got a bad one but I'd be careful.
428,"Only an acoustic research dvi cable adapted to hdmi seems to allow my sanyo z2000 projector and onkyo 3007 to talk, this and a monoprice 25' hdmi cable just dont allow a good handshake.  Frustrating, but at least this worthless cable was only $12.  I should have went dvi for my 25' run in the first place I guess."
429,"I bought this back in 2011 without any issues, but somewhere along the line it became a major problem. I literally cannot boot my Windows 7 computer without getting a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) if this drive is connected. I even tried changing USB ports and got the same result. Please note, thought, that I don't have an issue getting to my files when plugging this in, so the drive itself works (albeit slowly). This MUST be a major driver problem and who wants to deal with that when all your looking to do is save your precious files."
430,"First of all it's not packed well at all. Company A, you need to explore the possibilites of bubble wrap when shipping delicate items such as hard drives. Cardboard box ---> Cardboard packaging ---> little plastic shell ---> hard drive is probably NOT enough protection. That's the first thing I noticed when I opened up the package...""Wow, that's not packed very well for a hard drive"" I thought to myself. Sure enough, plugged it in and dead. My first drive is still working after a year, but 1 out of 2 is 50% and I remember that being failing grade back in high school."
431,"I'm pretty savvy with PC's and hi-fi equipment.The real issue I have with this ""Universal"" remote is the sheer time it takes to set up! I was under the impression set up was ""30"" minutes and most all of my components sould be ready to work once added to the list of devices.The REALLY odd part was I have an older receiver that had all features but a 3-4 month old Samsung HDTV was no where to be found. I added in manually but each button had to be programmed one by one. A couple hours into it and I realized if I'm finding this difficult, how on earth will I explain this to a baby sitter or grandma???I promptly put it back in the box and plan to return it next week."
432,The system overheated the first 5 hours that I had it and shut down.  Activating the FMTRAFFIC is a pain and the instructions are terrible.  Getting your lifetime maps is a pain as well.  I will buy a competing product the next time as I give up on Garmin as I have had two other GPS's from them fail over the past 4 years.

434,"These earbuds lasted me less than three months (third pair that I've owned), and JLab is unwilling to replace them. Do yourself a favor. Rather than waste your money on these, buy yourself some low end earbuds, and be less annoyed when they break."
435,"Did not read the reviews before I purchased, mistake one. Second was to purchase them. I might have been lucky to get 10 ok disc's out of the 50...then all the time wasted on trying to burn....and on top of it all, I thought the disk drive to burn to the DVD was bad so bought a new one and installed to discover its the disc's not the driver....WARNING, do not buy unless you are ready to throw away money and time!"
436,"Bought this Last March 2011, use for two months and the fan/blower gave up. Avoid this product, unless you intend to use this under a month or two."
437,"I normally don't like to bash product unless they are aweful, and this one fit the bill.  It doesnt fit very well, i guess because of the poor materials used.  Then once I got over the fact that it didnt fit, I was ok.  Then I finally used it in the dark, guess what, it doesnt have transparent letters.  So if you have an illuminated keyboard, the borders light up but not the letters.  How hard would it have been to make this the right way.  I am sad, and it would take more effort to try to send this back as opposed to getting one that works.  If you don't have a keyboard that lights up, then you could try, but it doesnt fit.  Oh well."
438,These are two different technologies that are not meant to be split.  Google it.  Never worked! This is a scam!
439,I got an '03 Toyota 4Runner with 6-cd JBL Synthesis Stereo system.Installation of this FM modulator was fairly straight-forward even though I had to take apart the whole dash - if you've done any kind of car/electrical work before this should be fairly easy. I spliced into the power wire and got this unit to work but the volume was so low (even at highest gain) that you could barely hear it. I had to turn the radio way higher than I ever had before just to be able to make out the words in the song. Needless to say this is useless as any kind of road noise  would drown out the music and switching back to CD or Radio without re-adjusting the volume would most likely blow your speakers and/or eardrums. Very frustrated with the wasted time and effort.
440,"I ordered two of these cables as I needed more length between my PC and my powered AdvanCED USB 3.0 hub.  The first of the two cables did not recognize either of my two USB 3.0 devices (a 64 GB Corsair Flash Voyager GT stick and an ICY Dock).  The LED on the Voyager stick flashed, but would not appear in My Computer.  The cable/hub did recognize USB 2.0 devices.  The 2nd cable saw the USB 3.0 devices, but reported that I was connecting via USB 2.0 connection and for best performance I should use a USB 3.0 connection.  The devices work fine with the original cable provided with the AdvanCED USB 3.0 hub, but I was looking for something a bit longer."
441,"This is horrible, poor communications, very cheap, tiny and wouldn't recommend any one. i would highly recommend the gyration RF keyboard and mouse."
442,"So I get a product recall and am told to incur the cost to ship it back - on my dime.  WHY?  I simply do not understand this company's approach.  Because of this, I will NEVER BUY Transcend Memory card in the future."

444,"I tried this adapter converter to use a SATA Blu ray disc drive in my older IDE desktop computer.  The disc drive would show up in BIOS, but it would not show up in Vista Ultimate.  So it does Not work for Blu ray drives.  However, using it with a regular SATA hard drive, it worked fine.  I was able to read/write to the hard drive.  But, it is better to use a SATA to USB converter instead of this IDE converter as IDE is now obsolete."
445,"Like many others on contour web site, I have discovered this item to be defective. There is a magnet in sliding tab which activates the camera. But this case refuses to activate 2 different CountourHD cameras. As I result, I have to take the camera out of the waterproof case and off the top of my head to activate it. Bad luck struck, and my first camera got wet and failed. When I bought a replacement camera, the case did not work with it either.Since I got the case in the winter and just tried it out, I cannot return it to Company A."
446,"I thought people were crazy who said it worked for 5 minutes and then stopped. Well, that's what happened. It worked for 30 minutes and then it stopped. It doesn't work on YouTube videos at all. You cannot play or pause the YouTube videos at all. Now if someone can suggest a better mouse I would appreciate it."
447,I put these on and have WAAAY to much static.. i mean they work... but u hear white noise low in back ground.. not good... sorry.. hate to leave bad reviews but i literally having them sitting on  the floor of my car.. money down the drain.....
448,This product is very cheaply made. Not impressed at all. The only thing that is neat about this item is the envelope that it was shipped in is covered in Chinese stamps.
449,"This is the slowest machine I have ever used. I wasn't expecting great performance from a netbook, but this is extraordinarily slow even for that. Internet explorer is flat out unusable. Chrome is a little better, but the entire experience is reminiscent of dial up. Battery life is good, but the performance is pathetic. Routine tasks are incredibly frustrating. It can't even handle flash games. I have used other netbooks and had a much better experience. This is the most regrettable purchase I have ever made."
450,"Waste of money. Thing is approx 2in long. Did not charge the IPod shuffle. Looks like it came from china, waste Of time and money"
451,I actually returned the first one I received thinking it was defective.After receiving the second one and continuing to have problems I returned it as well.I called Kodak tech support and they were of little help.It does not seem to be Mac compatible. Does not work with iPhoto.I tried to upload simple JPG files from my desktop and it would only upload 10% of them.I also could not get it to upload all of my JPG files from a jump drive.I tried various different photo files and had problems regardless.I would not recommend this product.
452,"This is a very simple and straight forward adapter; that is used by laptop owners, who are not as comfortable with touchpads as they are with PS-2 Mice. Unfortunately, this one Does Not Work!"
453,"I would caution anybody buying this who will use it with a dash that has leather or faux leather.  I bought this about 8-9 months ago to put in my car and since I got it I had put it in it's place on my dash and did not move it since.  Well, the other day I went to remove it and while it does indeed stick to your dash very well without any adhesive residue of any kind, it does leave a mark/impression in your dash!!!I actually just threw the thing in the trash as won't be using this anymore.  I've had it off of my dash for a few days now and the mark/impression is still on my dash from where it used to sit.  Please see the picture I uploaded to see what I'm talking about...  The mat does not leave a residue or anything behind but you can clearly see an impression left in my dash from the mat... I'm just hoping that eventually it will go back to looking normal but it's not looking promising."
454,One module out of the set caused my BIOS to beep on start-up whenever inserted.  Why am I not suprised?
455,"Just bought a Sony HDR-CX160/B HD camcorder and about 40 seconds into any video the camera says ""C4:00 For use with compatible battery only"" and then turns off.  Sony has offered to replace the battery, but they said it'd take them 7-10 days.  I'll just return this to Company A and have them send me a new one, but if this one doesn't work that'll be the last nail in the preverbal coffin for this Sony camera and its accessories.10 June 2011 update...Well, here's my update.  Got the replacement yesterday, allowed it to charge for a full day in the Sony charger, and it does EXACTLY the SAME THING.  My recommendation would be to NOT bother with this camera or this battery and especially this combination until Sony fixes this problem.  I'm going to Panasonic if Sony doesn't have a solution by Monday."
456,"Well, I looked to return the item, but policy states only a partial refund and I must pay shipping fees back. Doesn't pay since the Iphone USB cord was not expensive in the first place. After 8 weeks of use the piece broke in my iphone, what a task to remove the piece without damaging my Iphone. My honest opinion is to purchase from Apple. Don't risk the copies, they can do more harm than good."
457,"I'm using one right now, it works just fine with a big fan blowing on it externally, need to take the whole thing apart to clean the fan including the motherboard, too much work and it doesn't just unscrew there snap pieces, uncool, they put no though into it.  Without my external fan it overheats in about an hour or less if internet is used, especially streaming.  when I first got it, it worked running three apps facebooks, ie, and whatever else I was doing probably starcraft or something and I could switch between apps with no prob, now it has trouble just doing volume by itself, I've rebooted to factory reset, I've replaced the hard drive that died ( my fault), this computer can barely stream now is constantly doing something the little circle is always spinning, takes about a minute or more to load one web page, sometimes works for you tube videos not always that's how lame this three hundred and fifty dollar rip off is and it's just over a year old, I'd say avoid hp though others have said it's just mine but I just hate hp now, so buyer beware is all I have to say.  My uncle has the same one, one of his many comps, and he says his has slowed down now too, but last time I saw it it was way quicker than mine, maybe mc donalds just has much quicker internet than the high speed wifi I have but come on even without the internet like I said it freezes to a stand still just changing the volume sometimes what's the deal is what I say most the time, and yes I have always owned macs and now I say all comps are junk, was never that impressed with mac's they work great sometimes if you can get all your hardware to register and work at the same time without ext conflicts, oh don't buy this if you want to play starcraft wont work at all after about third month and all you'll hear is man your laggin us out."
458,"i bought it very recently April 2013... This hard drive was designed in 2010 or earlier. 5400 rpm is the speed of the hard drive.While it claims 500 MBPS on USB 3.0, my 250 GB data transfer took about 3 hours on USB 3.0. (Macbook Pro 2013 edition)The drive is too slow and too expensive. If i had the time or patience, i would push for a refund.I bought it looking at the 6GB/second transfer speed on SATA and 500 MBPS over USB. None of those claims are true.There are 2TB hard disks now for 70$.Wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
459,"I had multiple issues with this thing right from the start from screws not threading properly to the thing not wanting to stay mounted when the plastic &#34;teeth&#34; wouldn't properly grip to hold it in place.  I quickly ditched it as soon as possible for a solid metal, sturdy, practically indestructible umbrella holder.  It's not worth spending even a small amount of money on something that will only frustrate you and not do the job it's supposed to do.  Spend a little more money and buy a better product.  I say this realizing that Cowboy Studio is a knock-off version of good equipment but I actually use and like some of their stuff... just not this product."
460,"I've rated this one star due to one major problem in a mouse that otherwise seemed great.  I bought this mouse specifically because it had a weighted free scrolling wheel that you can spin freely for fast scrolling down/up a document or web page.  I'd become very accustomed to this feature on a prior Logitech mouse that failed after about 5 years of heavy use.Unfortunately when you use the scroll wheel on this mouse the cursor ""bounces"" back a bit when you try to stop.  This is true whether you give the wheel a free spin to travel a long distance or if you move it a little to scroll a short distance.  This is very disturbing and makes the scroll wheel virtually useless.  I did note that this problem only occurs when the scroll wheel is set for a free spin.  There is a button on the mouse to change this to a friction click system and this issue doesn't seem to occur with it in this setting.I ended up purchasing a different mouse and this M705 has been sitting on my desk as a ""spare"" since I gave up on it about 10 months ago.  I used it this morning a little when the battery on my other mouse gave out and was quickly reminded of this issue once again.  I've researched this and found that this is a common issue with this mouse and note that there is at least two other reviews here that cite the same problem.If the free scrolling feature is important to you then avoid this item.  If it is not a feature you care about then this is probably a great mouse as I have no other complaints about it and otherwise find the size, button locations and weight very nice."
461,"I took the gamble, and lost $3.95.  The third time I charged the battery, the charger stopped working.  It is made cheaply, and I imagine a connection came loose inside.  Other people have gotten good ones I guess, but it is a shot in the dark."
462,"This mouse is very jumpy on the screen and sometimes it won't work altogether, although the touch pad will still work.  This mouse feels very cheaply made and I am quite disappointed with the product from Microsoft."
463,"This locking shoe is a knock off of Stroboframe's excellent flash shoe mount.  The clamp starts tilting away from the flash as you tighten it.  As a result, you end up with a razor thin, tenuous looking grip on your flash shoe.  I would never trust my three hundred dollar flash on this two bit piece of junk.  The Stroboframe shoes are much better.  If you are a small flash enthusiast (read: strobist), consider getting a radio trigger with a built in shoe instead."
464,"I got this MP3 player because it is powered by regular battery which is supposed to run 10-12 hours.  It was a pain following the skimpy instruction *manual* and/or indicators on the item.  Finally got it powered and playing, but after a month of non-use it DIED on me and now will not power up!!  What a scam."
465,I bought this to hook my computer vga to a tv that was hdmi and it didnt work!!!!! wont work
466,"Didn't work, sent it back.  Wouldn't do anything, no charging lights, no power output, nothing.  Sent it back, awaiting a replacement."
467,"I have used many keyboards on laptops, desktops and typewriters and this is by far the worst keyboard I have ever used.  I have written 5 books on a smaller keyboard on a notebook because this is so poorly designed.  I strongly recommend you get a mechanical keyboard such as ""dasKeyboard"" or even the cheaper logitechs strike better.  Go less expensive or more expensive but don't buy this product.  Who want to deal with miss-strikes if you don't hit dead center on the key?"
468,"The unifying receiver is not ready for prime time. I tried two different mice and with both, the mice simply stop responding when one receiver is used. Currently I have separate receivers plugged in for mouse and keyboard.Tried using this keyboard for weeks but finally got fed up with constant lags in response and dropped characters. The keyboard is 2 feet away from the receiver in direct line of sight. Unfortunately I didn't keep the packaging else I would have returned this as defective. Going back to wired keyboard that's reliable.The function keys are offset further to the right than on most keyboards making alt-F4 a stretch. Otherwise the layout is identical to the wired logitech keyboard I had for several years (that I will now resume using)."
469,"Test conditions:self, 6'-4"", 200#, usually use the large insert on earphones.earphones: white Apple headphones included with every iPod.environment: 1.)home, 2.)in convertble car on freeway, 3.)at gym on treadmill machineI had hoped to use these to listen to music at the gym, which is a surprisingly loud environment.  The picture, with its highly suitable-for-purpose-looking rubber fins looked like they would go down into the ear canal, seal well, and block out ambient noise.  Alas, every one of these assumptions was wrong!First, they do not go down onto the ear canal, partially because they are too short, and partially because the rubber lip that is used to attach them to the earphones increases the diameter of the earphone so much that they no longer fit in the ear well.Second, the do not make a seal with the ear canal, so all of the purposeful-looking little fins might as well not be there.Third, because of these two failings, they do not block out ambient noise much batter than the same earphones without these whatever-you-callums attached.Curiously, they did make the medium to high range of the music to which I listened more distinct, but only when I was listening in a quiet environment.They are probably sturdily made, but I see no purpose in using them, so by that measure, it does not matter how well or poorly they are made, as they will last forever unused.Also, taken just in light of what one receives in the package, $13.50 is an amazingly high price for six non-Company J thin rubber moldings.  Had they worked, that would have been a high, but acceptable cost for the benefits, but at $13.50, they are not worth the risk of trying them just to see if one likes them.  And since none of the three sizes fit any differently than the others, the vendor could have included five, ten, one hundred or even zero sizes and the net result would have been the same.Keywords:  worthless, exorbitant-price, deceptive-claims, junk, buyer-feels-very-stupid"
470,"I got this to mount my T2i for video work. I ended up disassembling it with a couple screws and basically only use the shoulder pad portion. The belly pad doesn't work because breathing makes the camera move up and down with each breath. The unit is pretty bulky and doesn't fit into any camera bags, unless you strap it to the outside, so it never gets used anymore. Instead of using this, I've since moved on to a monopod, which better for my shooting style. Too bad I'm past the return period."
471,"The 'Premier' has a few more features than the 'Series 2' which I liked, however, it has flaws.The one most serious is that ANYTIME your internet hiccups, the Premiere menus will not work  --even for PRE RECORDED shows! In my house, regretfully, this happens a couple times a week. . . (""Son, please reboot the router. . .""is the usual fix)  But unlike the Series 2 the Premiere will not work at all when this happens, you can watch NOTHING even those shows that are completed (Unless you change from HD a rather rude customer service person explained. . .but that is not why I bought the Premiere)Also, customer service at Tivo has gone downhill the last several years.  When I asked why in the world would anyone design software like this?  They were rude.  Rude, when I wanted to return it also.I would only buy this device IF I had a 99.999% reliable internet connection, and then only with caution.Beware.  There are better devices out there."
472,"I did a considerable amount of research before purchasing.  I presume this case would keep sand and dust out, but I am not convinced about water.  It does no work well with screen protectors.  If you have a zagg skin or similar screen protector, don't use this case.  With a bit of heat and a little time, this thing will bond with other plastics, ultimately ripping them off when you try to take your ipad out of the case.  You can't really use the ipad while it is in the case due to the friction between you finger and the case, its like glue.  You may also consider the refund policy.  Most of the time I have no problems with Company A returns and feel very good about purchases I make, at least that I can return the no working items.  A refund on this product is worthless.  By the time you pay shipping both ways and the restock fee, you have no more than the worthless plastic case itself."
473,"Update 07/26:  After just a handful of months, the battery has failed, and the Mac reports it ""needs service"".  Too bad, as the price was right.This battery has worked initially, it fits well, the Mac operates normally.  However it only shows 5400mAh of power, instead of the full 5800mAh.However, for $24, I can live with it.We'll see if this has a normal lifespan."
474,"Oh well - there's always a first time for everything. Unit doesn't read discs. Pretty simple. On the plus side, I was actually able to get a human on the phone on a Sunday to walk me through the reboot/troubleshooting procedure, but we came to the conclusion that it's a dud. I'm sure this is a rarity and happens to every company - but with so many other players on the market, I'm afraid Panasonic blew their chance with me. Might be a good little unit ... when it works. Unfortunately, I'll never know."
475,"Yes, the construction is flimsy.  However, that wouldn't be a deal breaker for me if the device produced good-quality recordings; once my cassettes are digitized I would never use it again anyway.  Unfortunately the sound quality of the music I transferred to my computer using this product was terrible.  There was a substantial background hum, and since the device played cassettes at a speed that was slightly too slow, there was some distortion on the music it transferred.  I was really looking forward to listening to my old cassettes again, and this was a real disappointment.  On the plus side, the product and the software are easy to use, and getting the music to iTunes was a breeze."
476,"Good solid board for the price with enough bells & whistles to keep the above average PC hobbyist interested.  I haven't used most of the advanced features and I simply let the automated overclocking utility do it's thing.  Had no problems setting up in a typical ATX case.  All the standoffs were in the correct position and the on-board connectors for the case are varied enough to accommodate a nice chassis. POSTED first time turning it on.  I have three HDDs running just to get all my stuff from the system I replaced and no problems whatsoever.  The 6gb SATA is noticeably faster than the old SATA and completely trumps the IDE side.  The board has adequate fan connectors so I could put together a very cool-running box.  The on-board graphics capability is good;  I am not a gamer, but plan expand to a discrete video card later.  The on-board sound is also adequate, but I missed the definitive sound I had with my old sound blaster.  So, if you want to put together a rig just to surf the web and check email: this is overkill, spend less money and get something else.  If you are a hard core gamer: it won't do the job, spend more money and get something beefier.  This board addresses the middle ground very nicely."
477,"I am an electronics engineer, device installed with correct pins in the car (no paper clips or other kludges) using solder connections. All was fine for a week. Then the volume up/down started going nuts. When the car is first turned on all is fine, then the volume control begins to get jumpy. Sometimes it will rocket from 10 to full scale with a single click.Factory radio was always perfect, never a glitch when using steering controls. Tech support suggested a few things to no avail."
478,"I too purchased a pico pk-201 in 2011. It worked well for aout a year.  White spots began to appear on the image. Then they multiplied to the point a third of the image was unreadable. I bought a back up unit but wanted to get the first one fixed so that too could be a back-up. Its still under warranty.... so I just called the company...Optoma told me it indeed was under warranty but I would have to pay for the labor...($100) and something else ($25) not to mention shipping. So I asked if they were serious about charging $125+ to fix a unit under warranty that was 2 years old that only cost a bit more and hasn't seen THAT much use. She said ""yes"". I decided then and there to find a better manufacturer...anyone got suggestions?"
479,PROS: easy to install hard drive.CONS: Power over e-sata is very new. I ordered a separate cable for this and this drive will not stay connected to my computer. It'll drop half way through a data transfer. The USB cable that comes with this enclosure requires TWO USB ports and who wants that - today's laptops have less USB ports than they used to.Admittedly my connection problem might be the cable. But clearly the makers of Power over E-Sata have some kinks to work out. (I've read similar connection issues with external USB 3 enclosures as well.)
480,"I am a technically competent PC enthusiast, so trust me when I say... don't buy this router. I have many years of experience setting up servers, routers and switches. I must say, this has been the worst router I have ever owned.My family constantly experiences dropped WIFI and the Ethernet side goes down as well. It constantly loses its configuration to the cable modem. The only way to get it working again is to go through a factory reset routine. This is a pain because I have to re-adjust the configuration each time. All my older routers work flawlessly, but I needed this router for Gigabit speeds.I will RMA this and see if the replacement works. If not, I'll do the eBay thing and go with another brand. I am so frustrated! It's so bad I had to bypass the router just to write this review."

482,"Bad bad bad surprises with this router.First - I'm an uber-techie.  Thought the E3000 would give my kids' friends some easy/safe wi-fi while they were at our home.Router was dirt-simple to install.  Plug it play it, go straight to the admin page.But - noticed it runs really really HOT.  (Like frying-bacon hot.)  Heats up the desk area where it sits.  Not ""normal"" hot here.And - big unexplained problem with the router performance.  Turn it on, hit speedtest.net, everything works fine.  But after a few minutes or hours (no firm rule here), it magically slows down.  Doesn't matter which port you use on the device.  All slow.  Unplug from the E3000, go direct into my fiber-to-the-home Internet connection, and whoosh - all the speed is still there.Back to the Cisco E3000, slows down.Normally, I get 8-10 MBit/sec.  Through the device (hardwired to my Company K), I get down to 700-800 KBit/sec.  A factor of 1000 speed loss.  Painful.Cisco support has no clue.  Lots of waiting, lots of point to hundreds of the exact same complaint.  They just don't know.Yes, firmware patched to latest (12/2010), no other devices on the Lan (or wifi), simple, very fast Company K, Win7, 12Gig RAM, multi-core cpu.But - bytes dribbling across the wire.Turn router off, on.  Then comes back at full speed.  But slows down again - unpredictably.Lots of speculation and ""black magic"" solutions out on the net.  Nothing (NOTHING!) from Cisco.Bad router.  Buyer beware!!JDMc"

Isn't the purpose of protecting the Ipad screen is so you can prevent it from being scratched yet at the same time be able to use it to play game or watch a video.  This product is like a mirror, after applying the screen protector to the ipad you can not see anything except your own image.  TOTALLY waste of money!"
489,"I bought six total screen protectors.  At least three had large creases in the middle of the iPad viewing area, producing huge bubbles.At least two of the protectors had many dust particles already on the adhesive side producing additional bubbles.Strangely, one of the screen protectors appears to be far better than the rest.  While all of the others scratched easily even when using only a fingernail, one protector has been very scratch resistant.  It also went on with a minimum of bubbles (and none in the viewing area)."

491,"If you are buying a new Kindle and want a cover, DO NOT get this cover.  The low rating for this product is not because it is poorly made; in fact, it is made with high quality leather and the craftsmanship is superb.  However, this cover is known to cause what is likely a short to the Kindle and over time, will cause the Kindle freeze, reboot and function erratically.  Check the internet for complaints with this issue.  Problem appears to be the metallic hooks used.  The cover with light has plastic hooks and has not known to cause malfunction of the Kindle.  If you are experiencing Kindle problems when you are using the cover, disconnect your Kindle from the cover and call the Kindle support line and let them know your problem.

493,"I received this radio for Christmas and was extremely excited to set it up and listen to my favorite XM programming (namely Howard Stern). In any case, the signal went from no service to barely any service within my home (ok fine) so I setup the antenna and received signal. I then went to my gym where I primarily wanted to use the device (signal bounced from 0 to a few bars off and on) so I couldn't listen even when I was close to the window. So basically, I need an antenna in my home and an antenna in my car...and can't listen to it in the gym. So I guess if I ran outside in a metro area it may work, who knows. But it is hardly a portable option. If you want portable XM just install the app on your phone. This is really a silly product."

All was well for the first few days but when I put the drive in my laptop one day, the message came up ""Drive not recognizable by this device, Reformat?"" I did, losing whatever contents were.This started happening with increasing frequency. Eventually I narrowed down the issue. If nothing touches the drive while it's in the computer, it's fine. If you accidentally touch the drive and it moves up or down, it requires reformatting. Considering I use the drive with other devices attached, while moving in a vehicle, or on a rather crowded desk, it happens very often.The drive is also excessively slow being written to. All in all, I'd look elsewhere."

Even software and firmware updates, which require relatively little, continually crash. I live in a town house, so the distance for the signal to travel is short; furthermore, all other wi-fi enabled devices work fine and have full signal strength. It is clearly the product.

The exact same thing happened. Both pair of headphones audio quality swiftly faded after a few uses.If I were you I would spend the money for a product that you are guaranteed to appreciate and know you bought something worth the money because theses are not it.

Right out of the box, I could only hear any sound in the left ear bud by wiggling the wires around.  The worst part wasn't not being able to hear the music in stereo- these headphones would crackle with static as the music faded in and out.My regular headphones work fine with iTunes on my computer.  When I plugged these into my computer, not only was there an unbearable amount of static that was much, much louder than the selected volume but it would also cause my computer to make a sound which was a cross between static and feedback.  Normally, my computers speakers are entirely mute when I plug into the headphone jack.Another negative- while, as claimed, the headphones do have an 'inline remote' feature that allows you to adjust the volume(though the volume adjustment does not affect the volume of the static) and advance to the next track on your playlist, the placement of it is very poor.  I would guesstimate the headphones from the jack to the ear buds is about 46"" long.  The wire splits into a Y at about 34 inches and both buds are equidistant from the junction.  The little cylinder with the volume and skip buttons is maybe 5 inches from the right earbud.  For me, that means the control sits just above my collarbone.  I think I would prefer it lower as on other headphones I have used before.  The buttons are small and relatively sensitive and are up high enough that I had to take the right bud out if I wanted to see what I was doing.  I suppose with a bit of practice, I could probably figure it out without looking at it- but thought I would mention it anyway.Finally, I don't know about anyone else but my headphones go everywhere with me.  I usually stash them in my purse.  This product did not come with a case which would have been a nice addition, especially considering that these seem to be a bit frail.On the plus side, the ear buds fit very nicely and I am very intolerant of ear buds that don't fit comfortably. The headphones came with  Also, these really did block out all outside noise when I had them in.  I am considering cutting off the wires and just using them as ear plugs.  Of course, if you are reading this- you are not likely looking for earplugs so your mileage may vary.I was never able to get clear sound in the right bud- just too much crackling and static for me to comment on the quality of the music.  So, yes, provided you don't get a pair like mine, these headphones may work for you if you are looking for comfortable headphones with a noise cancelling feature.A final note- the packaging was both terrible and amazing.  They come sandwiched between two molded pieces of plastic with about a gazillion little pieces of tape holding the wires in zigzag pattern.  I spent far too long trying to carefully peel the pieces of tape off in order to remove the product without damaging it.  The package also had another plastic tray, a piece of cardboard and then of course the instructions in pretty much every language(well, ok, not EVERY but like 10) and all this was packed in a box which was 1""+ x 7"" x 3"".Overall, terrible but would have been pretty okay if the sound quality wasn't compromised."
501,"This product has a fatal flaw that would have been a deal killer if I had done a little research and read some of the threads on other websites, including Apple's, before I purchased this machine. This is my *third* one of these machines since October 5, 2010, when I placed the original order. The new mid-2010 MacBook Pros have graphics problems and no one can seem to figure out what it is and Apple doesn't seem to want to admit there's a problem. Every single machine I've had (including this one) has a suspiciously similar problem: graphics processing. The screen randomly turns into a mosaic/tiled look when using Safari and iTunes (both Apple products) and I have to turn the machine off to get rid of the problem. Two brand-new machines have gone into kernel panic. I spent this much money for a poorly designed product?? I'd like to think I didn't, but that would only be kidding myself. I plan to sell this machine and get a new model when Apple starts producing a MacBook Pro that doesn't ship with unresolved hardware problems. I love Apple products; this is my 5th or 6th Apple computer, but the mid-2010 MacBook Pros (*all* of them) have a very serious problem that should have been tested and resolved before the design went into production.**UPDATE** December 5, 2010I think I may have found a workaround of sorts to the problem I initially described. The machine I am working on now, which is the computer in which this review is listed, has done that tiled/mosaic effect thing described above a couple of times. Each time, I have gone into Energy Saver in the System Preferences menu and unchecked the box labeled ""Automatic graphics switching"". Each time, the tiled/mosaic look has immediately disappeared from the screen, without rebooting or any other action on my part. If you do this, you will have to uncheck that box every time you restart the computer because it appears that it is something that System Preferences wants to have checked and it will re-check that box after you have restarted the machine. Just remember to do that. I love the idea of dynamic graphics switching. Apple should have done more to ensure that it operated trouble-free, and acknowledge that there is a problem. I should not be having these problems with a computer that costs this much.**UPDATE** January 15, 2011I am getting rid of this machine as soon as I can. Regular kernel panics and the razor sharp front edge are the nails in the coffin.Kernel Panic. It regularly goes into kernel panic, currently about once a week. I've got about 15 windows/tabs open in Safari, 10 or so text-only Word docs, 3 or 4 uncomplicated Excel files, and maybe 2 or 3 Acrobat Pro files, along with a few other normal things (solitaire, preview, iPhoto, etc.). This shouldn't be enough to cause a machine with the resources this one has to go into kernel panic. I should probably take it to the Genius Bar. I did that with the other two machines of this model that I had -- both pronounced defective.Sharp Front Edge. The reviewer below is absolutely correct about the razor edge on the front. I thought it would be OK, but the *sharp* edge on the front is a truly painful experience that is starting to make me wince at the thought of sitting down at this machine. Thanks to my fellow reviewer for the info on the rubber protective sleeve. Maybe I can find one and make the machine ugly so I can have another reason to get rid of it.Most disappointing Apple experience ever.**UPDATE** March 9, 2011Apple store put in a new main logic board under warranty, which includes replacing that dreadful graphics processor. Machine went into what appeared to be permanent kernel panic this morning. Nothing I did, including resetting PRAM, among other things, would keep the machine from going into kernel panic, usually while the apple logo that shows during startup was still on the screen. Just as a point of reference, the cost to replace the MLB is about $1500 ($500 for the board alone). Three days to repair. Machine has never worked better or faster. Hope it stays that way."
502,"Sound is excellent. Construction is so bad, it is getting broken every 3-6 months and replaced by Skullcandy warranty. I'm sick and tired of replacement wait time and hassles. Stay away from Skullcandy in-ear headphones, all of them have poor construction."
503,"These were a complete waste of money. The silicone tips transmit every bump and vibration from the wire, which are way too long BTW. I can hear my own heartbeat from the blood vessels in my ears like a bleeping stethoscope.The only way to get decent sound is to remain completely still which makes these earbuds useless. I'll try some other pair."
504,Did not work at all. Would not recommend to anyone. It did not work. Spend your money on a nicer one.
505,It did not last even 3 months and started to suture after that. I had to by the original battery.
506,"There are worse 3d camcorders out there, but this one is really bad. There is no adjustment for the &#34;cross eyedness&#34; so no matter the distance of the subject it is set for &#34;infinity&#34; which means you will get headaches watching the playback."
507,"This device doesn't work as written in its manual and as advertised. It's garbage for me since the day it arrived. I tried to configure it many times, in different days, but I was never able to see any output from this device on my LG TV."
508,This product only lasted for approx. 3 weeks.  While I originally wrote a good review that is not valid anymore.  Once again I have to buy a replacement cord.  DO NOY BUT THIS ONE&#62;
509,"1st off DICE Electronics doesn't make this device anymore.  It's now an Audiovox product.  And just like anything Audiovox touches, they buy out companies for the name and reproduce the once quality units with cheaper components.  So this listing will most likely be substituted with the Audiovox unit.  Send it back or just order the cheaper Audiovox unit.2nd-  I won't pin this on Audiovox but there is a long running issue with static, interference and ""chirping"" when the text changes on the screen.  It is extremely annoying and ruins your audio experience.  Search the web for ""mediabridge chirp or interference"" and see the fun.  Some people can live with this awful noise but pretty much everyone hears it.3rd- I contacted the Audiovox support team which is supposed to be old DICE employees.  Asked if they had any software or technical insight on this issue.  Took their advice and remedied my out of date NAV firmware. Moved the wiring to other locations. I even went as far as to remove the unit and swap it to a newer car but the noise was still there. So, after many wasted hours of my life, they told me that the DICE unit is not compatible with my BMW (as it's advertised).  So, I asked what they were going to do for me and they told me that they would close the case.  WHAT!?  No offer to replace or reimburse, just silence.  After owning this product for 2 whole weeks.  What a joke and complete let down. Buyer beware is the age old story here.  You've been warned."
510,"Received a very noisy fan, seller sent a 2nd fan that was nosier than the first. Now if I want my $19.00 back I have to pay return postage. I should not have to pay for defective merchandise. These are not exact replacement fan, and possibly factory 2nds or gray market. Also wire harness is too short and adapter is not correct. I actually found a replacement for $5 (Company A has same one for $9StarTech.com 92x25mm Ball Bearing Quiet Computer Case Fan with TX3 Connector FAN9X25TX3L (Black)) though I had to scab in the proper connector from the old fan. I should not have to pay for defective merchandise."
511,"I have a Samsung laptop and even though this product claims to work with Samsung, it does not work with mine.  There is no way on the Lenmar website to find more tips to fit.  Disappointed I have a long plane trip coming up and no backup power for my laptop.  These batteries need to be more specific as to whether or not they are going to work with a particular laptop or not."
512,"Not sure about the other 1 star reviews, yes this is not the same ""contours"" as the unit displayed, but this unit causes Mac 10.8.4 to freeze instantly.  This is being attached to a GO-FLEX DESK 2TB drive that has had a firewire 800+USB2 base attached for 2 years.  I called Seagate and they said that it is defective and they were not certain if that they did actually manufacture it since the info on the base was not how they imprint their hardware.  It is on it's way back to Company A and then to Oceanside Store in Las Vegas... Beware of anyplace claiming to be ""Oceanside"" when they are 4.5 hours away from the ocean!"
513,I should have returned it the first time I used it.  The pins come out and spent over 15 minutes trying to align it.  A year later I am still having problems with it.
514,"If you took the time to read some of the other reviews, you would have read that this TV has a problem with image cutting in and out for no reason. Sure enough, my TV started doing this immediately out of the box. I contacted customer support and began a very frustrating process of explaining the problem. After 45 minutes of back and forth and getting nowhere, I asked to speak to someone from technical support. The representative informed me that the technical support staff was in a meeting and I would be called within the week. I then asked to speak to another support rep, and she said they were all busy. I left my info and hung up. I called back about four hours later and the same exact women answered the phone. In other words, ""technical support"" consists of one outsourced secretary answering a phone, taking your info, and having someone call you back within a week. This may be ok for some, not for me, especially when the TV arrives broken. Besides all of the customer support issues, which are important to me, the picture quality on the TV is sub-par.  Black's become extremely washed out from the overbearing whites and it's sharpness is extremely lacking. Even if had been perfect out of the box, I would have given a negative review."
515,"When I received this cover my first thought was that it didn't look like the material was of the best quality. But, figured I'd give it a chance. Turns out I was right. I haven't had it that long and the material is already splitting at the corners. I don't believe for one second that the cover is real leather.  I'm not really all that hard on my stuff, so the problem with this item is that it is simply a cheaply made, poor quality cover."
516,"Nothing to brag about. I make YouTube vids and I suggest u don't get this if that is your purpose.The sound has been whack since day 1. Why not return it, you ask? I got a flip so I'm not pressed. When I find the time I just might do it though, but I stay busy. I'd rather throw this bitch against the wall before they ""repair"" it and sell it to someone else.It makes a crackle/pop sound in all ur vids.There is a screen that pops up that says the audio isn't being recorded when it is.It'll switch to capturing audio from another device with no warning so u gotta check everything twice before u start recording.Don't buy. Two thumbs down."
517,"Anyone that knows anything will know that the Canon batteries almost always last longer than their aftermarket counterparts, despite the aftermarket ones usually garnering higher capacity ratings. However, this battery was absolutely terrible. At 2000mah, it was rated nearly twice the capacity of the original Canon battery, but yield about 20% as much shots as the Canon battery.Had the battery been rated as such (20% of the Canon battery's capacity), I would not complain, but at nearly twice the advertised capacity I expect it to last at least AS long as the Canon pack, but no.To me, this is completely unacceptable and I returned the battery for a refund.I would instead get the Power2000 battery. I also had one of those and was pleased with its performance. It lasted nearly as long as the Canon battery."
518,well although the fisheye lens of the same brand is really a good product by the same price this one is just an awful piece of equipment. the quality of the lens is above the average (a lot of deformations and so on) and the telephoto effect is useless too.
519,"These would not connect when joined with a 15 foot USB cable, totalling 30 feet.  After Internet searching, USB is only supposed to work up to 16 feet, though another review says it worked with a 6 foot cable."
520,"I have used Philips items in the past with great success; however, these lightscribe DVDs are duds!  I have had more coasters than not.  I will not be buying this product again.This is no reflection on Company A, just the product itself."
521,"I have the Graft Concepts Leverage case for my iPhone 4S.  I love this case, but this cable does not work with it. It doesn't lock into place and is therefore useless to me.  Too bad."
522,"This cable said it was for my camera, but it was not right. i returned it for a prompt credit."
523,"I got this cord to replace a power charger cord for my Kodak Easyshare digital camera. But even though in the listing (not in the title, but in the listing itself) it said that it was compatible with my camera model (EasyShare M580) the cord did not fit and/or did NOT recharge the battery.Worse, because I had bought this cord in a ""time crunch"" to recharge a camera that I wanted to use to take pictures of an important occasion (a farewell event for my ""alma mater"" high school which was closing & merging/consolidating with the district's other high school) and I was unable to charge the camera, instead I had to use an older camera that I was planning to put up for sale on eBay.I would have returned this cable, but because it would be more hassle to send it back than its worth with a refund, I didn't bother to return it.But the information in this listing is very misleading. Regardless of what it says, this cable is NOT compatible with a Kodak EasyShare M580 digital camera.I found out the hard way! :("
524,"I'm using this mouse on a Windows 7 x64 machine, and could not get the mouse to reliably work.  I had the same issues with Logitech's MX revolution mouse, but have never experienced the issue with any Microsoft wireless mouse.  Also, I own the K800 Logitech keyboard which uses the exact same unifying receiver, and that keyboard performs beautifully.  I troubleshooted this product for hours, and even tested it on another system (laptop) in the middle of a parking lot to eliminate any possible wireless interference, and it still stuttered and lagged.In total, I've tested three different Logitech mice that use a unifying receiver, across three different PCs, in three different physical environments, and each one performed just as horribly as the last.  Obviously my experience is not normal based on everyone else's reviews, but I am sticking with my wired mouse if this is supposedly one of the better rated options."
525,"thought that i was purchasing a wireless keyboard and mouse, probably did not read the copy description very well.  just assumed in this day and age it would be wireless"
526,"0 stars is what is deserves.I tried one of these with my Blackberry - my review is as follows:""I don't have the words to describe this device...one does come to mind. Horrible.I spent weeks trying to set it up and finally got it working - it worked for exactly two days and the software crapped out on me. I had to wipe my entire Blackberry, restore it, and then reload the Zentral application... Got it back up and running and it crashed on me regularly.I would not recommend this to anyone - the amount of effort it takes to setup is just not worth the comfort that it ...""-------------------------------------------That was my first experience.I then figured it was time to try it on my iPhone - same horrible experience just different hardware and software.  It took  multiple tries of actually getting the thing to pair with my iPhone; once paired it only worked for half of my devices.  It worked for my Samsung TV, but not for my Sony Blu-Ray player, not for my Denon receiver, and had much trouble changing channels on my dish receiver.SKIP it...ULTRA FAIL."
527,"I purchased this strap after my old and beloved crossbody strap started falling apart and getting kind of stinky from years of use.  I'd heard lots of people RAVE about the Black Rapids so I figured I'd jump on the train.  I'd been assured that all of the issues with the clips/screws coming loose had been resolved and not to worry about that anymore.They were wrong.I shot my first wedding with this strap and I was elated with how comfortable the strap was and how easy it was to shoot with.  I like the way it easily zips up and down the body and goes back down.  All of the horror stories of cameras falling to the ground worried me though so I kept a constant hand on it, tightening the screw (which DID come loose) throughout the day.  Right before the entrances - I notice something give way on the strap.  THANK GOD I had my hand on the strap!!!!  The clip of the carabiner (which screws up to ""lock"") had come undone and the clip opened and dropped the camera!  Thank goodness I was holding it!  After that it has done this a few more times during heavy use.  I've not had it happen during portrait shoots but it's happened at least once at every wedding I've used it for.I'm now on the hunt for a better strap.The comfort and ease of use is amazing but not worth the cost of broken gear."
528,"The unit  worked properly for two days and then the problem started: it would not decode the surround sound. I called Yamaha support but got automated response that it was the ""lunch break"" so no representatives were available. A lunch break?! Really?? ... I called later so the only thing they could offer was resetting the unit's microprocessor. It did help but the very next day the problem returned. I called them again and after 30 min waiting was disconnected. Called them again but they offered no help. Tried to download the firmware update from their site-mission impossible! The site just won't let you do that. Called them again, they said they were going to burn it on a CD and mail it to me. They never did.  Never again will I deal with this company.Luckily for me I bought it on Company A so I sent it back and they reimbursed me.As for the sound quality :it's OK, but not more than that.It lacks fullness. Very limited equalizer options. Nothing to write home about..."
529,No noticeable improvement in reception in my location ... it actually reduced the number of channels that my TV could find when scanning.
530,Got this PSU for my new machine. It worked for 4 hours. Now the machine will not power on and the PSU makes a sizzling sound.Went to the local store to get another similar Corsair GS700 which worked pass the 4 hours mark but makes weird sounds as if the fan blades touch something. The weird part is that the noise comes and goes.I was ready to get a replacement for the AX 750 and keep the GS700 as backup but I think that I will go with another brand instead. Corsair is really not reliable. I hope the other stuff I got from them (cooler and memory) will work more than few days.
531,was not compatible with the other brand of ram i had installed at the time. and when i used just the komputer bay ram my computer was constantly crashing..I would not recommend this product
532,"I almost never write reviews, but felt the need to say something on this one.  I'm not disgruntled or angry just want others to know what happened to us with customer service with Lorex.  If you are looking at two monitors that are relatively the same, you might want to go with the non-Lorex one just based on customer service.We ordered this product well before our son was due because it was on sale and it seemed like all video monitors had some issue or another.  So we picked one and went with it. When we put it all together when our son showed up, it was pretty straightforward and easy to use.  I thought it was quite logical and did provide some peace of mind on how he was doing without us going in his room. However, the battery would not take a charge at all.  So, it had to constantly be plugged into the base for it to work.  I contacted customer support - ultimately via email because getting them on the phone is difficult.  They did not respond to the first 3 emails either - until I noted it was a warranty issue (be sure to register it for warranty as soon as you get it). I then got a response a few days later asking for additional information (when purchased, etc.).  I responded. A week later I got the same questions. I responded.  A week later I got a request for me to fax the invoice to them.  I did that. A week later I got a phone call asking that I mail the product back to them for a replacement to be sent to me.  No information on where to mail it, what to include, etc.  And never once did anyone apologize for any inconvenience or even act like there was a human on the other end of the conversation.  I am no on hold with the company to find out how/what to send in.  The product is not bad, if it worked properly. The customer support, on the other hand is really awful."
533,I read all the other reviews and it sounded great. A may have just got a lemon? no one else seemed to have the prblem i did.
534,"My Mitsubishi started to go dim again. This is the second time I have changed the bulb on my 73 inch Mitsubishi which I bought four and a half years ago. The original lamp lasted 3500 hours. The second replacement lamp lasted 2000 miles. To my surprise and delight, these two bulbs did not just suddenly die. Rather the picture got darker and eventually I caught on to the issue.But this time was not like in the past. The bulb started dimming a month after I purchased it. The bulb conveniently failed just after the 150 days. Most of the 150 days that it did ""work"" it was dim. Would not buy this brand again."
535,They sent me two of these and neither worked. There compatabilty claim was not correct. The product would not power my flash what so ever. I got a refund.
536,"I purchased this drive to replace a 1/2TB drive from Seagate that I misplaced. I intended to use it to cart large files around, and did not care for all the software that comes with the drive. The drive I received from Company A was defective, so I called WD and they agreed to send me a replacement. The replacement was also defective, so they sent another replacement, which is also defective. At this point i will be returning the 3rd defective drive to Company A for a refund, and likely will not get a WD drive again.Customer service at WD was professional and courteous, so I have not complaints there."
537,"i have put together many toys, furniture, house and garden items, and, yes, computers.  the instructions (or should i say distructions) that come with this radio will want you to drop kick it into oblivion!"
538,The product didn't work and I had to return it. The flash drive would show on explorer and would disconnect by itself.
539,"I purchased the Philips Fidelio DS1100 because I wanted:a) a clock that wasn't like a lighthouse beacon at my bedsideb) a charging station for my iphonec) the ability to have an alarm clock that would wake me up using the iphone's music collectionFor the first two, this product performs far beyond my expectations.  The time can be made so dim that it barely appears in a pitch black room and it charges my iphone superbly.However, for the third requirement it needs the Philips DockStudio app.  Ok, I'm fine with that.  It's a free app that runs on your iphone that allows you to set the alarm and alarm source.  Great, I have no issue with that ... only now in order to use the device you have to keep your iphone on, not locked, not off and the app running in the foreground for it to activate the alarm -- only doing all of that gives you maybe a 50/50 chance that it actually works.  The alarm sometimes goes off with your song on the iphone that you selected; sometimes it picks the bell integrated sound even though you have a song selected; sometimes it just buzzes angrily at you for a minute and then stops; sometimes it just flashes the screen once and then does nothing; and sometimes it wakes you up at 2am (the alarm is set for 6am) by playing a random song on your iDevice.While I love the first two features of this device, the third is a deal breaker.  If you are thinking about buying this item, look on the iTunes store and see if DockStudio has been fixed yet.  If not, I wouldn't recommend this device.I needed a charging station downstairs in the living room, so I've moved the unit down there since if you are there to activate the device via the app it plays music through the sound system quite well, but the app just  sucks as an alarm clock because you never know when it will go off, what it will do, or if it will wake you up at 2am for no reason."
540,All that really has to be said about this product is that it has to support to actually keep your micro sim card from falling through the &#34;tray&#34; with that being said it's actually useless unless you are willing to risk getting your micro sim stuck into your phone.
541,"I tried this product in an Intel Atom N450 netbook and it didn't live up to my expectations.  Whereas if you are streaming a 1080p YouTube video you get no hardware decoding, but if you download the same video and then watch it from the file you get the hardware decoding.  My understanding that there is not enough software support for this device for it to work in more applications.  For me, its uses are very limited.  Very disappointing product.  I am returning mine."
542,"This power supply is advertised for an Acer Aspire 5517. This is not the correct power supply. The power cable falls out at the slightest movement.My research shows that the Aspire 5517 has only one connector size and it is not this one, apparently.If you have an Acer Aspire 5517 laptop, do not buy this power supply."
543,I spent a month going back and forth to get a battery that worked! Never did get one and got my money back but it sure seemed like they didn't care!
544,"Maybe I received a defective unit, but this item broke on the very first use.  I cannot recommend using this product."
545,"Ordered this because i wanted to play videos off my Droid X on my TV, and several reviews say it works well. HOWEVER... this is the last piece of my 3 item order (everything else got here in less than a week) and the estimated delivery date is May 24th, 6 weeks after the order was placed on April 12th. Seems quite slow even for default shipping.  Will revise rating if cable shows up in reasonable time."
546,"I'm now paying the price for being an 'early adopter'. I'm typing this on the sister keyboard to this one which is the wired version. It has performed so well that I was excited to get what I thought would be the same in a wireless version. First I was dismayed to see that had changed the key layout a bit, the worst being cutting the Del key in half so they could squeeze an 'Ins' key into the same space. The backlighting is triggered by a proximity sensor that turns the backlighting on for a few seconds. Often it does not activate the backlight until you actually press a key, then it goes out again very quickly, and once again if you are typing in the dark you can't find the keys you need until you press something on the keyboard. This kind of defeats the purpose. Then after about 7 weeks the space bar started to stick. I carefully lifted it and blew in compressed air even though I could not see anything in there. That did help for a few days, and then a few days later it returned and the same thing happened to the Enter key: you depress it and it stays down, slowly working its way back up again. Again I lifted it from the bottom edge and looked under and it appears to be a mechanical problem with the design of the plastic lifting mechanism underneath because the actual switch pin seems to respond properly.Now I'm going to have the dubious pleasure of testing their warranty service, and I'll report back on that if I can as well. Overall I would say do not purchase this keyboard as it appears to suffer from some serious design flaws relating to not only the proximity sensor, but also the key mechanisms.Edit: Dec 29. Called them the day I wrote the review. I noted that I did not have to wait on hold long, and the lady was quite nice. They gave me a case number and could not deal with the issue at the time because they had no stock of the same item. They said in 3 weeks to call them back and if they still did not have any stock they would offer a replacement with a product of equivalent value or an 'upgrade' to another product of greater value. The obvious question in my mind (being a typical cheap Scot that usually buys items on sale if possible) would be, would I want to upgrade to anything based upon the full retail price of the new item rather than what you'd get it on sale for? In desperation I again lifted the keys and sprayed 'invisible glass' solution under them, and then blew them out with compressed air. That must have lubricated the sticky mechanism because they worked for a couple of days before starting to get a slow rebound response again. So next I used a marine spray that has a bit more lubricity to it, and again blew it out with compressed air. I must have used to much and shorted some contacts on the PCB as now I got some keys that repeated themselves or added characters when pressed. So I left the keyboard to dry and tested it daily. On the third day it was back to normal and remains normal to this day with no apparent ill effects. So I have not called Logitech back. I'm thinking to just leave it and see how the keyboard responds over time. Given what happened I can't help but wonder if something sticky got under the keys somehow (I never drink coffee, etc., when I'm at the computer and don't type with 'sticky fingers' so it seems unlikely). As it happened to the two most often pressed keys I wonder if the key mechanisms are so delicate and precise that they simply get sluggish as they are exposed to ambient dust from the environment. I've also noticed that if you leave it plugged into the charging cable, it seems to stay backlit, so that's one possible solution for someone who wants to use it in a completly dark room. Another thing I seem to notice is the keys are starting to feel and sound a bit more 'clicky' than they did when the KB was new, whereas the sister keyboard to this (the wired version) still seems to have the same tighter and silenter response that it originally did. Anyway I hope that my fix to the problem may be more than short term and it can help anyone else with a similar problem. I think in view of the fact this is priced to be positioned as an 'upmarket' product, Logitech may be on to a good thing in principle and this would be a good product with a couple of engineering and design tweaks made to the next generation of this product, and perhaps a price adjustment to make it about 30% cheaper.Note: For anyone attempting the same repair I did, note that the chicklets do not come completely off. If you gently pry them from the bottom edge, the bottom detaches and somehow seems to hinge from the top edge, from where they do not seem to want to readily detach. I feared trying too hard to get them to come completly off may result in disaster, not the least would be if you could not reattach them properly, you'd definetly have no case for a warranty return at that point! Also note that I'm probably lucky that the substance I sprayed in evaporated enough to stop shorting the PCB contacts after a few days, perhaps if I had used another more 'oily' substance that did not evaporate as readily, I may not have been so lucky and I'd simply have a bricked keyboard that would no longer be under warranty."
547,Mouse works great for a few weeks but then suddenly it started having tracking issues with the rechargeable battery that was included with the mouse. It worked fine once I pulled out that junk Samsung battery and put in a normal double A battery but then the mouse dies one day later with the double A battery.I have had other wireless mouse that have better tracking and better battery life than this piece of junk. In fact the battery for my laptop mouse has been in there for over a month and still going strong and it's just a normal battery..I do not recommend buying this Logitech product and I'm going back to my Logitech MX518 mouse.
548,"We live in a rural area and the town closest to use just got a new Verizon tower.  After messing with this thing for a couple of weeks - changing out cables, different locations, etc I went to the company for support.  I was SHOCKED to find out that this unit does not work for Verizon 4G.  For that you need a different, more expensive model and I was outside my return window.  In fact - all this thing will really do is possibly make your call connection better.  Please note that even that did not work with my verizon phone."
549,"Did not work.  I tried every possible setting on my wireless router.  It simply would not accept the password.  Since I have a blue ray player with wireless access for what I need, I returned it."
550,If you are reading reviews on this product you do not know enough about them to get these working!!Find one that has an installation disk and pay the extra money!!!You will regret it otherwise!!
551,"First surprise out of the box is that the provided connection software does not support any Mac OS greater than 10.6. So, it won't recognize or run in Lion. Linksys has no more up to date version available that works with this model. I had no luck getting the router to pull down an IP via DHCP from my DSL modem. My Buffalo WHR-G300N that I'm already connected with has no such problem. I was hoping to use the e1000 as a primary AP and flash the G300N with DD-WRT as a bridge. I'm now back to only the Buffalo. The e1000 fresh from the box will now be a $25 doorstop. Was hoping Cisco Linksys would be a trustworthy name. It's not."
552,"I bought this intent on using it for myCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II SLR Lens. I have a UV filter already on the lens, and it DOES thread into that just fine. Although that tiny increase that the filter gives it, I get dark corners. Taking the UV filter off solves this, but it does not thread as well on the stock lens threads.But that's not even the worse part. You have to REMOVE the lens hood to attach the lens cap! Wish I would have read more of the negative reviews before purchasing, but hopefully this will help you all out in your decision.I reccomendRainbowImaging Lens Hood for Canon EOS EF-S USM 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 I, II, IS Lens, 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 II, II USM, III, IV, V,& 28-90mm f/4.0-5.6 Lens (replaces EW-60C, Flower version)instead."
553,"This is a review for the ""Cowboystudio 9 feet Heavy duty Cushioned Premium Black Light Stand for Video, Portrait, and Product Photography"" sold by Company A. I like these stands.  They suit my needs well.  Gets one star because I am tired of Cowboy Studio products not being delivered as they are pictured on Company A.  This stand did not come with the bag that is pictured.  That is the main reason I bought the stand.  I like the others I have and the bag they came with works well...and it is impossible to find a bag that is the right size for the stand.  If you do, it will likely cost as much as the stand.  Although they are exactly the same stand, I recommend the PBL stands because they were always delivered as pictured when I ordered them."
554,"I have purchased two of these motherboards (I assemble PC's as a part time endeavor) and had to replace both of them fordifferent problems. The first one lasted about two weeks then began having USB power surge problems. After spending quitea lot of time diagnosing the problem I determined it was the motherboard. I obtained a warranty replacement, installed itand the problem was resolved. The second one lasted about 3 months then began having hard drive controller problems. Afteronce again spending a lot of time diagnosing the problem (and a couple of hard drive replacements) I determined the problemwas (once again) with the motherboard. Replaced the motherboard and the problem was resolved! I can not recommend thisboard, due to my personal experience with these failures. True, it's inexpensive, but then I suppose you get only whatyou pay for! Until this experience, I had a high opinion of Asus boards. If you want a reliable motherboard, then expectto spend at least a hundred dollars."
555,"The straps are semi-hard and I can see they will adapt to wider shoulders well, but not narrow shoulders. As a result, when I carry this back I feel the weight is all distributed in the very far end of my shoulders on only half of the width of the straps, as a result, the straps tend to slide down very easily, even after I set the length to minimum.Construction and materials seem to be fine, although the separation between pockets and the tablet pockets are quite flimsy. When you put a tablet in the tablet pocket, the backpack becomes out of shape. Then the backpack pocket is so wide, and also semi-hard, without any secure strap like my previous SwissGear did. So when I put my Macbook Air in the laptop pocket, it just keeps swinging around and I have to put some books in there also to keep it from moving. They also claim (in video/pictures) that you can maybe put a water bottle in the side pockets, but that's exactly how I lost my Nalgene!Overall, this is a very uncomfortable with poor designs. I really regret buying it."
556,"Air Link tech support told me this will work with my power pc based imac G4 on system 10.4Maybe my machine (a hand me down) is messed up, but install was not very easy and my screens looked different than the screens they show in the guide. Did get it running and it does connect, but once I start a browser I can bring up one or two pages, after that any browser I try seems to loose connection and does not find any websites anymore. Restart gets me the same result, one or two sites show up, then nothing but searching and errors.Tech support is not very helpful and takes days to answer even on ""high"" priority. I can't make sense of this problem, neither can they I guess, so it'll go back."
557,"This seemed like such a clever little doo-dad, and I was so happy to have it in my home here in Los Angeles. It must've liked being here too, because it decided to adopt the laid-back Southern California lifestyle and stop working entirely. Doesn't charge a thing, not through any cable nor plugged into any socket. Pity, too, as it's small and handy."
558,"I bought this shutter release because the reviews said that it works for the Nikon D3100, but after receiving the product it was obvious that it wouldn't if into the port. As a owner of the D90, D5100 and D3100, I tried this shutter release on all of them with no luck. The plug on the shutter release is WAY smaller than the port on all 3 Nikon DSLRs. At the end I returned the product. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT it doesn't work."
559,"Falls off the camera ALL the time.  It may be no worse than OEM Canon, but is sure useless to me.  Cost more to send back than to just toss it away.  Don't make my mistake."
560,"I really wanted to like this item; it seemed like a great solution since I already have stands lying around. The problem is that the holes on the joint (where you are supposed to slide the stand & arm poles through) are too wide; this results in you not being able to tighten the arms to hold your reflector in place. The arm holding my reflector easily slides off the joint even after I have tightened it all the way. Does not fit standard sized stands, I will be returning."
561,"Dead on arrival ! ....the seller of the item I bought it from is excellent ,the product IS NOT and it  did not work at all !.. I try , if at all possible ,not to buy anything made in China because I doubt that they have any quality control...sony products used to be very reliable..not any anymore . I'll be returning this garbage back to Company A."
562,It is ridiculous that the stero came without a rear screw bolt (the one used for support). To save a nickle?My old one does not match with the nut hole. So bad I have been wasting my time waiting for this item.
563,"I barely used this card at all, maybe shot 50 photos or so, and it's already giving me problems. So unreliable I just won't use it anymore, I shot photos and they never get written to it. Worst SD card I've ever owned."
564,"I bought two of these for my awesome Polaroid Battery Pack on my Canon 5D MkII. What a waste of money. The two last LESS than ONE original Canon Battery. I even tried them individually, just in case it was the Battery Pack's fault. No, they just suck... that's all. Now I'll have to buy the original Canon batteries, which is what I should've done in the first place.I would return them if the international shipping costs weren't higher than the battery themselves (I'm in South America)."
565,"This controller is not good at all, its way to big and my hands are small. Ps3 controller is for more superior and durable. I had my ps3 controller for 15 years and it didnt break. While i had my xbox 360 controller for 1 year. So you should buy a ps3 or ps4 for the best controller for gaming"
566,"I am a Garmin fan.  This is my 4th and with the unlimited map updates (the reason for the purchase) I was fairly certain one of my last.  This product however is simply sub par.Cons:It CONSTANTLY has locating problems.  I live in Fredericksburg Va and Go to DC and Richmond, how can there possibly be a problem obtaining signal and locating the unit?  I'm not on back country roads, I'm 5 miles from I-95.  I have literally driven in random directions for up to 10 minutes before the Garmin finds itself.  I have found that the best way to make it work is to turn it off and on several times.  My old Garmin (205w) was able to locate me in 20 seconds.  The search option is sub par.  This morning I searched for a place 5 miles away from me, I even inserted the city the store was located in.  It found 3 of them...15+ miles away.  I pulled out my blackberry and located the store in seconds.Pro's:Size is nice, and the touch screen seems to be behaving better than previous modelsthe features are a nice upgrade from the less expensive Garmin's I have had in the pastshipped quickly (but I am a prime member)I have been sorely disappointed with this product.  In a market quickly turning over to smart phones I expected better from a stand alone GPS system.  I guess I was right, this will be my last Garmin."
567,"The device broke down in 8 months. It took a 30 mins wait time with Garmin customer service, and the representative told me that in this situation there is nothing they can do. I had to ship the device back with my own expense and they offered me a ""refurbished"" device with 3 months warranty on it. I don't know what is the future of this refurbished device, but I am not so confident. Also if something goes wrong, the charge to fix an issue is $110 + ~$10 for shipping. Wonderful! $120 to fix a $149 device. This is what happens when there is no competition in the market. I hope someone rises to stop this."
568,"I bought the unit in Costco, first 2 trips, it worked good, then after three month, it started shutdown by itself.  Too bad, I cannot return to Costco,  send the repair request to Garmin, never receive any response from them.  Now it sits in my drawer.  Shame on you Garmin! do not know whats going on with the company, used to be so good."
569,"Garmin Nuvi LMT 1450 almost got me arrested in the first day of use. Here's the story. I researched GPS units for days then selected this unit based on the usual set of features, price and performance. It is in the moderate range of cost. Company A sent it fairly quickly and I noticed that it had a 2009 software date so I had to upload or download new software to update the unit. It didn't take that long on my computer as I have a fiber connection in the house. then I did a practise run to the gym. The unit couldn't find my gym. It routed me around some crazy way. Using a GPS for the first time is very unnerving with some box telling you where to go. (So practise a few times before going out into serious traffic.)Then I went to another part of town for a program (I live in metro DC) and this required moving around the DC beltway. By the time I arrived, I was a nervous wreck. The unit would indicate a left turn and the voice would say turn right. I started to figure out there must be something wrong with it. (Initially I had to call Garmin 3 times to get the satellite to recognize my house). Anyway, coming home late that night from a show a police man stopped me and said, ""Are you drinking because you going all over the road?"" ""No, I don't drink. This is my first day with a GPS"". The unit didn't recognize streets in a section of my town which had been built for 6 years. The next business day I sent the unit back and called Garmin to give them hell. They said they have quality control but if Company A keeps the units in a hot warehouse they can go bad. After that I started to use the GPS on my cell phone which works great."
570,"This unit is frustrating at best.  The maps app in your smart phone is way better.  This thing is dangerous to use while driving, the interactions with it require another person in the vehicle.  I found it didn't know where it was often and couldn't find basic things (like gas) nearby.A smart phone with a maps and gas buddy apps is so much more usefull!  You can turn the voice on and let her tell you where to go.  I will store this thing with my 8-tracks and turntable in the basement.  Unless you want to buy one cheap?"
571,"You should know that the unit displays **Advertisements** while you drive.Who has the best Pizza?  Want a discount coupon for some burgers?  Click here!  Switch to another screen to read more about this fabulous deal.Want your kids doing this while they drive?  Is it any benefit to you?Garmin doesn't want you to enter navigation directions while you drive (it's dangerous!) but they have no objections to presenting you with fast food discount coupons to look at.These Ads appear on the screen every few minutes in metro areas, blocking the map display, and there is no way to get rid of them.I find them maddening.  I've read elsewhere that all the Garmin Nuvi's do this.Consider purchasing another brand."
572,"I bought this garbage webcam right when it came out, I've tried to get it to work on 3 different pc's and other than the 1st time I used it I've never gotten it dom a damn thing! The cam says its on, lights up and projects no image at all! I called hp and told them of the p[roblems I was having and they insisted that I was doing something wrong, so I had a tech specialist out to my place to see what I was doing wrong. Well I wasn't doing anything wrong, the software that comes with the cam is ridiculously confusing, and mmost of it had nothing to do with the cam! I have 2 hp computers and an acer, this cam is a total waste of your money and I'd steer clear of it!"
573,"Died quickly. I've never had a flash drive just stop working. I've read of others having this happen but it was always in the back of my mind that they were not being completely forthcoming about the circumstances. After all, what really kills a flash drive? Over voltage, getting wet, disconnecting without ejecting, some other extreme situation? None of those apply here as far as I know. After using it several times over a roughly two week period, it is no longer recognized by my win7 machine or mac. It isn't recognized by my car stereo or a Sony Dash. I tried using a disk utility to find and restore it but no luck. I've always had good luck with Corsair and Sandisk drives. Never had one fail and one of the Corsairs is approximately 5 years old with many miles on it so to speak. Argh. Not worth my time to try and return it. Once burned, twice shy."
574,"There is an odd pulsing sound as you try to tune it in.The tuner itself cannot find a station as it seems like the internal tuning mechanism moves so fast there is no way to lock on.When you do finally lock onto a strong local station, it looses the station quickly.The weather band does not get a single station.AM does not pick up anything as well.Returned both of them right away."
575,"The Sanoxy 3 port HDMI switcher was defective right out of the box. It was a big disapointment and a waste of money. The switcher was mailed from Hong Kong to my home. Due to the method it was received I felt it would be a losing battle to get another one. I was disapointed in the part and the vendor. This is my first experience over the past eight years, having a bad outcome when buying from Company A. I will attempt to contact the supplier of the switcher....but I will probally lose on this one."
576,"All of my devices were constantly losing wifi signal. Since I've been working from home, I use a voip telephone, and the connection was absolutely horrendous. I returned the item and bought a separate modem and router, and it's made a world of difference."
577,"Do not waste your money. Fast speed, right!!! 10X slower than 8 year old 'nothing' modem which it replaced.You will pay a lot of money for this and on top the 'darling' customer service wants to charge $30 just to assist in changing the password. Robbers!!! Too bad I don't have a -10 to rate their customer support.  Only ones they're supporting is their own pockets."
578,"When Android was first released to market, it was raw, but was not as raw as GoogleTV. This mainly because a lot of the hope for content did not make it and also the software was raw/buggy/featureless. With the avg going rate for a media player today ($99~149), GoogleTV's price tag is certainly way too high. I tried out both Sony and Logitec's GoogleTV, if I really have to pick a less rotten egg out of the two, i would go with Logitec's mainly because they give you a full keyboard w/ mouse to control the system and web on TV. On another hand, Sony's PS3 controller like QWERTY remote with the optical finger pointer sensor for mouse was just hard to use and hard to pin point a specific point when you are browsing the websites.Bottom line is, unless you like to play with early science project from big corp, don't waste your money. However, I do think if Google can actually get all things in place, achieve the expectations of what this platform can really do, and bring down the price point, then this science project can become a real deal which revolutionize the way we watch TV."
579,"i hve had my apple brand cables for years and they still work,, Ive had 2 of these cables for 1 month and both of them are breaking at the ends where the cable goes into the connector... these were not very cheap,, but the quality shure is,, not happy,, i wouldnt buy this product if I was you,,, waste of 35 bucks..."
580,"I have repeatedly emailed Lenovo to get a simple question answered regarding my Lenovo computer and all I get is that I should call a 1-800 number. I have called and gave up after being on hold forever. I regret ever having bought a Lenovo computer and will never buy another one.While it might be a good machine, if you ever need service, have a question or have a problem, talk to a tree as you would have a better chance of getting an answer."
581,"Ok I literally just got this. First off it was great as it paired with my phone. Didnt get it to pair with both phones simultaneously but now worries. Anyway made a couple calls to test it worked ok, then I noticed that the calls sounded choppy, figured I needed to charge it. (note that based on the instructions in the manual the first thing you need to do is charge it, which I did until the light changed to green). So I was a bit surprised that I needed to charge it.Note however, that the charger was a tight fit. It doesnt go in easy like something isnt right. Anyway, I pluged it back in to charge and guesss what, it doesnt charge. I have been sitting here waiting and I dont see any lights to indicate that it is charging (red or yellow) and the phone isnt finding it also because it is dead.I was soooooo looking forward to this device but it now its just a total load of garbage.Sigh."
582,Hoping it would be compatible like the product description had mentioned I was completely disappointed. I had used a previous one and it only lasted 6 months and the warranty is useless. I took a leap of faith to buy a second unit but was let down when using standard migration and reformatting this unit would not work. I could get zero help from the factory or the seller but the did credit me back quickly.
583,"I really needed a case for my new iPod Touch 4, so I tried this one, but it's horrific! The case does not fit snugly, it slides out within moments, almost like it's too snug. The screen protector has adhesive backing and it very difficult to put back on. I am going to ask for a refund. I really regret this purchase!"
584,"Lasted three months, Anker does not make replacement, refunded money, bought http://www.Company A.com/Company C-E6400asb-Company J-Company B-Company F/dp/B004VRKSSM slim version has been working well since. Booo."
585,I'm no dummy when it comes to computers and electronics.  Worked with tech support for over an hour.  No luck.  Would not link up.  Stay away.
586,"and I was very anxious to get it set up and start using it, but I couldn't even get it to show *anything* on the tv, and the little purple light was barely visible. I couldn't test it in any way, and I'm extremely disappointed. And, this after waiting 5 days for a 2 day delivery. Company A refunded the fees for the 2 day delivery, but it didn't help get it here any quicker. (sigh)I don't want to go through this again with another Roku, so I returned it (and the hdmi cable I bought with it) for a refund.I think I'm going to go with something a bit more versatile and get a Tivo. I just don't trust Roku any more, and from what I've been reading in the reviews, I'm not the only one unhappy with them... it's a simple machine - why can't they get it right???!!!!!"
587,"This is an update to the review below.  I tried again to use this camera and give it a second chance.  It continually froze up and had to be turned off and turned back on.  The zoom feature is worthless and the view finder is poor.  You will not be happy with this camera and I suspect that the P7100 is equally flawed.  My recommendation is to look at the Fuji X10 or the Canon G12.  The Fuji seems to be better than either the Nikon or Canon.Below is my first review of this camera.  After using it for some time, I wish I could send it back.Lens does not focus well.  Writes raw files slowly. Zoom often does not work and camera must be turned off. Occasionally, camera freezes and must be reset.  This camera is a mediocre point and shoot that is supposed to rival the excellent Canon Company G. It fails and I would think carefully before buying.  Below is my first review; after using for some months, the same problems still bother me.Before you purchase, I suggest that you read an article by Thom Hogan comparing Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic.  It is quite complete and discusses issues that are mentioned in other comments here.  His issues with this camera are serious and he is a Nikon user.I have used Nikon cameras for over thirty years and have been waiting for Nikon to produce a good point and shoot that would rival the Canon Company G.  The P7000 may be a very good camera; I am not sure yet as I believe that my particular camera may be defective.  Company A has already sent me a replacement.I found that the telephoto zoom lever did not work all the time and did not go into extended mode at all.  I had to reset the camera to get the extended mode to work.  I did get help in resolving this issue from Nikon.I believe that there may be a focusing problem with this camera and others have reported similar findings.  I tried a series of close up images and almost none of them are in focus.I agree with those who have commented on the poor quality of the manual and want to add that much of the print is almost too small to read.  The small print is lighter than the regular size print.I am hopeful that my replacement camera will work well as others have commented on how much they like this camera.Buyers should be aware that the new Nikon raw files are not yet compatible with any Adobe products.I want to keep an eye out for other reviews to see if the problems that I have had are peculiar to me or if they are real problems with the camera. As of Dec 8th, it appears that the problems are real.I have continued to have problems with focusing at close distances.The camera is slow particularly when shooting raw.  There is now a beta upgrade from Adobe that I believe includes this Nikon raw format.There are rumors that the camera needs a firmware update.  While I have kept the camera, in retrospect I wish that I had waited until Nikon made necessary improvement for this camera.Dec 22 - The firmware update has been released but it does not solve all the problems.  Adobe has released Camera Raw for this camera for both Lightroom and Photoshop.  HOWEVER Nikon does not seem to support its own product.  I have tried to open with Capture NX2 and the files will not open.I have kept the camera but I would strongly recommend that others wait before buying this camera."
588,"a very slow server.  I wound up returning it to Company A and went with one from synology for a little more.  Much faster and more reliable.  This one had overheating issues when faced with large file transfers.  Poor design, I should have listened to the other reviews but I took a chance because the price point was so good."
589,"I bought this after buying a different one from the same company that had failed (the 300 Watt version).This one failed, too. It just took longer (but not long enough). 3 month lifespan for this? Seriously? What is up with all these companies who can't make electronics. This is not a complicated device.It worked fine at first. I only ever removed the SD card a few times over the lifespan to view videos. The last time I had checked it, I noticed that some of the video recordings were corrupted, and figured its time was near. I was right. Next time I had checked for videos, nothing had been recorded.Buy this product if you want a $160 motion light in a few months, because the camera portion is certainly shaky at best."
590,"Don't buy this. You'll regret it. Simply put, it's cheap and doesn't work. If it works for you, just wait."
591,"I bought this camera because I do a lot of webchatting.  This picture is very sharp, but if you move, then the camera re-focuses and it take 2-3 seconds which is very distracting.  I'm not impressed with the poor autofocus feature and I'm returning mine.I'm ordered the Logitec HD camera, which is real HD, unlike what this model ""claims"" to be."
592,"Well, first two times I used, It was great it last for 12+ hours of flight.but When I pull this item again to used. charge for 6hours.chack the battey life. 2 light. charge other 3hours, now is one bar.I felt something is wrong so I deside to charge my iphone.charging for good 30 second and dead.I try to charge and do not work..."
593,"I have a HP G60-530US and the battery falls out of my laptop. It lists this model in the description, but is obviously false...It is not worth it to return since it was so cheap. Will probably just use duct tape to keep it in..."
594,"Right out of the box, the modeling light/lamp did not work.I like the strobe/flash, but since it was not shipped/sold straight from Company A.com, there is no replacement, only a refund.For that amount of trouble, and since I will have to pack it up, pay for shipping, and return it for a refund, I may as well just keep the darn thing.The strobe/flash works fine in that function, would be very happy with it otherwise. It's just no modeling lamp/light.Makes me worried about future failure of other functions.Don't know if I will buy another one.Maybe check out another brand, and this time make sure that it's shipped/sold from Company A.comI don't think that's right, if it's &#34;Fullfilled&#34; by Company A.com, then all the return/replacement rights should apply.Gregg HutchingsEditor/PublisherModel Cars Magazine"
595,"I've been using Logitech trackballs for years and find them wonderful to use.  When my last red ball model finally wore out I needed to replace it.  This time, they created a looser!  Using the thumb to move the ball around is cumbersome at best and overall impossible to use.  Call it $60 I tossed out the window.  I only get burned once so this is the last time I'll buy a Logitech product.  They lost my trust.  It might look good, but I don't think you'll find it easy to use."
596,Then it would be almost as good as my iPhone. The image quality is about the same. Not sure what you all are raving about but this is the nicest Panasonic camera on Company A.
597,"Wouldn't it be great to charge your phone by using a solar cell?Don't get this product. Won't charge your phone from 1% to 2% even in direct strong midday sun.The internal battery will never go about 50% on solar recharge, must be plugged in to reach 100%.The best I got this product to perform was to maintain battery life on a iPhone 5.Would not buy again."
598,"I got this laptop hoping for a great machine, and was sorely disappointed. I had to exchange it twice, because both models overheated and shut down, causing me to lose all the data I had installed, and causing me hours and hours of time in reinstalling programs. After the second one overheated, and I cried a little, I returned it and got a MacBook Pro. It has been worth every single penny.  Please don't get this laptop - it will break your heart (and possibly give you a 3rd degree burn)"
599,"I bought this over a year ago to be my Wifi hub for all of my devices (basically a laptop and a PS3 at the time, it's expanded to also includde a PS4 and smart tv since) when I changed my internet providers and didn't want to rent their equipment. It wasn't long before the dropped signals started. At least once a day, and more like 3 or 4 times a day if I'm home all day using the internet, I have to get up and reset it. Now I know some people would say that it is my awesome Crap-cast internet but I know it isn't because I could be on my laptop about 5 feet from the router, lose signal, get up and go to my desktop (which was physically connected with a wire) and use the internet with no problem. Now the only reason I haven't got around to replacing it (which is about to happen) is because I am generally home so little that I don't get to worked up about it and I'll just take a break from whatever I'm doing and either let it sit and think about what it's done or get up and unplug it and put it in time out. I will say though that it can be quite frustrating when you're trying to play a game with friends online, stream Netflix, or do something important online (like using StumbleUpon or Facebook stalking).Now with all that said I will say this; there are some pros to using this particular router.1) You will learn to become very patient, so this probably could be used as a parenting tool or as a way to teach kids patience.2) If you need exercise you can put this as far away from where you intend to use your internet and count the miles you walk in a week as you go back and forth to reset it.3) Now here is the biggest pro, and I think this is how they should start to advertise this piece of equipment: &#34;Medialink Blinking Blue Light Space Ship Nightlight&#34;. This is what I intend to do with it when I finally get a new router (I'm looking for suggestions if anyone has any) because it literally lights up my whole living room, even more so than the soft glow of all my devices' blank screens reading, &#34;unable to find signal&#34;."
600,"It failed to detect my home wifi signal which is quite strong.  When attempting to access the video from the manufacturer's website, one computer worked fine but other computers on the same home network seemed to be unable to access, even though they had internet connectivity and the same login credentials.  Very strange and not worth  my time to debug all these problems."
601,"Tried everything, it shows up but can't recognize a drive plugged into it. I only rate it because in forums people discuss how to get it to work with MAC OSx and obviously that is wrong. Also the included drivers are on a tiny CD and can't find the official drivers to download anywhere. If you are purchasing for a PC and have a standard pop out CD reader then this could work for you."
602,"Poor build quality with cheap materials, especially buttons.  terrible screen.  No apps to speak of.  Honeycomb OS is buggy with a terrible interface.  I don't know why anyone would buy this instead of an iPad 2 unless they were some sort of Android zealot.."
603,"I am a network technician and the only thing that gave me gratification is when I SMASHED this POS router with a hammer and replaced it with a router that was half the cost.  I enjoyed smashing this crappy router because it would drop wireless, it would drop the internet, it would never reconnect unless i sat there for 20 minutes holding its hand.  All I can say is if you want a router that sucks that you can smash, this is your router."
604,"The camera works fine, but Company A's website description is designed to increase revenue since they leave out very important info. You MUST disable MAC filtering and you MUST broadcast your SSID (that is in the instructions!). These are both security features this product requires you to disable to use the camera. Unacceptable. Period.Also watch out for many of the positive reviews. They have common grammar and other similar writing characteristics that clearly indicate they are FAKE reviews. This company is paying people to make their bad product look good. Buyer beware!At least Company A allows you to return products that do not live up to their marketing...buy elsewhere and you will likely be stuck with something you did not intend to buy."
605,"My mission: find a silent/very quiet PSU for under $100.I have been through quite a few PSUs in the last month or so (if you search through my Company A reviews you will see them all). All have had noise or fan issues. A previous Antec (TP-650) unit I had tried (see review) had a high-pitched squeal coming from it after the first day of use. I called Antec, and the 'support' person told me that that unit has had issues, depending on the manufacturing date- mine was one of those problem units. He recommended I return it to Company A and get this model. So, I did, even though there were no reviews to rely on.The unit installed without difficulty. It started right up. The high pitched noise appeared on the second day. I tried to ignore it. The next day, the clicking noise from the PSU fan began. I couldn't get the unit out of my case fast enough. I really don't need to have the fan fail and fry my system.This has been the third (and last) Antec PSU I will try. While some others seem quite pleased with their Antec units, I have decided to go another way and try Cooler Master.Keeping my fingers crossed..."
606,"Sadly, this literally stopped working the day after Company A's return period expired.  It still plays sound, but will not charge my iPod.  Very disappointed!  :-("
607,I have tried to use this several times and it has not worked at all. I bought a different kind at the same time and it works great. Possible operator error but I don't think so because I have had no trouble using the other brand.

609,"I bought this laptop on black friday sale as part of lightening deal. The original description and product image showed that it had built-in mic and webcam. I just received it today and as others reviewers mentioned, it doesn't have cam/mic. I called Company A customer service twice and they offered me a $20 credit towards purchase of a webcam or return the item. This is not an acceptable resolution to this incident. I want Company A to take this back and give me another laptop with same/similar specs because I could buy similar item from some other online store on black friday but are not longer available at this time (at that price). Since they are refusing to do so, I would like to take legal actions. Post a reply to my review if anyone is interested in taking legal actions."
610,"Believe it or not, this USB DVD player is not supported by the iMac!!  A USB device!!  Why in this world Apple would do such a thing defies any sort of reasoning.  So, I can purchase a third party USB DVD drive and it will work fine, but Apple's own USB drive does not work?  Astounding.  Return to Company A.  For those who would say that the item is labeled as a ""Macbook Air"" Superdrive, well that logic does not apply since the newer Mac Minis do not have a DVD drive and Apple recommends the purchase of this item for use with those Macs.  One would think that it would work with other Macs as well.  Nope.  Does not work with iMac or Macbook Pro.  That is simply stupid."

612,"I bought those to use it in my smallhd monitor. Batteries don't hold charge. I charged night before the shoot. Once we start filming one pair died immediately, another lasted for about hour and a half, third batteries where just dead......So 6 batteries total, and they all malfunctioning...."
613,"UPDATE: I continue to uncover new issues that have cropped up on my home network after switching to the RT-N56U - some of them very serious (like abysmal NAS network performance and my AT&T; MicroCell not functioning).  So my opinion has gone from ""expected more"" to ""this thing has serious issues"".Based on all of the great reviews here I had high expectations for the ASUS Black Diamond Dual Band Wireless-N 600 Router (RT-N56U).  After just receiving and setting up the router here are the things I'm disappointed with:- No ability to see how much bandwidth each client is actually using.  With the Traffic Monitor (strangely located in the EzQos tab) I can see total bandwidth usage but there isn't a way to drill down to see how each client is using bandwidth.  I felt this would be possible based on some of the marketing literature and is actually a big reason why I purchased the router.- The configuration switching between the Wireless 2.4GHz and 5Ghz is just silly and confusing.- Configuring MAC address filtering for my wireless networks was really painful.  I had to enter each MAC address in a non-standard format AND enter them individually AND enter them for both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.- I plugged in my Verizon 4G Mifi and configured it but it didn't seem to do anything.  Was it secretly being used?  Does it only get used if my DSL goes down?  This feature definitely needs some explanation / improvement.- There isn't support for HFS+ or AFP so the USB drive sharing can't really be used as a backup target for Mac Time Machine.- Getting a Cisco VPN client to work took some extra configuration and wasn't well documented.- I haven't been able to get my AT&T; MicroCell working when connected to the RT-N56U.- My ReadyNAS is extremely slow with the wired connection.  I haven't been able to figure out why but this wasn't a problem on my previous router."
614,"It's a mystery how this router gets all the terrific reviews.  I spent oceans of time trying to get it to ""sparkle"" like everyone says it does.  New firmware, tweaking and tuning.  I expected at at least as good as my old single band router.I give up.  Drops 2.4 and 5Ghz connections constantly, almost -never- gets ""excellent"" connection, mostly ""good"" or ""fair.""  It won't connect at all to my wireless printer.  I had to reconnect my Roku's -every- time I used them.  My g connections speed fluctuated all over the place, my Plex and Playon servers are now useless.Also, it is INSULTING that some of the help panels are in poor and confusing English.Back in the box it goes, and I'm going back to my trusty (old) DIR-615.Uncle Ron"
615,"Got mine from 47St. photo New York, broken pieces inside, on/off switch not functioning and now I have to pay for postage to send it back, why I did not get a real canon product from a reputable outlet close to where I reside I have no idea, I will never again purchase any item where I can't walk in and have it replaced."
616,"First of all, I bought these because of what they are -&#62; clamps!  No need to spend tons on clamps, which I use in my garage studio anyway.  But seriously what is that plastic smell!  And the quality is obviously low grade.  Better to get better clamps at a hardware store."
617,"I guess you get what you pay for.  I thought I was getting a good deal, paid about $4.00 delivered.  Unfortunately, it isn't worth that.  As soon as I put it on my iPod, I knew it wasn't going to work for me.  Threw it in the garbage, and immediately ordered a different case.  Instead of a great deal, it just cost me time and money.  Do yourself a favor, and pay a little more for a case that's higher rated."

621,"This light is perfectly designed for reading a Kindle in low light conditions, like in bed. It fits securely and out of the way on the top of the Kindle, it washes the entire screen just the right amount of illumination, and one charge lasts for hours and hours. The swing-out arm is really cool. I found recharging the light by connecting to my computer annoying, but then discovered that the wall charger for my Kindle also charges this Verso light. Using the wall charger is much more convenient, and it's easy to pack it when traveling. I recommend this product.Update, 8/20/12:As badly as I hate to, I must update this review and report that in the past year I have grown disappointed in this light. It is unreliable. Even after charging, it will sometimes not work, but at other times work perfectly. There seems little rhyme nor reason to its reliability. In retrospect, I would choose another product."

630,"Updated Dec 2011:So, I just discovered that Synology is EXTREMELY misleading (personally, I feel it falls in the ""fraudulent"" category), regarding the support for Video Surveillance on this NAS.  All of the marketing pages and specs talk about the amazing Surveillance Station software and the NAS support for up to 20 IP cameras.  What they don't talk about ... is when you actually go try to enable this functionality ... you only get support for 1 camera for free (that's right, 1) ... and every additional camera you want to add to the software costs you sixty dollars!  You literally have to purchase a new ""license"" for each camera.  Totally unacceptable that this information was so buried (I only found it inside the software itself.).  And in general, an incredibly negative experience with Synology.  Who would ever expect to have to pay a fee for every extra camera you added?  It's like Microsoft charging you sixty dollars every time you want to add a printer to your computer!****************October, 2011:I've had this server up and running for about 4 months now, and while many of the features I still LOVE (as covered by other reviewers) ... I wanted to call out one area that has is noticeably weaker than expected, which might affect your purchase decision.I previously had a Windows Home Server NAS ... great in many ways ... but one of the major shortcomings was the inability to adequately back up the server itself.  (This is really important if you are using it as a primary file server for your home, not just as a backup for other Desktop or Laptop computers.)The Synology servers claim significant capabilities in this area of server backup ... but I wanted to call out a few deficiencies that are not clear until you start using it:1) Backup Status/History - The information provided about a given backup is VERY weak.  The system basically tells you if the most recent attempt succeeded or failed.  But a single file issue (such as 1 file not readable) will result in a ""failed"" status for the whole backup ... and it is then impossible to tell if the whole backup needs to be repeated, or if it's just the issue with the one file.  I have a 3TB server, so having to repeat the backup can be a 2day+ affair.2) Data Replicator and Server Backup Collision ... Synology provides desktop/laptop software called Data Replicator that backups up the files from your desktop/laptop onto the server itself.  However, it appears that if you include these desktop/laptop backups in the server backup job itself, there will be a file access collision, which means you are never able to run both a local and a server backup job at the same time.  MAJOR issue, since I generally need to run all the backup jobs overnight, since they take so much time and resources.3) Backups are VERY slow ... I do a nightly backup of about 1TB of my most critical server data each night.  This backup is over a gigabit network to another Synology server located locally.  This takes almost 16 hours!  My full server capacity is about 3 TB, which means I would never be able to do a nightly backup of the full server, as it would not finish even within 24 hours.4) Backup to eSATA is VERY messy ... backing up to an external eSATA drive is a major requirement for me, so that I can have offsite backups as well as on site backups.  The Synology software, however does not recognize individual eSATA drives, and instead uses the same volume name for ALL eSATA drives, no matter what actual drive is plugged in.  Since any server backup is almost certainly going to require more than 1 eSATA drive (since the server holds 5 drives), this is a MAJOR issue.  It means, for example, that Synology server cannot tell what actual drive is attached at any given time, and therefore cannot tell which backup job is appropriate for that drive.  Without being extremely careful yourself ... it is very easy to start a backup job with the wrong drive attached, and thus the job will fail (because it fills up the disk with another job's data ... requiring you to come back and reformat the whole disk and start over.)5) External Drive format of EXT3 & EXT4 meaningfully supported ... the specs claim that Synology will backup to drives formatted in FAT32 and NTFS ... however, once you delve into the performance specs for these formats, you see that backing up to these formats takes SIGNIFICANTLY longer than to EXT3 and EXT4  (like 2-3 times as long).  The times I mentioned earlier in this review are for backing up to EXT4.  So, unless you have very little data (less than 1TB) ... or you are ok taking multiple days to backup your data ... you will need to use EXT3 or EXT4 formats.  This means that your backups will NOT be readable natively by a PC if you need to access your data.  If you are familiar with these linux fomats or are just planning to restore your Synology server using the backups, this won't be a problem for you.  But if you were expecting to be able to access your files directly from the backup without fully restoring your server, this may pose a problem.6) Backup to Company A takes WAAAAAAY too long ... I'm not sure of the problem here ... I decided to just stop trying to use the Company A backup solution.  Even after I did my initial backup of critical data to Company A (too 3 days for about 100GBs), all of the incremental backups seems to take just as long.  This should not be the case, as each incremental backup should only require uploading the changed files since the last backup.  I may try again, but for now, it looks virtually useless given the speeds.Still an amazing server on many other dimensions, and very glad I got it.  But I'm definitely not thrilled with the less than stellar support for an easy server backup solution."
631,"I bought this product on Prime for about eight bucks. I feel like a sucker buying it! I followed the directions and still ended up with bubbles, creases and an unusable screen. I pulled it off and threw it away. Company A should pull this product from their store; Its cheap junk from China. DO NOT BUY!"
632,"I'm a big fan of Razer mice; the DeathAdder is easily one of the most comfortable and accurate bare-bones mice I've ever owned, and the Naga is something every MMO gamer should give a try. I picked up this Anansi to replace a dying Logitech G15, expecting something of similar quality and usability, but unfortunately after a day of using it I'd have to say it's one of the worst gaming products I've ever bought.The good:The software is easy to set up, and works very well; it's familiar to anyone who's used the Naga, as the macro and customization is mostly identical. The backlight on the board is also really nice, and allows you to customize the color it displays in the same as the backlighting on Company F's laptops.The bad:Everything else.The modifier keys would be useful, but they're not easily reachable and are sectioned off in a way that offers no tactile feedback as to which you're actually hitting. They're also the only part of the keyboard that isn't backlit, and they really need to be. Unfortunately, I just can't see them being really useful; same with the modifier keys on the far left of the board, which have the same problem as those on the Logitech gaming boards...they're just not in the path of anything that makes them fast enough to hit accurately when playing a game.The sticky key complaints are the biggest factor, though, and it's absolutely inexcusable for a gaming board to have this problem. I only used the board for two days, and had enough frustration with keys being stuck on a function after hitting with another key that I was fed up almost instantly with the keyboard. This just should not happen on a gaming keyboard. It doesn't happen on a $20 OEM board that's made for business use, so on a $100 board designed for gaming... if it was very occasional, or rare, maybe I could deal with it but not multiple times per gaming session. It's too hard to recommend a keyboard with the problems this has for any price."
633,"Very disappointed. Case does not fit iPad 2. Doesn't hold it in place, iPad is falling out the case. Definitelly I am returning it."
634,"I watched this because it got 4 stars.  However, the plot was forgettable, the acting questionable, and the ending suggested a sequel, which apparently never got made.  It was a waste of time."
635,"I tried to use this with my ipad 2 and it says on screen ""this device is not compatible with the ipad"" even though that's the whole reason I bought it."
636,"Bought a refurb directly from Canon.  Had it for one month, but only used it for less than a week.  The lens barrier somehow gotten detached - no idea how it happened, as it wasn't dropped.  But Canon's warranty won't cover it, and wants to charge me over $50 to repair it.  Never buying Canon again."
637,"The reason they are selling such an advanced device for so little is that it's glitchy and difficult to use.  I've been using it for several months now and it even when it was new it stops letting you click anything and mouse gestures stop working I have to switch it off the back on to get it to work and I have to do this constantly.  Also when I try scrolling it's extremely sensitive on scrolls at a million miles per hour so I go way past where I wanted.  Many times it scrolls all over the place when I don't want it to scroll. The other gestures don't work most of the time either.  It's uncomfortable in my hand and make may hand sore after using it for an hour.  I've purchased other MS mice before and been very happy with them but this one is the worst mouse I've ever used.  I can't believe MS would put it's name on this product.  I would would highly discourage anyone from buying this product.  I have orders another MS mouse the ""Microsoft 2.4GHz Wireless BlueTrack Technology Laser Explorer Mouse with 30-Foot Range and Easy Battery Recharging Base (5AA-00001)"" I already own one and it's one the best I've ever used very comfortable in my hand.  I need 2 mice because I have 2 computers and a laptop.  I order the mini mouse with blue track for the laptop and it's a very good mouse as well.  This one though falls short though.  Don't buy unless you want carpal tunnel syndrome."
638,This is an actual piece of garbage.  It has a plastic connector that is normally metal.  The whole thing it cheap plastic and only a matter of a short time before it breaks.  I returned it immediately.  Could not believe they would even attempt to make something this cheaply and expect it to be reliable.  It's actually better off in the trash can.
639,"Pros: Having owned three IMP500 5000mAH packs for a year, when the case~combo for iPad came out I got to have it.  My IMP500 traveled with me to China and never failed to provide full charge at least twice (went nuts shooting digital pictures with iPhone 4!)Although the iPad2 fits there is a slight slack due to it being thinner than iPad (1).  Not an issue for me as a piece of Velcro on the back (the curly hook) of iPad2 took care of it.  The battery is powerful like the IMP500's and charges overnight if completely exhausted.  Topping it off depends on level of depletion.  The battery is super slim, like iPad2 and light too (surprise!).  It fits snugly and secure inside the flap pocket opposite of iPad's.  Having an on/off switch is a nice touch provided the user remembers to turn it off.  That's what the bright, green LED is for.  The flashing LED display for charging status is a nice touch too.Cons: (actually, improvement suggestion)  Wish there is a tab like the magnetic case closure for preventing iPad2 from sliding out (again the Velcro thing mentioned earlier).  Or have the opening facing left (battery pocket opening faces right) while leaving three opening for headphone jack, on/off switch and one tiny one that I've yet to discover for, on iPad2) on top of pocket.  No camera holes but that can be easily fixed in the new version specifically for iPad2's front and rear-facing camera.I wish they include an AC adapter for charging although the Apple 2.1 amp charger that comes with iPad/iPad2 works fine for faster charging.  Also like the iDual-port IMP50D it would be nice if the charging input socket is standard mini USB instead of legacy round type.  A short charging cable included is held in place by two elastic bands though.  (I will probably lose it sooner or later)Extras: With an iPad2 the combo weighs 3.2 lbs (includes the white Apple supplied USB charging cable).  Case material feels and smells like leather although I'm not sure it is real leather, it feels good to the touch due to padding inside. Good shock absorbance if it gets dropped.  (Nowadays, genuine leather looks and feels like faux leather that looks and feels like - leather! - go figure! :-) )For the price, it's a no-brainer.  Other big-name brands charge a premium for lower battery capacity.  Although warranty is six months and 500 cycles, for my usage, 500 cycles is good for three or four years of use.Update: June 12, 2012: I only had to use it to charge my iPad2 maybe three times at the most.  For some reason the battery pan refused to hold a charge any more even though it was charged overnight.  Still waiting for NewTrent/IdeaPoint to address the issue.  Ditto the 5000 mAH pocket battery pak."
640,"We were loyal Garmin users, but when our last navigation system died, we figured we'd give TomTom a go (mainly because it was cheeper). BIG mistake. From the second we took it out of the box it was buggy. Then after 5 hours (yes 5 hours!!!) of updating we finally took it on the road. The entire item feels like it is in Beta Testing. Points of Interest show up with all sorts of formatting errors and alot of them are missing. Entire roads are wrong in the system, (it kept calling the street next to ours by a completely unrelated name) and certain safety noises (that are really distracting) could not be turned off no matter how hard I tried. The menus were clunky and it was nearly impossible to change any settings while the car was moving because it automatically locks the menus down with no override option. I understand that this could be safety feature, but I was working on it from the passenger seat. My husband's eyes never left the road.Promptly returned for a full refund, thanks to Company A's amazing customer service policies. Our new Garmin Nuvi is working great!If you do decide to buy one anyway, don't count on any of the cases fitting very well (even ones made by TomTom). Despite looking very flat in advertisements, the reality is that it has a giant mounting attachment sticking out the back that is NOT removable."
641,"This product didn't work for me at all.  It is specified to be 3 anti-glare/polarizing (and presumably 'protective') films for the screen on the Kindle 3G, 4 and Touch.  I have (and love!) the Kindle touch.  I generally keep it in a Built sleeve but know that my hands aren't always the cleanest when I handle it (okay, I read while I'm eating) and there are a few of my handbags into which the Built sleeve won't fit and you wouldn't expect me to leave my Kindle behind, right?  So, a protective film like the one on my work iPad and my smart phone seemed like a good idea.The presentation is usual -- there are ""covers"" on the front and back of the shield.  One is to pull cover 1 partway off, get the film positioned on the screen, then pull the cover 1 the rest of the way off.  A ""tool"" is provided to smooth out bubbles, then cover 2 is removed.The shield left about 1/32"" exposed at one end of my screen after I butted against the edge at the other end.  I didn't like that -- it seemed a place for debris to gather, for things to catch.  I suppose one could try to split the difference, but the tab one uses to hold and maneuver is at one corner of cover 1, so it is actually quite challenging to get the shield aligned at all, let alone 1/64"" away from the edge! The sides of the shield seemed to fit the screen nicely.However, my real problem was that I could NOT get the bubbles out from under the shield.  The ""tool"" is some stiff paper and it wilted rather quickly as I tried to smooth.  I resorted to the plastic tool that came with the Zagg Invisable Shield for the iPad, and it, too, didn't seem to get anywhere.  With the Zagg product, all the bubbles didn't come out initially, either, but one is instructed that it will ""cure"" overnight, and, sure enough, the next day I had a crystal clear protective film on the iPad.  I thought that, although it doesn't say anything about it, the GreatShield product might work the same way.  However, this morning, the shield was still bubbly.  I'm not sure how it would play with backlighting or color, but on the Kindle Touch, it made the print quite impossible to read under the bubbles.  So I peeled it back off.  Thankfully, it does come off easily, and is easy to ""start,"" given the space at the edge (which also makes me wonder how well it would stay on if one were able to leave it on).I hope others have better luck with this than I did."
642,"I got one of these directly from Woot (Woot accepted it as a return and gave my money back).  It may be the very worst product of any sort I have ever bought.  I seriously decided that I would never again buy anything labeled Sylvania.  (Here, let me close the door so I can tell you how bad I really think it is...)Pro - Very pretty until you tried to use it."
643,"If you buy this product you are not allowed to complain or raise any public opinion about this product, such an activity will unleash Media bridge lawyers upon you .This behavior is unacceptable and i will support your firm by moving my business elsewhereIn addition to all that above the cable does suck big time .I tried to use it in my car , but after a cold night it get so stiff and lose the elasticity .Which in turn put stress on the earphones jack on my phone and eventually broke it."
644,"I bought the Viera Plasma a little over a year ago.  It made a pop sound a few weeks back when turning it off, then the dreaded 4 blinks.Google'ing it, it appears to be the power board.  Researching it further shows many people are frustrated with this product and even more frustrated with the lack of customer support from Panasonic.My suggestion is get a different brand, read reviews by using Google and good luck to you.I feel ripped off and will never buy Panasonic again.Update:Some of the comments here were negative directed at the ""wrong product"".  It's Panasonic, and yes not the same model, but just trying to be helpful for others to make a wise decision.Good luck to all in making that Holiday or ""Superbowl"" decision when the time comes to get your new TV."
645,"I got this as a present and didn't buy it thu Company A BUT... I had not used it since Christmas day until a few days ago I decided to ""play"" with it and look and see what the reviews are online.  I found time after time they are having charging issues and they are so packed with options for each and every location your shooting at you go thru hell to get the setting just right to get good pictures. You press the button to take a picture and sometimes a picture is taken other times you can press that button til the battery is dead and STILL no picture gets taken.  My old trusty Cannon is 10 years old 1/3 the mega pixels blows the doors off this 14 mega pixels pile of dog poop. Since I got it as a Christmas present I wanted to return it since I read about all the issues. Cannon says no Wal Mart says no. So here I sit feeling cheated and used like a doormat.  YEA yea sure it may just be a few bad s4100's out there, but from what I am seeing it looks to me EVERY one of these are crapping out.. So I view it as getting into a car that has serious reliability issues on a long trip meaning I'm pretty sure if I REALLY needed to take a picture this camera is likely to die just when you need it the most.  My OLD cannon is now 10 years old and I have never even had it fail me in ANYWAY even ONCE.  I decided since my old camera is just so much better than most new cameras I bought 3 used and or refurbished ones.I not a penny wise pound foolish shopper and IF I was looking for a current model digital camera shopper I would have never bought this model and now that I was ""slapped in the face"" by Nikon when and if I do look for a new Camera NIKON is not getting my money.  Walmart gets my money ONLY for common household ""staple"" stuff. ARRRRRGGHHH!!!!"
646,"I had high hopes for this product, especially after reading all the favorable reviews. But as soon as I installed the DisplayLink software, all kinds of strange things started happening. My XP Home system slowed to a crawl and various processes hung with insufficient memory warnings. Normal system functions stopped working. Menus disappeared. All my installed programs disappeared from the Start menu programs list. Even my Firefox user profile was corrupted.After reading here that someone else had similar issues, I tried to uninstall the software. I thought I was being tortured by the PC gods because it was nearly impossible to get rid of it! Long story short, I was eventually able to uninstall DisplayLink after jumping through a bunch of hoops and uttering numerous expletives. Lo and behold, my system returned to normal except for a corrupted Firefox profile, which I was able to restore from backup.Needless to say, I'll be returning this product ASAP and seeking an alternative."
647,Yup. Crap. Ran for maybe a couple of hours before dying. Returned to Company A with no problem. Spend more money on a better PSU. Get one that's at least Bronze rated. Stay away from this thing.
648,"These headphones broke on me in about two months of occasional use. The area where the wire and the jack meets caused the headphones to malfunction.  I didn't pay much for these, and Skullcandy would have replaced them.  However, I just don't justify getting a box and paying $10 to ship it back.  I've had other bad experiences with Skullcandy products.  I'm done with them."
649,"The GO2535TM states in big letters on its box:1. WORLD TRAVELER EDITION. MAPS OF UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, AND EUROPE.2. LIFETIME TRAFFIC AND MAPS.A few months after I bought it (Serial number Serial # SM4442G02488) and tried to update the maps, the TomTom website informed me that my ""subscription has expired""; so much for ""lifetime traffic and maps"".I then contacted TomTom and, I received a reply by a ""Vanessa"" at TomTom customer support that ""we are unable to find Lifetime Map update Service active in your TomTom account"".I then provided them with a photograph of the box and its serial number.I then received another reply from the same lady telling me that ""I am glad to inform you that we have manually added USA, Canada and Mexico - Lifetime Map"". NO WORD ABOUT EUROPE MAPS which, as per above, are clearly included.I then complained again and this time I was emailed that ""If you wish to update the map of Europe, you can go ahead and PURCHASE the map of Europe with 1 year Map Update Service (MUS)""In my opinion, this is fraudulent advertising.Readers may want to make their own determination and act accordingly."
650,"I bought this Belkin to replace a D-Link DIR-655 that was giving me problems a couple times a month.This thing is the biggest piece of garbage router I have ever owned.  I'm having to reset it at least every other day.  I have a good signal (shows ""Excellent"" all the time) but i'm still having to reset.  In addition, if something in my house is using a lot of bandwidth, the web browsing speed slows to a crawl.Get something else.  This isn't worth the headaches.  What good is dual band Wireless N if you can't use it anyway."
651,this router came to me working poorly but I didn't save the box so I could not return it. I called AT&T and they told me I got one of the worst ones they have had experience with. I would skip this one.
652,"UPDATE: Everything I said before about this screen is true and I love it when it works. Problem is the monitor got a NASTY discolored pixel line down the side of it. What is wrong with these screens? This is the second screen that has had a pixel issue. Unfortunately I'm out of the country for a while (with the screen) and I have to live with this issue until I return. Thankfully it has a 3 year warranty so I'll be able to get it replaced but honestly after having two issues like this I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have never had this bad of luck with computer monitors and have only had one dead pixel in 9 monitors that I have owned in my lifetime. Save your money and buy something else._____________________________________________Alright so here's the deal. This monitor is PHENOMENAL. Its highly capable. The color accuracy is awesome. It's really bright which I love. The ergonomic stand is amazing. It has USB ports, a card reader, picture in picture, amazing menu, and it's 1920 x 1200. I've played games from my PS3 through HDMI and from the PC and no ghosting with DEUS EX: HUMAN REVOLUTION. The super high resolution and rich colors makes for a BEAUTIFUL gaming experience. So if you are a gamer who is on the fence about getting this, DON'T WORRY, IT'S ALL GOOD!Editing photos on this compared to my old monitor (a VIZIO TV) is as different as night and day. Photoshop is truly served justice on this monitor. Before I thought my photos needed to be saturated and made more vibrant. Nope, that was the crappy monitor. No wonder my photos looked waaaay overdone on other people's computers Lol.This comes with HDMI, VGA, and a DVI chord so don't freak out if you ordered this and then realize the day its coming that you have to rush out and buy an overpriced chord that you could have gotten on Company A for 10 cents. Nope its provided.The warranty on this thing is THREE years. That's hard to beat. And this isn't a warranty that you have to wrestle with ASUS about either. One pixel screws up, they replace your whole screen. Inside the box is a ""ASUS VIP MEMBER NOTICE."" Ya that's right, when you buy this, you are a VIP and they sure do treat you like it.Back to the ergonomic stand. My first ever LCD screen was a viewsonic about 11 years ago. It was REVOLUTIONARY. That thing turned into portrait mode and I LOVED it. Well every future monitor I've has since didn't think it was an important enough feature to include. WELL ASUS DOES. Portrait mode on this is a beast. It's 24 inches so basically any webbrowsing you do for now on requires no scrolling up and down. This screen fits the whole dang page into it. You'll learn very quickly that the only thing on the side of websites are pointless ADs you don't want to see anyway. But once you need to turn the screen back into landscape, its really simple and takes one second to turn.  This stand is ROCK SOLID. You can raise and lower this thing about 5 inches. So basically you can have the bottom of the screen resting on your desk or you can have it raised super high if your desk is too low. The screen swivels and pivots as well very nicely. It's just a very fluid stand. I never though a stand would impress me but wow this thing in itself is worth $100.Nobody has discussed the picture in picture in any review about this so I'll review it myself.  SO in your LCD Menu there is an option to turn on ""PIP."" With PIP you can flip through another input such as VGA and Display Port. UNFORTUNATLY you cannot have HDMI be in your PIP when your PC is hooked up via DVI . I don't know the electronic science behind this but it disappoints me. BUT you CAN have a VGA plugged into your PC (and if your video card is DVI then get a VGA to DVI adapter) and then you can play your PS3 or watch a DVD  and see what is going on with your PC or vice versa.  So that is pretty friggin sweet.There's really nothing I can bash this screen about. It looks great IMO, it performs great IMO, its covered by a great warranty IMO, and the size is purrrfect IMO.  My original review I gave it 3 stars because my first screen came with two dead pixels. But Company A turned Lemons into Lemonade. They shipped me a replacement OVERNIGHT at ZERO cost and I didn't have to send back the defected screen until I received the new one. ASUS would have taken care of me too and technically they did because I called them and they treated me like a VIP (as I said they do earlier) but informed me Company A would take care of it since I just got it. After 30 days if I had another issue they would take care of me.  I was never told ""Tough,"" ""That's gonna cost you...,"" ""It'll be _____ amount of weeks,"" by anyone.  So I STRONGLY recommend  getting this monitor because you really have nothing to lose."
653,This case is Not for the Canon Powershot Elf 310HS.Very disappointing that there is no Waterproof case for the 310HS
654,"From the beginning I ran into some issues with turning the device on and off. The remote wouldn't always work (it just would respond randomly). Sometimes the manual power switch would turn the receiver on and it would click back off in about 3 seconds. It would usually take about 3 times of pushing the power button to make the receiver stay on.Once it was working I was satisfied with the sound quality and menus, albeit the menus would not always show up when I feel like they should. e.g. Pushing the menu button on one input would bring up the sound menu and just not work on another input (all inputs were 1080p).The last straw was 5 days into ownership when the front left and center channel started hissing all the time when the receiver was powered on. Even after removing all inputs it would provide a constant and very audible hiss.I really wanted to like this receiver with the functionality it boasted and a friendly price tag ($250).Final note: I called Onkyo and after a 25 minute wait for a representative we did some basic troubleshooting for the hissing; we came to the conclusion that it needed warranty work. They were helpful and provided a local dealer (Bloomington, MN) that I contacted. They didn't seem helpful and gave me a 5 week window for the repair. Needless to say, I returned it to Company A (they were extremely helpful).If you choose to try this receiver, best of luck! I hope it works out for you."
655,"As I had confidently tossed the original paperwork, really liking this product in the beginning, the keyboard stopped charging after only two weeks. I noticed right from the beginning that the connection into the keyboard was loose. Now the light doesnt come on at all. I charged it maybe 4 times. So goodbye to $60! One other very annoying thing is that the lock button is right above the backspace button, and I kept accidently hitting the lock button and the screen would lock and turn black. And I have small fingers, so I can imagine that it would be difficult for someone with large hands. Really dissappointed as I was so excited about this purchase."
656,"I bought this accessory to go along with a Trio Stealth Pro 7&#34; tablet since it was recommended for that purpose on Company A's Trio page. Unfortunately, what was not clear was that the plug on the keyboard is a standard USB A female looking for a USB A male receptacle on the tablet, and the tablet has only a USB mini female receptacle. To further compound the error, it was also recommended that the keyboard be purchased with a micro OTG host cable instead of one with a mini plug. All around, very confusing.I wound up returning the keyboard because I couldn't test it."
657,"This looks fancy and like a nice hard cover especially for the price it is, but its nothing more than a cheap sticker!! Needless to say, I returned it right away"
658,"The remote hardware isn't bad. It might actually be kind of nice. But I wouldn't really know since I can't get the software that sets up the remote to be worth its weight in helium. On a Mac half of the input fields (even search in their help section) don't work, and it freezes constantly. And with all the configuration options it has it still can't get my TV to switch back and forth between 2 HDMI inputs. Seriously.So while the remote itself feels better than my Tivo remote and would be great if it could switch between Tivo and Apple TV with a single button...it's pretty useless if I have to keep the old TV remote around switch inputs for it.LAME, Logitech. Just lame."
659,"I like this remote a lot but one thing I can't stand is that it reset itself randomly when I set it down. Maybe I should be extra more delicate but it's random. The overall feel is great. I would recommend if you want something cheap and easy to use but if you have the cash, get the ONE.Pros:cheap, easy to set up, nice feel to it.Cons:battery operated(i knew this from the start), It is very delicate, resets if i placed it harder than usual on my tableedit: It's gotten worse with the restart. Will get warranty replacement on this remote. i wouldn't recommend at all!"
660,"What a horrible product!  I bought these aware of the possibility they would not perform as well as the name brands and more expensive units but I had no idea they would be so bad.1.  Pairing them with each other was pointless.  Once they were paired, I could hardly hear anything coming through.  Even at full volume, I had to go into a completely silent room and have my wife talk on the other end before I could even tell they had paired successfully.  I tried to pair them several more times with the same result.  Since rider to passenger communication was the primary reason I wanted them, they were effectively useless to me.2.  Pairing one with my phone worked to some degree.  The volume was much louder than with the other unit but probably still not loud enough to hear over the wind at 60 mph.  Also, the was a significant amount of static in the audio but it wasn't enough to make conversation impossible.3.  They would not play music from my phone.  The music could be heard but seemed to stutter and was something I couldn't bear to listen to at all.By far, this is one of the worst products I have ever purchased and it's definitely the worst product I've ever bought on Company A.  I only wish I could give it a zero star review.  Thanks to Company A, I was able to return them for a full refund.  I recommend buying a better unit for more money if you want something that actually works as advertised."

663,"While this is supposed to be a class 10 card, it's so slow in my digital camera that after taking a pic, it takes an extra sec or two before the camera is readied again.It's very surprising, because an older (class unknown) card that I bought 3 years ago didn't have the extra sec or two problem in the same digital camera.I didn't do a benchmark and see which SD card was faster, but my assumption of a brand new class 10 card was it ought to be faster than a 3-year old SD card as least in a digital camera.I returned it the same day it arrived."
664,"I had this drive for two weeks as my laptop's (Toshiba Satellite A665-S6100X) primary and only hard drive.  I upgraded to the new firmware (2.0.9) and everything.As soon as I started using this drive, my machine would freeze from anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes; only the mouse cursor would move, everything else was unresponsive, and the hard drive activity LED would be constantly lit.  This would occur upwards of 5 or more times a day, every day.At least once every day during normal work loads, my computer would BSOD. Upon reboot, the hard drive would be undetectable by the BIOS.  I would have to leave the computer off for 30+ seconds before it could see the drive.I contacted OCZ tech support, and the official support guy, some engineer, laughed at me publicly on their forum; he actually was insulting to me, complaining that I thought having to install Linux on a USB stick was a little too much to get a drive working correctly.I decided to trade in the drive for theKingston 240 GB HyperX Series SATA 3.0 Gb-s 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive, SH100S3/240Gand have had a wonderful experience ever since."
665,"We plugged it in, switched it on and... nothing. Blank screen. Fiddling with output is not possible, since on our Ipad2 you apparently cannot access these settings. It's supposed to automatically mirror the screen on the TV when you start playing a video, but it doesn't, at least not on our Samsung TV. The HDMI cable we use works fine with other machines.A quick check of the Apple forums reveals plenty of users with the same issue, and... zero successful fixes. We really tried, and then eventually gave up.There are better ways to waste two hours and $39.00."

667,"I have been trying for six months to burn Blu-ray DVDs with the most recent version of Toast.  My current burn has taken three days, I have had to start over 3 times because it stops encoding.  I am running the newest version of Toast on a brand new iMac, so there is no problem with lack of memory or processing speed.  The Toast program is just junk.UPDATE: I recently had to make CD copies of a private music performance.  Toast took 45 minutes PER CD.  I had to burn 100.  I switched to iTunes, which copied the same CDs in 5 minutes.  If possible, I'd like to give this program 1/2 star -- and that would be generous because I can't think of anything positive to say about it.UPDATE MARCH 2014: Roxio just updated the software.  Hard to believe, but it is now WORSE!  Creating video compilations does not work at all.  Roxio Media Player is gone.  I have had 12...  yes TWELVE... crashes of the program in the past 24 hours.Looking for another brand of software.

673,"Unlike most of the positive reviews, I have owned a few of these drives for around 2 years now. For most of them, they seemed fine during the first few months. So in my mind any review where the drive is less than 3+ months old is not really valid.I have not had any of the green drives I own survive more than about a year or a year and half at most. Out of the 7 I now own, I have replaced all of them once. And I think I have to replace a replacement now as well.If you're willing to risk the data you put on these drive getting corrupted, then you can save a few dollars but so far I have yet to have one of the green drives not die before the warranty expired.If you think ""hey it's under warranty, so no big deal"" then you're not thinking it all the way through.Having to replace a drive means losing files or data as well. It's not like replacing a video card or other component. You lose more than just time when a drive fails.And there was no advanced warning of a failure on any of the drives. I only found out that a drive was starting to fail when I started seeing problems with files getting corrupted and the OS telling me that I had to do a file system check on the drive.The replacement drives are not new drives. They are all re-certified drives. Which means they were all sent back as damaged and maybe WD fixed something before shipping it back out.I originally started out with 4 drives at once to put in to a RAID device. I thought that since it was raid 5, it wouldn't hurt if a drive died. Well what happened was 2 drives started corrupting data at about the same time. Which meant the problem was not recoverable. RAID 5 can survive a single drive failure at a time but not 2. To make the situation worse, the drives didn't start by dying completely. The 2 drives started out by corrupting data in small enough amounts that it was no immediately noticeable. So once I knew there was a real problem around 5-10% of the 3TB of data had scattered amounts of corrupt files. I was able to copy most of the files off the array. Unfortunately because of the corruption I had to trash about 50% of the files because parts of groups of files were corrupted which meant the whole group of files was useless. For example some of the music albums I purchases had a few songs that were bad. So it meant each of those albums was essentially ruined. Most of that was replaceable at least, but for a lot of things there was no other source for the files. And there wasn't a back up because it was a RAID5 array and was not supposed to need a backup because what are the odds of having 2 drives fail at the same time?Since then I've been running the drives in mirrored pairs and even that has really helped at least when they are relying on win7 drive mirroring. windows doesn't seem keep track of which drive is primary and which is the copy or something so if either drive starts to corrupt data, windows spends days ""re-synching"" the drives and the net result is that some files end up being corrupted."
674,"After failing with a passive adapter, I bought this after seeing the nice reviews. Plugged it in and GREAT - got to use my larger monitor again.Until reboot.

675,"I don't know how this keyboard, or any keyboard, could get more than 1 star when it's missing the right-hand shift key.  For most people (and most are touch-typists) we use the right-shift about half the time.  How could you get capital letters on the left side of the keyboard when the only shift key is on the left side?  I tried it, and found I can't type intelligent (ie. correct punctuation and capital letters) email or letters without two shift keys.  I've decided the only good case is the Zagg"
676,"This is absolutely the worst router ever.  In fact, I think all Cisco/Linksys routers are.  I bought this one to replace an older Cisco/Linksys because the older one was constantly going out.  Many times a day it would just drop the internet connection.  It was AWFUL.  I read all the reviews here and many people said they had experienced the exact same thing.  But I was in a store last week and decided to pick one up there because I couldn't take the old one a day longer.  Unfortunately, this was the only brand the store had.  So I decided to give it a chance.  It was just so hard to believe that a router from such a huge router company wouldn't work.I got it home, hooked it up and for an entire week it worked perfectly!  I was so happy.  I thought I had finally gotten over my router troubles.  Then suddenly tonight - IT WENT OUT!  Just like the old one did.  Just like the reviewers here said it did for them (click and read all the 1 star reviews).  It worked for a week.  Now it's totally worthless.  Yep, I can take it back to the store but I have to find the receipt - which is somewhere around here, but only God knows where!  And the hassle of taking it back... it's really not worth it.  I don't know if other routers are any better, but my advice to any buyers here is BUY ANOTHER BRAND!  Any brand!  Just don't buy this one!  It's AWFUL."
677,"I got a new iPad 2 a couple of weeks ago and bought a weeks ago and bought aDeft Detour 360: Rotating iPad 2 Case (Folio Convertable Case Multi-angle Vertical and Horizontal Stand with Smart On/Off for the Apple iPad2)for my iPad and have been very happy with it. Yesterday, we got my wife and iPad 2 and since they had this case at the store we went ahead and purchased it so she would have a case from the beginning. Needless to say, the case went back to the store today.Major Problems:1. Feels flimsy, thin, and cheap - that is because it is2. Ill fitting - have to push it in very tight to get the cutouts to line up and then they don't line up all that well3. Cutout for power cord makes it super hard to remove connector (i.e. opening is too small)4. Doesn't protect much with its super thin materialI would definitely not buy this again. I'm off to buy anotherDeft Detour 360: Rotating iPad 2 Case (Folio Convertable Case Multi-angle Vertical and Horizontal Stand with Smart On/Off for the Apple iPad2)Very simply, this particular Belkin case should be price about $12.95 to $14.95 as that is what grade case it is. Compared to other cases in this price range, the Belkin is garbage. I expect to see these cases on close out racks in a few months.Nothing personal Belkin. I would still try other products by you, but this is one is a total miss especially at this price point."

679,"I was looking forward to using this router when it arrived, however its performance is abysmal.  I own an older buffalo model and it was time to replace it (I had to reboot it every week or so), but I had no major usability issues with the older model.  I plugged in the new router, got it up and working (which was a drop difficult but not a showstopper), and I noticed that my connection would intermittently drop.  I ran a few extended pings and I found that I couldn't send 30 straight pings without dropping at least three.  I also noticed that my desktop would complain of limited connectivity every so often, even when I wasnt running my ping tests (so I wasnt hitting any kind of rate limiter or IPS).  I connected my old buffalo router just for comparison and I didnt drop a single ping for over two minutes.This one's going straight back to Company A.  Very poor product, buffalo..."

Went through the tech support song and dance and they said it was a faulty receiver to request a new one.  Company A shipped new and same thing.  Now tech support says it's the wi-fi card even though my network sees the unit and even the Android app sees it and I have a 55-68% signal strength.  Got the new card in and a little better but less than 10% chance of a connect and then it is lost. Sometimes will get the menu for the station but will not connect to a stream. The unit is only about 25 feet from my wireless router and the signal strength app on my tablet shows a strong consistent signal.  I can even go 25 feet further and OUTSIDE on my deck and instantly connect and listen to Pandora on my tablet.  Yet they say I have 3 options, send the unit to the service center for service, HA which one the first or the second I still have both brand new units here as this has only been a week.  Purchase a wi-fi signal booster, I guess you need a turbo charged signal to get it to work, or return for a refund.

684,I'm pretty sure I can get this to fit into the computer but a little instruction sheet would have been nice. An update. You would have to be technically proficient in order to be able to properly disassemble a laptops body to get to the power port. The part looks plug and play but only if you know how to play.

687,"I bought 2 packages of this item, i.e. 4 pink cables. My husband and I travel, quite a bit. I needed additional spare USB sync cables for travel. I was really thrilled, since this would make it easier to find the cables in my purse or my laptop case.Just FYI, these cables are an awesome bright pink color. Definitely easy to find when your purse lining is black. :)After noticing that I was unable to charge my iPhone with one of these cables, I tested all 4 cables with 3 chargers and my laptop. One of these chargers is a car charger; another charger is an original iPad charger. The 3 chargers and my laptop charge my iPhone 3GS and iPad, 1st generation, with no problem. I compared the 4 pink cables to 2 old USB sync cables that I keep at home. These are my findings:1. None of the 4 cables charge my iPhone 3GS.2. The 4 cables unreliably charged my iPad.3. The plastic cover over the USB end was not glued well. The plastic cover kept slipping, making it very difficult to remove the cable from the USB port.Throughout the testing, my 2 old cables had no problems charging my iPhone/iPad with the 3 chargers & laptop.I don't know about anyone else, but the last thing anyone should ever have to do is test all new USB sync cables with all of one's iPhone/iPad chargers. :( I'm returning all four cables. If I could have given a Zero-Star Rating, I would have."
688,If you saw my review on the logitech keyboard and case for ipad you would have seen that I mentioned an $80 keyboard and case. Well this is the keyboard and case I bought for $80.  I see that it is much lower here and in my opinion it is not even worth the lower price. The keyboard is nice and only thing I used from this as the case had some major design issues. It also didn't turn the ipad on and off. Any way like I said all I used until I got the logitech one was the keyboard. However one thing I did mention was the fact that keyboard needed charged almost every night. I don't think the battery was any good in it.I am so upset that I am unable to return this one but that is not Company A's fault as I didn't get it from Company A.
689,"Flimsy and cheap. Spend the extra $10 and get the Incipio NGP or, if you need Smart Cover compatibility, the Belkin version. If you don't use the Smart Cover, I can't stress enough how much better the NGP is - best minimal iPad case on the market."
690,"Update Summary:  Originial SSD died after 6 months, RMA was done and now the replacement SSD is dead after 8 months of use.  Waiting on 3rd SSD.My OCZ Agility 3 120GB SSD died 6 months after turning it on for the first time. Turned on my newly built system July 4, 2012, SSD died January 19, 2013.  This was my boot drive.  OCZ sent me an RMA number within 1 day of contacting them about my issue, which either says their customer service is amazing or this is a reoccuring issue they have.  Either way, I am really dissappointed with OCZ at the momment.  I was editing some video footage and the system froze up completely, then BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) with no warning.  After the restart, the computer indicated it needed a boot drive and to restart the system again.  My Asus P8Z77-V Motherboard turned on it's red boot LED warning light and the bios doesn't even see the OCZ Agility 3 drive any longer in the boot directory, but still sees other drives connected to the system.  I tried different Sata ports, Sata cables, Power Cable and a whole different computer all with no luck.  The drive isn't seen on any system now, internally or externally.  The status lights on the SSD was green and red initially after the BSOD restart, but now it is just green which is normal I believe, but the drive is still dead and not working or seen. I haven't even sent the OCZ drive back yet as I just got the RMA# yesterday, but I have however already purchased another SSD from a different brand (A Samsung 840 Pro 256GB now).  OCZ will replace this SSD under warranty according to the RMA status for my account although I haven't returned it yet.  That is the status shown for my RMA# claim, but I refuse to have another OCZ as my boot/primary drive again not to say another drive can't fail, but 6 months is very quick in my opinion for any drive.  To be fair, maybe I just got a lemon OCZ drive.  I'll use the replacement OCZ Agility 3 120GB as a workflow drive with photos, movies, etc while I am working with the footage and not really as a storage drive as I don't trust the drive.  All trust has been lost.  It was a great drive during it's short lived life honestly and that is why I still give this drive 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 stars, but I have to factor in the recent data lost (not backed up yet), inconvience and extra money on a new drive that this OCZ Agility 3 has cost me.  If the OCZ drive survives, it is a great drive.  Very fast boot up times and overall performance, but none of that means anything if it is dead and doesn't work.Now the replacement OCZ SSD is dead as well after 8 months of use.  This device is a piece of JUNK...  DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
691,This product is fraustrating to use because it's difficult to re-connect once you are disconnected from the unit. Takes while for it to connect and access data. The most crappiest thing is that power down using power button doesn't work unless you hold it down for more than 40 seconds and the HARD DRIVE FAILS TO WORK within the first month of the purchase!!! IT'S AN ABSOLUTE JUNK JUNK JUNK !!! DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPIEST OF ALL CRAP!!!
692,"I bought a pair of SL 150 for $70 and a pair of SL100 for about $55 from Staples as they discontinued to carry this brand last month.  The SL 150 earpieces are too small that they sit on your ears. The thing clamps on your head so tight.  Even after I tried so many different tricks to expand it to ease the pressure on my ears it still hurts.  The sound quality is ok but not exceptional.  The problem is that it hurts so much that I can't even wear them for 5 minutes.  I offered them to my teenage sons who have smaller heads than me, but they declined because these headsets hurt them so much that they can't bear the pain and redness on their ears, no matter how you adjust them.  I can't return them and they are sitting on the bookshelf."
693,"Pretty to look at when its off that is. Unfortunately when it on and the lights go down you can see how ugly this monitor can get. I game in a man cave and the first thing I noticed when I started using this monitor was the left side was about 1/4"" lower than the right side. I verified this with a level and propped up the right side with game cases until it was level. The second thing I noticed was was in the lower right hand side of the monitor was a screen wrinkle and back-light bleed. At that point I was very disappointed in my purchase. After 12 hours of game playing at 120hz goodness. I decided I just couldn't look past some major flaws so I packed it up and sent it back.The 120hz made for a very nice and fluid gaming experience. However the cost vs value just isn't there. If this monitor were $250 to $350 then I might be willing to forgive some flaws but at $700 it just isn't worth it.Update 1/19/2012:I thought I would give this monitor another try because I really liked gaming at 120hz. The 2nd monitor I got was level this time but the backlight bleed was much worse. This time I not only have it in the bottom right hand corner. I also have it on the entire left side. This is completely unacceptable for a monitor that is this price. You are better off trying to catch a Midnight U2711 on sale for $775 to $850 than spend $699 on this monitor. I am anxious for 120hz technology but am not willing to forgive the build quality of the 2 that I have tried. I have changed my original rating of 2 stars to 1."
694,"I have had it for a couple of months.  It worked well for a while with the iMac.  Then I had to go into the configuration page (192.168.1.1) to make an adjustment, but then there was repeated  failure to connect to 192.168.1.1 although it recognized the WAN connection.  On reboot, same thing.  Then I could not access 192.168.1.1 even on hard reset.  I unsuccessfully tried to access the configuration page after pressing the reset button many times with no change.  Finally, I tried to reconfigure it after a hard reset on another computer, a PC.  The configuration page came up at first, I reset the router from the configuration page, tried to set it up, again it could not connect with the internet even though it saw the WAN.  Then 192.168.1.1 did not come up at all.Now all it does is pass through the connection directly through my ISP and does not connect through the router interphase.  I cannot reach the configuration page at all so the router is unsecured.  You can't set up a VPN if you can't access 192.168.1.1.I wanted something more sophisticated then my Netgear router but this is not it.  Spent much too much time on it trying to make it work.Apparently, the warranty is send it back to the factory.  I have disconnected both the modem and the router and will let it sit for a while and see if it will respond after that.  No great hopes tho.I would not recommend this pain of a router."
695,"Right after I bought this item, the price dropped by over half. I thought about giving the Beacon for iOS 2 stars instead of 1, but that sudden price drop seriously frosts me. Pluses: Works well with Bluetooth on iDevices, comes right up, reasonably easy to navigate, at least at first. I was able to match the Beacon with all three devices involved, including my Toshiba flat-screen, Sony BluRay and Roku 2XS. Allows use of the iPhone/iPad keyboard, which is a potentially huge advantage. BUT...Minuses: Non-standard interface. Does not have an AC plugin. Claims compatibility with over 200,000 devices, but attempts to shoehorn a visually unattractive, very bare-bones controller interface over all devices of each type (LCD TV, DVD/BluRay, etc...). Unfortunately, you wind up missing a LOT of important buttons on all devices, such as the Input button on the TV remote. Oops. that one is kinda important. You will still wind up reaching for the device remotes because there's just too much missing for controlling all modern devices. The Dijit software app also looks like crap - there is no other way to put it. It is not up to basic iOS software design standards and is clearly not fully integrated with the Beacon. If it is, that's even worse. Switching between devices is agony - once you've set them up, you have to ascend and descend through the menus every time.This is a classic case of software and hardware technology showing great promise only to fail miserably in practice. The Dijit software is terrible and cripples this thing. Unfortunately, the Beacon is going to have the batteries yanked and go right into the junk gadget drawer. At least I don't have to worry about a wall wart! Maybe someone will someday write an app for this thing that actually works."
696,"The product was bought 2 years ago and has crashed.The receiver had a great sound and I was happy with it.I was so happy I bought the same receiver for my music room.I am now worried that the new receiver will crash just after 2 years.When I bought this  TX-NR809,I felt I was buying a quality receiver that was going to last for years so a paid the price for a quality receiver.I had a Kenwood 5.1 that lasted 25 years with no problems.When I went on the websites I saw many people that had the 809 audio crash.Onkyo has a 2 year warranty and my receiver ran 1 month over.Plus you have to pay for shipping both ways.To say I am disappointed would not do it justice.Onkyo has a defect and is not taking responsibility for it.I think they created a expensive disposable receiver instead or the quality that they were known for."
697,"After reading reviews of this product and seeing the common problem of failing clips, I remembered seeing this on eBay:[...]It's a genuine Blackrapid locking carabiner. You can buy them for about $12 each. Even if you buy two and replace the cheap versions on the Rainbowimaging strap, you're still under half the price of a Blackrapid double.You can also buy Blackrapid replacement attachment screws."
698,"This is the worst fitting sleeve I have ever seen. It says designed specifically for the Company F M14x. I do not see how this is possible. I felt like I was forcing my laptop into this tiny case. The corners were poking out and stretching the case. This looked like it was doing more harm then good.Please see the pictures.I returned this sleeve and bought the Incase 15"" Neoprene Sleeve Case.The Laptop FITS AMAZINGLY!"

However, charging is slow, hence takes longer to get both phones working. Usually land up charging one at a time"
700,"I'm not sure if this was or was not a genuine Apple battery for my Macbook, but it died in 2 months with moderate use, with less than 100 charge cycles on it.  It worked great brand new for those 2 months of ownership, keeping a capacity of 95% or greater after each charge (properly calibrated), accordingly to both the Apple system profiler and Coconut Battery app.  But after a final charge one day, the Macbook just shutdown after the power adapter was removed following a fully charged cycle.  The computer would never run on that battery alone again.  The computer did not detect it as a faulty battery so I am not sure what was going on with it.  Luckily, Company A offered me a return on it despite being purchased over 30 days and I just received my refund (although a partial credit - ~$16 less than originally purchased price).Like everyone says, it is better to pay more and go with what you know to be the real thing directly from Apple.  Not sure what is going to with these discounted Apple-branded batteries, but this is my 2nd (and final) experience with a supposed genuine Apple battery dying with less than 100 cycles.  Heed my advice!I am using my original battery from 2008 that has almost 1200 cycles on it and it is still maintaining a capacity of better than 60%.  I'll probably sell the Macbook before ever buying a new battery for it, but I hear the NuTech batteries from OWC are an excellent replacement."
701,"Bought this drive new and installed Windows 7 Home Premium for my HTPC.  This drive was quiet and worked great for 5 days then went dead during a program installation. Tried rebooting several times with 'no hard drive found' error message.  Took it out and tried booting on a usb/SATA adapter, but same result.Bummer is that I've now tried for one month to get Corsair on the line for an RMA, but no luck.  Should have bought this at Company A, but bought it at Fry's. One star is all this company and drive deserve. NOTICE: If your SSD goes south- good luck on getting any response out of Corsair.  From the time I put in my RMA request to when I had to input a second RMA request, their system had already logged over 20,000 RMA requests in just 10 days!!!"
702,"I was hoping to be able to use ths mount so I could move my GPS unit from one car to another without having to remove then re-apply my existing suction cup mount every time; however, the round disk in the middle of this beanbag-like mount to which one is supposed to mount the GPS unit won't hold suction for more than a minute or two using my current GPS suction cup mount, which works just fine on a windshield.  I'm considering glueing my suction cup mount to this one, but I think, like a beanbag, I'll just toss it."
703,"Does nothing more than just making noise. Arrived wrapped in styrofoam sheeting inside a bubble-wrap envelope, no inside packaging, no instructions, no brand name or markings at all, except for a part number on the &#34;hose&#34; inlet. Plugged into a USB charger, and it &#34;worked&#34; (motor turned and a light came on) but accomplished nothing.At less than $3 it's a small loss and at best, an amusing novelty. Don't waste your time or money"
704,"First, let me say that Company A did their best to take care of me. When the 1st Magellan 9055 LM would not work, Company A replaced it almost immediately. When the Bluetooth Function on the 2nd Magellan did not work, I contacted Magellan directly and ask for help.  Their service department responded that the Bluetooth function on the Magellan 9055 LM would not work with my Motorola Phone.  Not only would it not work with my Motorola Phone; it would not work with my spouse's phone or my neighbor's phone or any one else who had a Bluetooth enabled phone that I tried. Their customer service department said it was not compatible with these phones either.  I ask for a list of phones it would work with and could not get an answer, even after more than one try.  I contacted them again and ask how a person was supposed to know if a certain phone would work with their Bluetooth equipped GPS unit. Would a person just have to pay the extra money for this option and take your chances.  Again, no answer.  I contacted Magellan again and said that at first, I did not believe the poor reviews Magellan has received on customer service; but that I do believe it now.  Still no response on this from Magellan.About the Magellan 9055 LM: I had to receive (2)of the 9055 LM GPS to get one that would work on everything except the Bluetooth.  I cannot understand a major company like Magellan having such poor customer service.  The upper management of Magellan needs to examine their policies because they are losing customers because of such poor customer service.  Something else I do not understand.  Why would a company like Magellan make a Bluetooth equipped GPS unit that is not compatible with so many Bluetooth equipped phones.  I have 4 other Bluetooth equipped GPS units that are not Magellan and my and my spouse's phone will work with all of them with the exception of the Magellan 9055 LM.  In all fairness, I must say the GPS functions of the 2nd Magellan 9055 LM that I received works very well.  Only the Bluetooth function, which I need very much, does not work.Also, please be assured that Company A responded very timely and with the utmost courtesy in replacing the 1st unit.  I did not send the 2nd unit back because I desperately needed it to go into a vehicle used for research purposes.  Thank you Company A.I was hoping Magellan would offer a solution to the problem of the Bluetooth not working, or at least furnish a list of what phones it would work with.  They have failed to do anything to address these issues and for this reason I would not purchase their products at all. If Magellan ever sees fit to address this issue, I would be pleased to write another review; but I am sure this will not take place because it seems they do not care about their products reputation or their customers satisfaction."
705,"If you don't mind replacing your Bluetooth headset, every six months, then you will be very happy.  Its sound quality and comfort are excellent.  But it is fragile.  Regardless of how careful you are, it will fall apart within a few months.Others who rate this headset with five stars haven't owned it as long as I have."
706,"I have owned this for a year now.  The picture is nice but I get random wash-outs every few seconds.  Not sure how to explain it, image briefly flashes bright.  It records these events also. I thought it was a defect and Trendnet sent me a new camera.  Still does it.  The software is confusing and not user friendly.  I like the software for their older cameras better.  The motion detection does not work at all.  It's terrible.  Half the time it detects motion when there is none and then doesn't detect motion when a car drives by.  Sensitivity adjustments doesn't make a bit of difference as if it doesn't work at all.  My older trendnet cameras detect motion very well.  I am practically recording non stop and my 250gb hard drive fills up in no time at all.  High maintenance having to always delete files to make space.  I wish this software had the option to record still images upon motion detection and if it does I haven't figured it out yet.  Once again, older software had this option and it was very easy to setup.  I wish this camera would work with the old software.  It detects the camera but won't connect.  I would not buy this product."

708,"I buy the Halo screen protectors for my iPhone 4 and love them, but these are garbage. First of all they are marked 4 to a package and there were only three. Secondly, they don't work - at all! The die cuts barely line up with the home button and the iSight camera, and the sticky side meant to stick to the screen isn't sticky. In the least! I tried all three that came in the package, and all three were garbage. Choose another brand of screen protector for your iPad."
709,This is the worst item I've ever purchased from Company A.  I threw it away.  Loading it was difficult and playback was even more confusing.  This was an insult to the environment.
710,"Why I should have given the money to Church instead:- Average sound quality and lesser base(non too essential unless that's what you care)- Not made to last and so is the leather muffle.- Wire connection for to headphone and device will losen overtime so does the quality of sound taken factor.- Short battery life(not an issue if you use rechargable. Recommand Rayvac from Target great battery and cheap)- No improvement since QC2- Hit and run customer service. Only option for customer is pay 100-150 USD to replace a new. Yes you do have to quite stright and rude. Screaming their ears off and no compomise. (had to replace my QC2 quit for no reason)- Over rated price which took totally different ideal from their original founder. Initial founder believe in fair price and quality sound for all.- One good of all sad faces. Light I often forget I had them on. Where is my glasses? (oh it's on my head)- I will give it as a good ear warmer during winter time too.I am not a professional sound track personal. However I will not dull myself due to paying expensive price then believe I own the best. I firmly believe even Royce has it's down falls.Some say Stax are fine set. I did not earn it yet so that's up to you to find out.Choices are naturally up to you. But I hope I could at least shead some pre buy knowledge to you. I personally dont want to give company such as Bose a chance to survive. Take a good thought why do you love Company A. Whereas Bose has become rodent of society.From customer that demands uncompromised quality,Work hard and be willing to pay/support to whom deserves,Ted"

712,"My inlaws bought this adsl modem + router + wifi access point as a replacement for another one that stopped working after a few years of service.  They had no problem setting it up, which justifies the one star.Unfortunately, the wireless is very bad.  I get signal in far reaches of the house, but pages don't load and pings time out unless I'm right on top of it.  The real deal-breaker is that it seems like you can't get more than one device online at a time through the wireless (wired is fine).  When the family all comes to the parents' house, we have 3 smartphones and 3 computers, and the wifi dies.  We have to coordinate who goes online or the wifi dies and it won't work for anyone.We called the support line (USA number) and they said no agents were available and hung up (tried twice).The firmware download on the website seems to have a lower build number than the one that is already on the device, so I'm not sure if I should downgrade/upgrade.We're going out to buy another one from another company tomorrow to replace this."
713,"Seriously, folks, they just closed out the item at the manufacturer and sold their stock for ~$150!  Why are you paying ~$130 more than that for the thing?I have played with this item and for the money/a little more, I can name at least 2 other tablets that are just as good/better.  How about either offering from ASUS (Transformer is a great box!  Lots of options on it) or Acer's iconia?  Samsung Galaxy is good and the older one is now for sale less than what they are asking for this thing.And the other offerings don't come with the problem of no longer being manufactured/supported.$99 for the 16G and $149 for the 32G were fair prices.  This is just gouging at this point!Good luck if you are paying it, but I say anything over the manufacturer's sale price is a rip off!"
714,"Received mine dead on arrival, never worked with my Gen 1 iPad. For $5 it was worth the shot, but just spend the $5 on the Apple branded reader and save yourself the trouble."

717,"Audio signal sent by this unit is weak; it sounds thin, dim, and I would describe it as un-listenable.  My part may actually be defective.  Power-off issues aside, I can't even get it to sound like a normal audio signal.For $30, this is right on the threshold of 'worth my time to return' or not.  Leaning towards 'not' since I don't even want another one of these.  I value buying a quality product that I don't need to return, rather than junk from a company that replaces the first junk with more junk when the first junk breaks.I have a BluBridge and that works excellent, just gonna stick with that."
718,"The camera is very good but the EasyShare software is domineering, uncooperative with Mac and the EasyShare wireless app sets itself in the user account to open in the background at login.

719,"I'm afraid I can't recommend this product. It wouldn't seat properly in any PCI-E slot on my computer. I might have been able to force it in by tapping it with a hammer, but short of that, it wasn't going in. I compared the card to other PCI-E cards that I have, and it looks like the gap between the blank tab on the rear of the card and the tabs with the contacts is too small--certainly smaller than my other cards.

721,"In the specs it claims to move 70 CFM of air. There is no way it moves that much air. I know what 70CFM feels like and this fan's output is half of that at best. So what if it has a 160mm fan. If it doesn't move the claimed air then the fan size is immaterial. The ONLY reason it is silent is because it is barely rotating/spinning.Plus this thing doesn't cool my laptop effectively. At the very best it reduces the temp by 1 degrees C. This thing is just another piece of computer junk. I don't care for companies who make false claims to boost sales. I have bought other Cooler Master fans, case fans to be exact and they do the job. I trusted Cooler Master but no more. They have really taken a steep downturn with this product.I feel the 70CFM specs are falsified because if it moved that much air it would actually cool my laptop and it doesn't deliver the goods.I can cool my laptop offer better by holding it near a room stand fan. This cooling pad is a total ripoff. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
722,"This was working fine then one morning, all of a sudden, it was flashing the video screen on and off. The warranty on this is just 90 days. After that you're out of luck (me). Roku started out as a great company making quality streaming boxes. Seems lately they've turned into a more slimy creator of junk hardware that lasts just long enough until they come out with a new box."
723,The day I bought it the Roku 3 came out. I bought a Visio Video Stream player instead. The 2 was ok but it irritated me.
724,"I've had 2 of these die on me just when the warranty period ended. For the 10 hours they worked I loved them, but they aren't worth the money. Now if I wanna watch netflix or Company A on my TV I'll just plug my computer in, way cheaper and much more stable."

726,"I bought this Nuvi 2475 with North America and Europe maps for a trip to Italy. When I tried to download the maps into the unit the download failed time and time again. Garmin Tech Support worked with me for over an hour and the download was slow but seemed to be working so we stopped the trouble call. After another hour or so the download failed again. I called tech support again and learned that the unit was designed for smaller maps than they have today even though my unit was manufactured recently. Furthermore, none of the NA and Europe units manufactured today can hold all of the maps they are supposed to hold. The problem is that Garmin knew this and shipped the unit anyway.The solution then was to return the unit or plug in a 2GB SD card, which they provide, to give it more storage. I opted for the SD card. The SD card arrived a week later and it still didn't work. Garmin said that even the 2 GB SD card was not enough storage but they didn't have one to send me. I bought a 4 GB card and the maps finally loaded.I found this unit impossible to create locations for Italy, working from the US, in advance of the trip. Maybe that's me but I couldn't figure it out.In Tuscany, Italy, the maps were very inaccurate. The GPS helped somewhat but generally it was a joke. I wouldn't order one of these units ever again. Is it possible to give this no stars?"
727,It worked great for 2 days then quit. I am going to return it. There has to be a better converter than this. Lots of different brands but they all look the same?
728,"We have the last dim Kindle, and paid $100 for it. This is a $2 part at best, but wasn't included. This is why I have an ipad and refuse to buy any more of the Company A tablets. Power is not an optional accessory for a rechargeable device. Dumb decision Company A"
729,"Logitech needs to reconsider it's wireless unifying platform. I have tried a number of the mice (M705, Anywhere and MX Performance) and now the touchpad. The responsiveness of the Anywhere  mouse is the best, M705 is Ok. The MX kept losing connections, so I replaced it, but still having problems. The touchpad seems to be going the same way - loss of connectivity is a major problem - it's frequent, and long-lasting. I recommend getting a wired solution or the anywhere mouse."
730,"I've now tried three hard drives with this case. All three work with a SATA to USB adapter that I have. All three fail when installed in this case. Disappointing, to say the least."
731,"I have an iphone in an otterbox defender case that goes with me on all my bicycle rides.I use an app that tells me my speed, distance ect. I have another holder that works well, but it only holds the phone and it's a hassle taking it out of the case every time I go for a ride. The X part of this seems to hold the phone with the case very well and seems ideal for what I want. But it's almost impossible to put together. There is a double ball piece that goes between two other pieces and there are no instructions telling how to get the ball into the socket. We beat it with a hammer and got half of the job done but trying to do the other end-the part with the X, it felt like it was going to break the prongs. This would be great if it came pre assembled, or if it was easier to put together."
732,"I bought this device because I'm full time in a motorhome and often in a park with WiFi but a very weak signal which my Mac mini couldn't always lock onto. The description says ""...if you are trying to pick up Wi-Fi from long distances then this is the device to get! The AWUS036NH Receiver sensitivity will allow you to connect from greater distances and get stronger signals to Wi-Fi networks around you."" It turns out that it works this way only on a Windows system, but that limitation is not mentioned in the description. You can use it on a Mac to create a LAN, but not to connect a Mac to an existing WiFi network. I exchanged several emails with ALFA before I found this out. It was difficult communicating because they write in broken English that is often impossible to understand, and they obviously hadn't really read what I had written. They would make no offer to exchange it for a device that would work as described on a Mac. $30 down the drain. I don't know if Company A will refund my money because it's been a year since I bought it, and this week was the first time I actually needed it. Alfa denies any responsibility."
733,"Used this for 1 year and it died.  When it worked, it worked great.  The point of having SSD is fast and much more reliable than Spinning Disk.  This was not the case."
734,I was looking high and low for the right neck strap that is under $50. I ordered this because I liked the idea of a neoprene strap.  The straps on the side do not stay secure.  I put it on my camera and it slid right off. No way I am keeping that on my dslr!!  Returned it.
735,this is my second one and it went sour a month after use.  so far most of my linksys products have gone out on me after a few months of use.  i switched over to the new asus ac68 router and it made this obsolete.  my signal os stronger and more reliable now.
736,"bought used/refurbished from Company A warehouse, Item only booted to white screen. LG technical support led me through troubleshooting and determined that it broken/doa.Ended up going for a AOC monitor which has served me well so far."
737,"The unit arrived and the ""k"" key was broken. I tried to contact the company THREE times for a replacement and never heard back from them. There's no phone number to call for customer service, so I only had their email submission process to use to no avail.I am now stuck with a $40 piece of junk that doesn't work. If they had simply responded to my request and attempted some resolution, I wouldn't be so disappointed. There should be a zero stars rating for situations like this."
738,Got this for my uncles iPhone 4 and it didn't work at all unless the connector was pushed upwards pretty hard
739,"I purchased this cover for my macbook pro and within a 2 weeks of using it, the little rubber grippies on the bottom of the cover already fell off. My laptop only sits on a table, I never take it to class or anything so I don't know why the rubber grips would come off. There's still one intact, but even with it, my laptop is sliding all over the place. Would've been a nice case if the bottom grips were glued in with super weak glue. Want my money back or a replacement bottom case!!!!!!! Rip off, can't even use it because I'm afraid my laptops gonna fall of the table."
740,I ordered this the key will not activate. Norton indicates it's stolen until activated by the merchant...ie....PAID FOR! I had to push hard to return the software. Unfortunately I waited until the day my NIS 2012 expired to reload a new key and now I'm without virus software until I can reorder or go out an buy it retail.Update: I ordered NIS 2013 and used the key to reactivate my 2012 NIS direct from Company A...works perfectly
741,i damaged my existing H800.  so ordered these.  no USB plug in the package.  just the headset and the USB charging cord.  tried to synch it with my existing USB plug but will not synch.  so will return.I very much like these headphones when they work and would give them four stars for their actual quality.
742,"very disappointed with this, flimsy and the camera slot in the back is not lined up properly also dont like that i cant charge it while case is closed"
743,"Beware...I will not buy WD ever again after losing years of data.  I purchased this back up for the purpose of long term storage for a project at work and it locked up and we lost all.  I have data sets but the raw data is lost.  BEWARE.  They have a statement in the manual that they are not responsible for lost info due to malfunction.  Then they wanted to charge us money to ""try"" to recover it.  The heck with that.  I will go with a different brand from now on."
744,"The old saying you get what you pay for. This isn't any kind of leather let along Napa. I say invest a little more money and get some quaility. If leather isn't a issue with you then go for it, I personally wanted leather that's why I bought it. It's on it's way back to Company A!"
745,"Bought two of these on sale and returned them within the hour. Picture quality was better than others have related, but page load was terrible -- which really never completed after several attempts - even in a hotspot with a super-strong signal. Don't waste your money!"
746,"I bought two pairs of these headphones, and was pretty excited about them. Neither one of them worked. Neither indicated they were charging when plugged in, however I charged them for the recommended 3 hours. After the three hours, I tried the first pair, and nothing. It didn't light up, it was never visible to any other device (I used 3 different laptops and two different phones), and it just never did anything.The second pair never indicated it was charging as well but when pressed (and you have to really press it for something to happen) it eventually had a blue light began flashing. Then my phone indicated the signal. I connected it and I started hearing sound but only out of the left side.You would think one could have potentially been bad but both? One is an anomaly, but if both are bad, than there's probably a problem with how they are made.***Update***Company A replaced the two pairs I ordered with two more pairs. They arrived today. I put them on the charger, no indication that they were charging but gave them the recommended 3 hours anyway. After the three hours, I tried everything the instructions said and again, both pairs do not work. That's 0 for 4. They do not show they are charging, do not show any sign of life in any way. I tried the cables with another device, and the cables worked so it is the headsets. I really wanted to like these. How annoying."
747,"This article wasn't in the box,  i bought a coolermaster cooling pad and the memory but un the box only came the cooling pad, ver y desapointed"
748,"Unfortunately a large fraction of these lenses have a defect in which a double image appears at the 42mm end when shot with shutter speeds near 1/100th.  This problem occurs with or without OIS turned on.  This is not a problem of users not knowing how to use the lens.  It has been tested and verified by the site DPReview (which is actually owned by Company A).  They review this lens and demonstrate the double image problem in their review of the Panasonic GX1 on page 16 (Company A will not allow links, sorry).While DPReview has tested and clearly demonstrated this problem on more than one copy of the lens, and many users report the same problem, there are a few people that appear to have unaffected lenses.  So it is certainly possible to get a good lens, and optically it appears excellent.  If not suffering from the double image issue it probably is a four or even five star product.Until Panasonic sorts this out probably best not to purchase the lens.  Or, if you want to give it a try, purchase, test thoroughly and then return defective product to Company A.  You don't want to deal with Panasonic service - they stink - just return it to Company A as defective."
749,This is pure garbage. The tripod is all but useless. It is difficult to balance and it is extremely fragile. It is overpriced at free.
750,How do I know it is used? I shoot Canon & Fujifilm & had to recover photos on card. Tons of NEF Nikon images recovered! Am contacting Company A for explanation & replacement! BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE Company A!!!!!
751,"It works fine, except for the fact that it fits so loose in the optical outlet it has trouble staying in. My outlets on my tv face down and when I finally got it to stay in I just gentle backed away. Just to confirm that it's not my error, it barely fits into my av receiver. The fact that I ran the wire through the wall and now it barely stay in makes me say choose a different cable. I've have many different cables and they all fit tight except for this one. The slightest movement and it falls out. Pick another brand."
752,"DO NOT BUY..Nice unit if you want to play local network DNLA stuff, or watch from USB HD, but for anything online it is useless.It hijacks the network connection; For absolutely no reasonable excuse this unit has to connect to the SONY 'entertainment' network/servers and then it 're-streams' ALL internet entertainment ( Netflix/Hulu/YouTube/Pandora, etc.)  Any other unit just directly connects and streams..Over the last year or so, the SONY network has become so bogged down that you now cannot watch ANY internet content, especially at prime time ( 8 - 10 pm) as it literally stops to buffer every 30 secs - 1 minute.Not only is that VERY annoying.. BUT..  As a result of 'cannot connect to network' type errors, we went and spent more money buying a new wireless router.THIS is the reason increasing numbers of people have said it has bad network connection, not because it can't connect to their wifi or anything wrong with their internet connection/network, but because the SONY network is down/busy.Waste of money.  Unless they release a firmware update to bypass SONY and connect directly to streaming services, I would NEVER recommend this."
753,"My lovely new Blu-Ray player stopped working two months after I received it.  Let's see... that works out to about $42.50 a month for a player that was used 5 or 6 times at the most.  This will definitely be the last Sony product I purchase.Sony quality used to be something you could count on.  Judging by this and a few other recent experiences with Sony products, Sony quality is now a farce."
754,"I bought a 2555LMT which came with a GTM 26 (3D Traffic) traffic cable. Used it on about a 500 mile round trip from the Dallas area to the Gulf Coast. No problems. Worked like a charm.So, I decided to buy the GTM 60 for the ""3D Traffic and Digital Traffic from the HD Radio Broadcasting System"" or, as another reviewer stated ""for the 'better' traffic"" capability.The other reviewer stated in his/her experience ""So far over a couple days, I've only had 2 signal bars of service for about 3 minutes. The rest of the time the traffic is either ""Searching for signal, receiver disconnected, or weak signal for 10 minutes (or longer).""Let me say ""ditto"" to that. I compared both the GTM 26 and the GTM 60 in road tests, driving over the same roads on a 5 mile round trip, here in the Dallas area. The GTM 26 performed great over the entire distance (mostly 5 green bars of traffic reception). The GTM 60 mostly displayed the same results as the other user's results--little or no signal, searching, a 9 minutes ""no signal"", etc.So much for the the two options of the GTM 60 purported capability of using either the Digital 3D (like the GTM 26) or the touted Digital HD 3D traffic capability.By the way, my software for the GPS is current as of 1-17-2012.I am waiting to hear from Garmin to see if an exchange will solve the problem  or if a refund is in order.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE (1-23-2012):After reporting the problems I have been experiencing with the GTM 60 vs my GTM 26 cable, and subsequently returning the GTM 60 to Garmin, I received the following reply from Garmin:""I am sorry that you were having issues with the GTM 60 cable.

755,"Totally dumb engineering. You either have to leave the thing plugged in ALL the time or go through a complicated power off procedure. Their tech support people don't know their own products and don't listen to you when you try and give them info. On top of which plug and play is a fantasy, I could never get to be &#34;found&#34; no matter how many times I turned the firewall on, off or what machinations I tried."
756,"UPDATE: Broke after 3 months of moderate use. It seems this is a design issue. Just like the other reviewers, the plastic band snapped while putting the headset on and they are now completely useless. Lowered my rating to 1 star.Old review:The sound quality for communication purposes is great. I wouldn't use them for watching movies though. My Sennheisers blow these out of the water in that aspect. This headset lacks bass, and the voices were a little washed out (when watching a BluRay disc). Skype calling was perfect though.I really like it when companies provide the user with options. I appreciate having the option to use either analog or USB for connectivity. In my case using the former would achieve the highest sound quality, because I would be able to connect the headset directly into my X-Fi sound card. However, using the USB adapter allows me to dedicate the headset to a specific application (i.e. Skype). For example, I am able to use my Sennheisers to watch movies and play games, but if I get a call on Skype I can simply put this other headset on and start talking without having to disconnect or connect any wires. Really convenient.They are comfortable so far, and I sure hope they continue to be so. That's a little surprising, because I typically find the behind-the-head design very uncomfortable."
757,"In trying to hook up my older DVD players (2) to my new Samsung LED LCD TV with these &#34;adapter&#34; cables, going from Component RCA terminals on the DVD players to HDMI input sockets on the TV, I just get no signal detected windows on the TV screen.  I just hooked up one player using the video/audio inputs instead."
758,Worked great for about a week. Then the cable separated from the soldering. Also cable didn't have the 90 degree angle shown in picture. Cheap china cable. Spend a few more bucks and get something else.
759,"I would rate this router with NEGATIVE stars if it were possible. The setup is beyond stupid. Here's what happened: It took a very long time to download updates. Then, the setup program sent me though a few simple steps. Except that they did not work! The router would not connect to the internet. So, I clicked on the help and it gave me the dire warning that my entire computer system might melt down and end life on earth as we know it if I mess with the advanced settings.I could see no alternative to this and know quite a bit about the setup for my old linksys router, so I took a deep breath, and clicked the button. Guess what? The setup program tried to open a browser window! How's that going to work? Because of the new router, I have no internet, so the router software sends me to the internet for help. What a concept! That makes me think about shorting CSCO!I did find a pdf help file on the included disk. And the program the setup disk installed on my computer. None of these contain any helpful information to solve the problem of no internet connectivity. I tried rebooting and resetting the router and turning my modem off for a while. I even disconnected everything and later, reconnected it.What a piece of junk!"
760,"I'm running this on an HP Windows XP laptop. Having used it for about 20 hours, it's lost the connection 3 or 4 times. Having to open the Windows bluetooth applet to reconnect is a pain.I opened a ticket with Gigabyte and a response was received in good time. They want to know what applications I'm using it with. Well let me see, MS WORD, Chrome, IE...That does it! It's going back.Shouldn't a mouse just work? Regardless of application?"
761,"To explain my review, I was in no way expecting any major quality sound from this product. My exectations were quite low. I currently use this product:http://www.Company A.com/Altec-Lansing-VS2621-Channel-Speaker/dp/B0025VKUQQ/ref=cm_cr-mr-titlewith an adapter, not exactly BOSE surround sound.Since using the computer speakers is a bit clunky I thought that the bar that fit under my new 50 in plasma would be an unobtrusive space saver. Unobtrusive it is, until you turn on the sound. What came out sounded like it was trapped in a box through a tinny megaphone. The measly sound from the tv was an improvement.Another issue is that this product comes with its own remote. It says that it can do some smart work, but what that means is that it can read from your tv remote. However, since many of us have a cable remote that replaces the tv remote, it really defeats the purpose because what you end up with is yet another remote.It took me about 10 minutes of fiddling before I popped it back in the box for a return."
762,"My computer freezes after a while when connected to this router, the router freezes at the same time. Internet stopped working. Wireless stopped working. Restarting router won't solve it. I have to reboot or shut down my computer for the router/internet to work again. Computer no longer freezes when connected to old router. I'm returning this open-box item."
763,"Very upset camera dead after 14 months.....2 months past warranty.  This camera has been in a protective camera case, never dropped and never exposed to any damaging weather.  No one takes better care of their equipment than I do.  It locks up and you can not use it.  The only way to get it to come back on is remove the battery....totally toasted. With accessories I have in excess of $500.00 tied up in a brick.  Would I buy another one....H*LL no!"
764,THIS DEVICE HAS A BAD PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. THIS IS NOT MADE FOR THE &#34;NEW iPAD&#34; WITH RETINA DISPLAY1-The magnets do NOT turn off the device when the folio is closed.2-The rear-facing camera does not line up with the case holes that were made in the folio.
765,"Although this case provides ample protection for your device that is the only positive thing I can say about it. The stylus holder is a cheap little elastic strap; and if you push your stylus clip too far into the strap it is a pain to get back out. I understand that leather needs to be broken in, but this is way too stiff. However if you have the patience to break it in, go for it. Also; the zipper sticks and hags up on the holder for your device. The case also feels too bulky and heavy. Lastly, the stand on the back of the case does not support it well. It kept folding under, even on a sturdy desk top. I do not recommend this case. You can get one on Company A with a built in blue-tooth keyboard for the same price or less."
766,when I plugged the power adapter into it the jack fell inside the unit.product is very poorly made.I sent it back. Company A was great in handling the return.

It wasn't a good deal in the end and it certainly didn't save me any money.If you are considering this product, be sure to make sure it's returnable."
770,"Apple products are smart enough to know when they're being hooked up to something that might harm them.  Such was the case with the PowerGen charger designed for Apple and Android devices.An iPhone4, yes.  An iPhone5 or an iPad4, not so much.  Both devices warned that the charger was not safe and that no charging would occur while connected to it.  Disappointed."
771,"I have a lot of gadgets, and I use (and lose) more than my fair share of cases.  So, it's safe to say I'm no stranger when it comes to the unique fragrance of neoprene and other synthetic plastics and rubbers.  And yet, this case has, by far, the strongest, most persistent chemical smell of anything I've ever used.  I've run it through my washing machine (as another reviewer suggested), and tried hand-scrubbing it with dish soap, laundry detergent, kitchen cleaner, and every other cleaning solution I could get my hands on.  Still, the smell remains strong enough to taint my kindle, my hands, the bag I carry it in, and everything it touches.I'm not a sensitive person when it comes to this sort of thing, either.  The amount of purely positive reviews for this sleeve makes me think that the manufacturer might have different batches of materials, maybe?  If this thing didn't burn my eyes, I could see how it'd be a wonderful case: perfect fit, great stitching, thin, tough material.  But, given how unbearable it's been carrying this sleeve around, it boils down to a 1-star trip to the dumpster."
772,I got magicjack plus with a promise that i can port my number to magicjack.  I already paid for 5 years service and since August 2012 It does not allow me to port my vonage no to magicjack and everytime when I chat with live operator (as magicjack only has live chat does not have any contact no for customer services) they tell me that my account is under review and need no worry about they can request for speed up review but since 14 months this review haven't completed yet. I requested to cancel this no and give me my refund back they say they can't provide me refund as long as my account is under review.  Update from 11/27/2013 still can't port or modify my magicjack no.  This is a scam run by magicjack do not fall into trap.  I don't even give them 1 star but I am required to select this option.
773,"OK this is a great product, or WAS until it expired, 22 days after the Company A return date.  I bought it June 6th and it suddenly stopped working July 28th.  I looked for customer support on the CREATIVE web page and found this:  Service Unavailable.  It feels like I tossed a hundred bucks down a hole.  Without a support link to the company, or a number to call I guess I have an expensive paper weight.  If there are any folks out there who've encountered this I'd love to hear from you, especially if you know how to get creative on the phone....I sent their sales staff an email hoping they will respond.  I will try to update this post if I hear anything.July 28Yesterday I found this link: http://us.creative.com/.  The tech support tab functioned and I received an RMA with little effort for the card. Creative responded via email after hours and on a Sunday which impressed me.March 12I got my refurbished card back and eventually put it back into my machine. It works without incident."
774,"I've read all the reviews, mixed though they are, but decided to give this DVR a try. After receiving it, I took the DVR out of the box and placed it where it will sit in my long stand. It kills me that it even uses an AC adapter, why not make the unit bigger and use a regular AC cord? Anyway, I dug the wall wart out of the box and tried to figure out how to get the prongs to spring out so I could plug it in and get power to the unit. Nothing in the instructions on this! Instantly I noticed two metal clips on the back of the wall wart which fell off when I merely touched them but I still didin't put two and two together, until I wrote Channel Master tech support and a guy answered me saying the AC adapter came in two pieces, there was another piece that clips on to the back of the adapter that has the AC prongs. I rummaged through the box and found another little bag with that missing piece, attached it but guess what? Because those metal clips were gone, there's no electrical contact hence the wall wart is dead as a doornail. I don't have a spare with the same voltage and amperage rating so I'm dead in the water. If I don't hear from Channel Master today with an offer to overnight me a new wall wart, I'm sending this back to Company A. Heck, I don't know if this is going to be an omen of things to come with the unit. I hate not having a DVR but it's no good if I'm going to be looking at multiple problems. Keep in mind here, I am partially sighted, so I have to look at everything magnified. I'm electronically and technically savvy, but a wall wart like this is not visually intuitive and there was nothing in the paperwork that came with the unit to tell me to even go looking for a second piece to the adapter. Kinda cheap, dontcha think? So just in case there are other ""dummies"" out there like me, be forewarned about the wall wart upfront. I can't even comment on the other points of this unit since it's not getting power but if I do by chance keep the unit I'll update this review. I wish I could give this a proper review and was so looking forward to doing just that.Oh and what's this I see, even with all these reviews the price has just gone up? I paid $399 for mine, now it's $429? How can they even justify raising the price on the unit with so many issues cited?"
775,"The slots allow dust to accumulate on the lens as well as on the backside of any filter mounted in the adapter ring. This gives you three dusty surfaces rather than just one. The slots allow stray light - any stray light behind the plane of the filter - to pour through and reflect onto the backside of any filter you have mounted. Lamps, light sources, reflections from your shirt, etc. This causes reflections (regardless of anti-reflection coatings) that can fog-out parts of images. [I have no doubt that this is the cause of at least some of the reports of ""orbs"" that many users experienced with the X10 when it was introduced].For these reasons I can't recommend this product. If you can find one like it without the slots, go for it. Otherwise just get an appropriate adapter ring or one of the 40mm filters available."
776,"This didn't work. Wasn't worth the trouble to send it back. try a different one. Or better yet, get an Android that has a built in USB or SD port."
777,"This drive is not that fast and it freezes the computer too. Copying files to this drive would get the same speed from any drive that is either SATA 3G, SATA 6G or even from a SATA adapter card. Imagine 5400 16mb on IDE speed. And let me tell you about installation of Adobe Master Collection CS5.5 after a clean OS installation. It would stop, freeze and even give an error message or two. Installing Adobe to other regular SATA drives is fine. It isn't just Adobe either. I don't think this drive is meant to be run as your Operating System if it freezes all the time like this and give this kind or read and write speed. My bios is set to AHCI for the SATA controller and running on the Intel driver for the IDE ATA/ATAPI controller so it isn't my computer that is causing the problems I just mentioned. Formatting the drive was easy. You can just use the latest Maxtor MaxBlast 5 and it will format fine. In fact they suggested that on their own website for formatting and cloning.This drive is going back this week as soon as I can clone the ISO onto another drive so that I don't have to reinstall everything. This is a great shame because I had great hope for this product. But then again Seagate has never been my favorite company for hard drives.P.S. I installed this on a desktop with BOXDH67BLB3 motherboard, a 2600k CPU and 16 gb of RAM. The hard drive was connected directly to a SATA 6G port on the motherboard which showed no sign of the kind of speed I was expecting from the spec this drive supposed to have."
778,"The title says it all.  If you buy these test them properly.  If they pass great if not the low price is no bargain.  I wanted them to work bad I tried reseating, changing he order, but no luck.

779,Respectfully i should have known. I photograph weddings and you just cant have this type of thing. Held me back 1.2 the time. Most annoying camera purchase yet.

784,"This should have come with the kindle, we should not have to pay extra after we pay the price for the kindle and having to buy other pieces to go with the kindle fire or the kindle h.d."
785,"Company A should include this charger with the Kindle.  The fact that they're charging us extra for something that should be included is a sign of cheapness.  Plus, you can use any micro-USB phone charger instead of this to charge your Kindle.  Save your money."
786,This is the second one of these chargers I bought that will not charge my kindle.  I have to resort to using the IPAD charger to charge my kindle.
787,"After I got my unit today I followed the instructions and got stuck after the initial setup. It would not allow me to set it up wirelessly because the firmware (1.8) is buggy. Their forum suggested I downgrade the firmware and others said this works well. So, I go to use a local connection vs. the network connection and nothing I tried would allow a local connection to this camera.LIKE MY DAD ALWAYS TOLD ME, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.Back in the box it goes and I will get a refund and buy a better brand that has fully tested firmware in it.BTW, the image quality on this camera absolutely stinks (even after removing the protective film from the camera lens)."
788,"I had very high hopes for this product.Installation and Setup was easy. The downfall was the Execution. It simply FAILED. In ALL aspects. I am VERY Tech Savvy and this product to put it as simply as I can without violating Company A's TOS for Review's is a Piece of ""crap"".It touts itself as being able to attach to an external Hard Drive and maintain an Online Cloud backup of all your files. One of their Product Taglines is 'We Challenge You to set up PogoPlug in 60 Seconds or less"". Umm I challenge you to put out a Product that even if it take me 5 mins to setup actually WORKS as described,.I was using am Apple iPhone 4s, a Midnight Studio Company E Laptop and my Home Internet that connects at 30+ MBps so the issues weren't on my end"
789,This modem is *shit*. It turned my 50 Mbit connection into a **barely** 1.5 Mbit connection (less than 150 kB/sec!) It feels like it's 2000 all over again :O
790,"I bought this item to extend my wifi range to my garage. I got to the first screen where I entered admin and admin for username and password (defaults). The second screen only loaded halfway, that is, the right side of the page was visible but the left side was totally missing. Nothing could be entered or clicked on at this point. After resetting the repeater and rebooting the laptop I attempted this again with the same results. The screen after the login page would only load the right half of the screen and you couldn't type or click anything after that. After 1.5 hours of trying this was as far as I ever got. The page after the login screen would never completely load. Returned item, will not be buying another."
791,Couldn't get this to work even when placed next to computer.  Certainly wasn't going to work across the house.  For an non-computer engineer I would rate my technical ability much above average- so this is probably not user error but flawed design.
792,The camera arrived severely damaged in two places. Impossible to miss this damage. The box of the camera was obviously opened (tape seal removed). This was not a new item. Returned.
793,I ordered two of these as they were the FTDI chipset.  These are PROLIFIC chipsets 0x2303/ 0x067b not FTDI hardware. This makes a huge difference if you are looking for a stable USB/Serial adapter on your OSX Mountain Lion machine.
794,"No range, set up not as easy as stated. Poor range. Plus it has very sorry range. Oh yea, did I mention that the range was very weak?"
795,I give one star for this flash because it worked fine for less than 24 hours.I took less than 100 shots with it. It worked fine and I was very satisfied with it. But suddenly the only thing it could do was to turn on and off. No other button was responding anymore. I did some research on the net and found that a lot of people was complaining about the same issue. It seems to be a malfunction.Yongnuo speedlights no more! :(
796,"Doesn't work with Gotomeeting, doesn't work with Google Play. I was under the impression it would work with the google market, but the market was upgraded to Google Play, so now it wont work. It will not work with Gotomeeting at all."
797,"Every time 3590 unit starts, it demands I accept all Gamin license terms.  Once is enough, three time in 3 starts is enough to send back to Company A.Company A reviews led me to expect long maps & software update before use.  What I found is Garmin demanding I run Windiz to connect a Linux based 3590 to Garmin web.  No way to get updates then install or copy to 3590, no I must install Garmin software in my computer to use 3590.  Wait, did I not buy a stand alone GPS mapping device?  Why must I use Windiz to update a Linux based Garmin?  My Linux systems connect to Garmin 3590 OK, but Garmin requires me use Windiz to connect.  Grrr!  Installed Windiz driver, tried to update unit, only got web pages demanding install driver again & again.So far I see no updates, only pages offering to sell me software & maps I expected to be in premium unit when delivered.Oh, they also want me to buy software to publish my hikes, my physical training & such.  Maybe you like that.Maybe on trip from Gulf of Mexico to WY, it will prove better than Google maps on Nexus 4 phones.  So far it lags 2 blocks behind @ 30 M/H and shows my house address as a vacant lot a block away.Fourth start of 3590 did not demand another acceptance of license.  Only demanded I not use while driving.  I tried to get route to Denver CO.  Failed.  Had to select search for &#34;Cities&#34;, failed again.  Why is &#34;Denver, CO&#34; or &#34;Denver Co&#34; not enough to find Denver Colorado?This thing had one chance to shine when we get where no cell phone service is available but it did not get that far.  I am buying a mapping program & finding my old GPS receiver before beginning trip.  Having used GPS receivers with mapping programs in computers since 1993, I find this unit may be a fine telephone remote but not a useful travel tool.If you have no use for laptops, no experience with Map n Go program, never used trip-maker software, this unit might please you.  And it might be a fine hands free telephone remote!"
798,"I first ordered this product several weeks ago. After it arrived I installed the card and driver. It didn't work.  I emailedAnker support, they failed to respond in a timely manner. I then contacted Company A and wrote an unfavorable reviewon this product. Company A issued me an immediate refund and I returned the card to them. Anker responded to theunfavorable review by sending me a new, different card. This one also didn't work. I have since ordered anotherUSB 3.0 card from another manufacturer. Maybe this one will work."
799,"Unfortunately, I am having to return the unit AND pay return shipping because of inaccurate product information. I noticed that Company A no longer has any language addressing the TV upgrade option and Datacolor has updated the locations that indicated this option under their product description(s) as well.  However, it is still listed on Datacolor's Spyder4 comparison chart ([...]) -woops, they missed one.I have had numerous interactions and keep getting interesting responses.  I finally was told ""spring"" essentially and have seen production photos of the software. I didn't purchase this with the intention to let the warranty wane as they ""work on"" developing software.  So, I have sent the unit back to grow some more.  Also, fyi, the Colorimeter is the same for all levels.  This was a burning question that took a bit of work to find out too. I also understand that the TV version of the unit will have a new adapter for placing it near the screen correctly and not using the suction cup (which might damage some displays).  I haven't received any information as to when this part will be available.The unit seems to have a lot of potential, but the upcoming TV software was explained to REALLY be focused at the consumer market.  Not sure what that means exactly, since I keep asking if the white balance and other unique settings are part of the TV calibration workflow and they keep repeating that statement -It may be as simple as some displays don't allow user access to advanced menus to make these adjustments, or maybe simply no. Enjoy the journey, information is not cheap when it takes more effort to figure it out than use it."
800,So I spent the money bought the Toshiba and of course the preloaded software would not load. The Toshiba tech would not help me but kept apologizing for his inability to help. Then I told him that I wanted to file a complaint for which he put me into the abyss and never returned. So today I tried to get someone from Company A found that the Toshiba laptop is now 20.00 cheaper and the software still doen't work. I guess my IT guy will have to go through it at my expense. Toshiba likes to sell but they don't like to service.Toshiba where is your customer service???ktl frustratedJust spoke to Company A they not only made the price reduction but they contacted Toshiba directly. Company A didn't waste any time resolving this issue today. Unfortunately Company A has to mop up Toshiba's poor CS department.
801,"Like many others it seems these units are finicky. My usage needs are to connect USB 3.0 HDDs and a USB 3.0 Blu-Ray burner. I can't get 1 (Seagate) HDD and the burner to connect reliably and stay connected. Port #1 never seems to work for any device. Sometimes I get a blue LED on, sometimes I don't. And even with the blue light on I don't necessarily get a connection."
802,"No connection with Netflix or Company A, I either have no sound or no image or both... So I tried playing a DVD and does not work well either....I bought this on Feb of 2013 on sale for $99 at Target ( regular price $200) The previous DVD player last it 6 years and it was a lot less expensive ( in comparison) than this one.... What a shame Sony...."
803,"I bought the camera based on the very positive reviews from others, but unfortunately, I can't agree.  I found the shutter lag to be EXTREMELY annoying.  Taking the camera out of the box, it has a great, solid feel.  When you take pictures of still objects, the clarity is fabulous, and the zoom is the best I've seen.  But with the shutter lag, it seems to limit what you can do with the camera -- great for stills, not so great for any kind of live action.  When I took the camera to the zoo, I could rarely catch the pic when the animals are looking right at you; and even their movements (pretty slow, not like a sporting event) came out blurry.  I tried this in bright daylight, shutter priority, and several other settings.  My brother, who has a Canon 60D, also tried it and had the same feedback.  For the price, I would have expected faster."
804,this is not really a range extender - it is just a router that connects to your base router and provides a relay from your devices to your base router by this device with separate SSIDs so your home network would have MyNet-1 (your original) and MyNet-2 plus MyNet-3 for the new dual band extender. The thing is that most newer routers would let you do the same thing.
805,"Had to return this item as it only works with apple products, we have windows computers!  Do not buy this unless you have an apple computer!"
806,"I can see that most customers are happy with the product. That was not my experience.  I knew what I was buying - tablet for temporary notes, which you cannot save, but you can leave a note for somebody at home, which can be easily erased and does not waste paper. I was using is probably one or twice in a week, and it stopped working (stopped erasing) in 3 months, probably literally after 15-20 uses. Considering that erasing is the only time you need a battery, I assume that battery died, and battery cannot be replaced (it's soldiered in, and if you try to remove it, you need pretty sharp knife, and the result probably will be ruined tablet anyway). As I'm looking at it, battery could be very easily made replaceable. I liked it while it lasted (though I cannot say I really needed it or that it was very useful), but that was very short-lived."
807,"I can define this camera with one word... Manual, i compared it with several cameras.. and this is very manual you can adjust a lot of things, like aperture, shooting time, iso, you can play with this options to create great pictures... you arent limited by the scenes like ""fireworks, beach, night scene"" you can create your own scene depending in what you want... you can get a lot of effects... i am a fujifilm s4000 user, and this camera its the same, just have less lcd resolution, and the texture of the case... i cant stay quiet and knowing that there is people watching this camera and doesnt know what they can do, or why this is better than others cameras like l810...so if you are an amateur, pro, or you want to learn more about photography i think this camera will help you, has a lot of manual settings... and 30 x zoom! perfect for baseball, soccer games... to make a movie zooming the players, taking moon photos.this camera has an electronic viewfinder... very usefull in sunny days... very nice, i think you should try with fuji... i read a lot and bought s4000 3 month ago, im very happy... try fuji!"
808,"Careful in reading reviews.  This item is a hit or miss.  My old legacy desktop could not be recognized by this A-B switch.  So, I changed to a wireless printer, when I wanted to connect the laptop and desktop.  Oh yeah, that is a few bucks -- if a miss.  Unit looks nice, and most likely works on newer desk tops.  But why?  Just get a wireless printer.  Duh!!!"
809,"Summary: Foscam is manufacturing and selling cameras with a known manufacturing defect. If the camera is pointed at a scene with too much detail (trees, grass, wood grain, window screen, etc) the camera will fail by either freezing, displaying black or rebooting. This defect was introduced as the result of a sensor change in December 2012. It was first reported by users to Foscam in May of 2013. Foscam publicly confirmed this manufacturing defect as the DSP in December 2013 and they also put a repair procedure in place. This procedure involves shipping the newly purchased camera to a distributor in Texas for repair. I've personally sent two cameras in for repair; the first repair took 15 days and required a significant amount of effort to process including a BBB complaint. The second repair took 18 days to turn around and was processed easily. Oddly, the serial number of this second camera changed before/after the repair so they seem to have sent a different camera instead of repairing. Regardless, the camera now works. Other users have reported varying amounts of friction when attempting to process these repairs.This DSP problem is widespread among Foscam cameras. Many users potentially have cameras with the defect but do not observe the effects because the camera is not pointed at a scene with enough detail to trigger the fault. Other users may observe the defect but incorrectly identify the problem as cabling or other networking gear. At last check, 423 faulty cameras have been reported in the Foscam forums. These forums detail this defect extensively, and also offer a DIY solution for users brave enough to open the camera up and fab a custom USB cable to interface with the DSP. This forum thread can be found by doing a web search for ""MJPEG Cameras hanging rebooting based on image data."" The defect is reproduced by many users with a variety of Foscam models.A review has been posted to each of these confirmed models. This includes Foscam models 8904, 8905, 8906, 8910, 8916, and 8919. However, be aware that the defect may exist on additional models as well. Company A is aware of these details being documented on multiple reviews for different models. Please see the update at the bottom of this review for more information regarding this.Foscam currently claims that all cameras purchased from specific retailers as of November 2013 have the issue 100% resolved. Unfortunately, the forums show 111 faulty cameras reported from 11/1 through 12/10. To be fair, some users have reported purchasing non-faulty cameras and hopefully this will continue. But other users (as of February 2014) continue to report new cameras from these specific retailers with the defect. Unfortunately, purchasing a Foscam camera continues to be a gamble.There is a relatively simple way to verify if a specific camera has the DSP bug. The Foscam web GUI has the option to capture a snapshot. Faulty cameras that have the DSP bug are not able to capture a snapshot greater than ~60K. If a camera is able to capture a snapshot above this threshold then it does not have the bug. If the snapshot is smaller than 60K then the current scene does not have enough detail to verify if the bug is present. The camera will need to be pointed at a more complex scene and tested again until a snapshot greater than ~60K is achieved or failure is observed. Faulty cameras that have been repaired by Foscam can also capture above the ~60K threshold.I do not recommend buying this camera, or any other Foscam MJPEG camera unless you want to gamble with this known and confirmed freezing/black/rebooting problem. Based on the quality of support I recommend staying away from all Foscam cameras in general. They are inexpensive, but your time and sanity are worth a far greater value.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Foscam posted a response to this review. If you are seeking additional information, my comments on the response are below::::Foscam US, thank you for the response. I have been close to this issue since the defect was first brought to Foscam's attention in May and this is the first public acknowledgement that I am aware of. Previously this had only been acknowledged privately through email/phone. As there are currently 62,997 views on this topic in the Foscam forums and over 400 reported faulty cameras I'm glad that there is now an ""official"" acknowledgement of this defect.I do contend with some of the statements you provided as these statements do not match the current experience from actual users.----------------------------------Foscam US - ""all cameras currently sold by Foscam US through the Foscam US website as well as through Company A.com direct and the Company A store ""Foscam Digital Technologies LLC"" have the issue 100% resolved as of November 2013""----------------------------------This is simply not true. Users continue to report faulty cameras from these sources. It is also worth noting that several times over the last 7 months Foscam support told users (privately over email/phone) that the defect has been fixed and newly purchased cameras will function correctly. Regardless of these statements by Foscam, users continue to report defects. Data from 11/01 through 12/10 shows that 111 additional faulty cameras have been reported since November 1. Time may show otherwise, I hope it does, but currently this statement is simply not true.----------------------------------Foscam US - ""Furthermore, Foscam US (not the manufacturer which is Foscam China) is willing to replace any cameras free of charge (shipping cost covered both ways) which are suffering from this defect""----------------------------------This is also simply not true (unless this policy very recently changed). I have 50+ emails back and forth with Foscam support detailing exactly how difficult it is to process the repair. My experience was not unique, as other users have reported similar experiences. Since 8/23 there have been 7 BBB complaints; overall the BBB gives Foscam a D rating. However, if these policies have recently changed then I applaud the decision to reverse Foscam's previous policy. (Company A Review Update: Credit where credit is due, my second repair was processed smoothly so this process may indeed be getting easier)Bottom Line:1) Foscam's response claims that cameras sold from specific retailers have the issue resolved as of November 2013. This is simply not true based on consumer reports.2) The response also claims that Foscam US will replace faulty cameras free of charge. If that is true, then that is a change in policy and a step in the right direction. However, many users outside of the US are also reporting faulty cameras. Unless the manufacturer (not simply a US distributor) steps up to repair the cameras, then these international users are still without a repair solution for their faulty cameras. Foscam the manufacturer needs to assist users in correcting this defect.--The referenced data and user experiences above are detailed in the Foscam forums and from the BBB.--::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Update Regarding Multiple Reviews ::::On 2/17 a version of this review was pulled-down from the Foscam 8919 listing. I asked Company A to review the removal. Company A performed a review (Megan, Kath and Kai specifically) and relisted the review unmodified on 2/20. In an effort to preempt any future problems I have modified some reviews for other affected Foscam models to point to the full details on this review. However, to be clear, Company A approved the relisting as-is. Thank you to Company A for taking the time to have humans evaluate this review in the context of my other reviews and to relist. It is always good to see a system/process that works as intended."
810,i've been using this device for 6months now and all of the sudden it has a tremendous amount of video 'noise' in the form of green dots.  i've attempted to contact support via their web site but it went nowhere.  i've left an email to their support contact and still no acknowledgement that they've received it and will get back to me in 'x' days.  just silence.i've tried all sorts of config/setup changes.  it just all of the sudden went to look like crap and there is no response from support.i thought of maybe doing (2) stars as it does somewhat work but it just sux that i've dropped a hundred bucks on a disposable device and not sure i want to gamble on their new HD model just released unless i can get some kind of response from their support team.below are the screenshots of a sample video i can see with and without the IR turned on.[...][...]Device Firmware Version  11.22.2.46Device Embeded Web UI Version  2.4.10.2
811,"I bought this camera back in November. It was working well until this weekend when it just died. No power, no connection,  nothing. I did all the appropriate troubleshooting and it all posts to failure of the camera. I emailed the manufacturer directly and got no response from them either. Beware, this camera is faulty.  It's no surprise they are selling these on Group-On and other discount sellers for much less than suggested retail."
812,"This is a waste of time and money.  The package contained the screen guard but nothing else, not even instructions.  I went to the website and reviewed the installation instructions.  The instructions state to lift dust off the iPad using the &#34;dust film&#34; (I did not receive this but I thoroughly cleaned my iPad with a a microfiber cloth).  This film was so sticky and seemed to magnetically attract dust.  I tried applying it and reapplying it multiple times and it did not line up correctly.  In addition, it collected so much dust during the process that it was useless.  Re:  Lifetime guarantee?  I emailed Sir Lancelot's and the response was when we receive your returned screen proector we will contact you to offer you a refund or a replacement.  Are they kidding?  First of all, the item was missing parts  (bubble card, instructions, and dust film).  I'm supposed to package up and mail a useless Item I purchased for $6.95?  Then, I wait until they contact me after my return is received to find out if I want a replacement or a refund?  Then if I chose a replacement, I have to wait even longer to receive it?  With the Tech Armor guarantee, they immediately ship out a replacement (no need to ship back an unusable item) and in my case they threw in an extra product!  I will not be giving Sir Lacelot my money again,"
813,"This device is junk. All ports will work with USB 2.0 items, all the USB2 ports will work with USB 3.0 devices, but put a KNOWN WORKING USB 3.0 device on one of the two 3.0 ports, bam!- doesn't recognize device or 'last USB device installed is defective'. Really just a waste of $30. And of course, I threw away the packaging.I have a $50 USB3.0 7-port hub, item AK-68UNHUB-B7U, and it works without issue, 2 or 3."
814,"I bought this to use with my iPad 2 as an office charger.  Because I rarely used my iPad at work I rarely had a need to charge it at work, so I used it only two or three times before it failed. It became too hot to touch and was blinking rapidly on and off.  After that - nothing. Dead. Piece of junk."
815,"I tried to post this review from apples site but was removed constantly.I spend 3000 bucks for this stupid mac book pro retina display and it does not function well? Everything lags. I went to genius bar and they say my hands are tied and wait for update to see if that fixes. I should not have bought apple!The problems are:1) The wifi does not work2) The wake up screen freezes too long3) The noise of graphics card is too huge when watching movies4) When I slide between the desktop it freezes atleast sometime before it come backs to normal5) The safari is the worst browser.a)  It lags when you scroll in safarib)  Lately, when I open safari and slide between the deskstops it takes foreever as if the trackpad is not  working.c)  It keeps logging me out of facebook.d)  It is dirupting the display when you scroll the pages.6) When I try to use mission control it simply lags very ugly.7) The battery performance is worst. It not even close to 7 hrs as in advertisement.8) Its not even quieter when I watch movies or any other applications as told in advertisement.9) I did not have credit card so I did not make apple account so when I formated my computer as directed by the apple customer care I had to buy OS X mountain lion againg.And I spend 3000 bucks for this laptop and when I go to genius bar they expect me to just listen they can't help anymore. Why did I even buy this thing?"
816,"Had a couple of problems with this TV and called Samsung for help.  I asked for a replacement for a defective POWER CORD and was sent - by VERY SLOW POST a remote control.  When I called to have THAT replaced, I was told I had to wait another 2 weeks.  The Closed Captioning didn't work.  I was told that if the program I was watching didn't have CC, I wouldn't get it.  Really?  Gosh.  According to the TV, ZERO programs on television in 2013 had Closed captioning.  That info was given to me by a supervisor.  Another ""Customer Service"" rep told me it was up the cable company to activate the CC capabilities.  Really?  After several phone calls over a couple of days, I decided to cut my losses and return the SAMSUNG for another brand.  ANY OTHER BRAND.  IF Samsung had reliable Customer Service, I probably would have kept it, but when you have to deal with people who are less knowledgeable than I am (and as far as electronics go, I am in about 3rd grade), well, it's time to cut my losses.  I'd recommend you not waste your time either.  Get another brand."
817,"The remote, which is the most frustrating thing in the world, must be used. The &#34;play&#34; button (oddly located atop the machine) opens the root menu. On most players, just pressing &#34;play&#34; again would play the movie...but why do that when you can show off a wireless &#34;mouse&#34; remote that sucks? After discovering that the remote centers where the player is located, NOT the TV, you are now free to point wherever the PLAY button would be located in proportion to the Blu-Ray player, if the Blu-Ray player were the TV screen. Don't look at me like I'M crazy, this obviously all made sense to the technological geniuses at Panasonic! As far as going into the menu to either select sound field or captioning functions, all I can do is warn not to do it, or you will NEVER RETURN! Also, your Blu-Ray movies no longer contain any special features. Just remember that, you'll thank me later. Better yet, avoid this player and thank me now. You're welcome!"
818,I choose this camera for wifi transfering high quality compact digital camera. Overall picture quality is not bad but not as great as other compact cameras. This camera only support micro SD card for reducing its body size but it is not smaller than my TX10. Basically micro SD card is not fast as regular SD card. UI is a kind of big issue for this camera. It is very slow and hard to touch. iphone or android smart phones touch feeling is absolutely better. LCD is a little past age feeling and hard to touch buttons and all menus are hidden so really need to get used with its menu system.And I don't know black one but this white color camera's material is matted so easy to get dirt or scratch.
819,have a older computer use only for printer and purchased product but unable to hook it up a waste of money
820,"First, let me say that I do not own this cover, so this isn't a firsthand review of it.However, having seen so many negative reviews, and having been looking for a case for my new iPad3, I did a little research and found this article.[...]""MacOtakara also reported that Apple has made changes to the magnetic sensor that interacts with the Smart Cover to put the new iPad to sleep, though Apple's own Smart Covers still work with the device.""However, since the position or sensitivity of magnetic sensor was changed, 3rd party's cover which has magnetic sleeping feature may not work perfectly,"" the report read.Danbo pointed out that Apple has yet to outline the changes in its ""Dimensional Drawings"" resource on its developer website, so case makers will have to do their own research to identify the exact nature of the changes.""So, to summarize, most, if not all, third-party ""smart"" covers that worked with iPad2, will NOT work with iPad3 because Apple changed the magnetic sensors.Hope this helps save people some agony."

822,I bought one of these before and their included software offered a free copy of Norton Ghost. I wasted some time downloading and a CD only to discover that it was a LIE when I tried to use the CD and was prompted for a key. A call to Samsung verified that it was basically false advertising.

824,"Doesn't work out of box,turns on for few seconds then turns off. Do you not check these before you re-sell them. I expect that when I order used electronics on eBay I will more than occasionally get something that doesn't work, but I never expected this from Company A and that they have no contact info for the seller seems very not legit. As I am disabled hooking this up is tiring and painful but to have do it twice for the same order and then having to wait for a refund and then order a replacement, and then wait for delivery, and go through pain of hooking up again not knowing whether it will work out of box or not is very disappointing as I had expected better from Company A. Also I had to argue with customer service so I could get a replacement for the same price. I bought this through Warehouse Deals, Inc and fulfilled by Company A. I will right an update to this review every day for a year or until I get compensation for this ridiculous aggravation and as I am disabled and pretty much home bound if i miss a day I will try to over compensate regularly.

828,"I placed my pre-order for the Razer Tiamat Elite 7.1 gaming headset back in March and finally received it in September.  Out of the box, the headset was very impressive, at least that was what I believed at the time.  The sound was great and the microsphone worked perfectly.  The headset fit perfectly on my head and it worked great with my Asus DX2 sound card.  Playing games never sounded so good.  Clean separation of the 7.1 surround sound kept me happy playing my favorite PC games.  Only a few minor gripes that I had were that the indidual connectors need to be clearly marked as to which input they are for; Main (front & center) speakers, left/right side, rear left/right, subwoofer, and microphone.  I had to refer to the instruction sheet that came with the headphones to figure out which input pin went where on my sound card - pain in the butt!  And the pod controller itself does not provide backlighting for the individual settings as part of the volume control for the the separate speaker channels.  This would be a real pain at a LAN party as you would have to break out the flash light just to be able to see which channel was selected before adjusting the volume.So, I was really enjoying this headset until that fateful day...the microphone died and from that point on, my respect for Razer was lost forever.  I immediately began the process to RMA the headset back to Razer.  The first thing I found out in the RMA process is that Razer designed their website in such a way that finding out how to return a product was made very difficult to accomplish.  Once I was able to find the RMA process information off their website (had to use Google search to find it), I submitted the RMA request and about a day later I received an email from Razer customer support providing the necessary directions for fulfilling the RMA.  I mailed out the headphones a couple days later and several weeks later I received what I thought was either the repaired headset or a new headset.  I didn't receive either.  What I received was my headset that I had sent to them, but no repair had been conducted.  The microphone still did not work!  I knew there was no problem with my sound card because the Tritton 5.1 analog headsets I had sitting on my second gaming computer worked just find using it.  At that point, I knew that Razer had ultimately failed me.  What company would do that?  Not repair a headset that a customer paid $180 for?  Really?  I own a Corsair Vengeance 2000 headset, a Logitech G930 headset, a Tritton AX51 Pro headset, and Tritton PC510HDa headset, and can tell you now that the Razer Tiamat has by far the worst customer support!  And let's talk about the crappy build quality of the Tiamate headset.  After being frustrated about received my faulty headset back from Razer, I decided to take it apart.  What I found was very disturbing.  The build quality of the headphone portion was extremely poor.  Cheap plastics were used everywhere and everything was held together by glue.  I found out quickly that the screws that are visable on the exterior of the headset were in fact fake.  Razer has done a horrible job enforcing the build quality of this headset.  I paid $180 for this crap?  Yup.  Razer, you want me back as a customer?  You had better send me a free replacement headset!"
829,"Within a week or so it started playing CDs erratically and with background noise. The music fades in and out and you can hear the motor through the speakers. Also, the switch that turns the player on CD or radio is not very well designed. I used to buy the Coby brand without problems, but I don't see them anymore so I tried this brand. If I had the original box and stuff I'd try and return it, but I'm not going to go through that hassle over $30. I'll buy one at Best Buy or Target so I can return it easily if I have a problem."
830,"This product did not work. Don't bother buying it. I found a second solution which was purchasing a second router and setting it to &#34;Repeater mode&#34; and connecting the main router to the second router. Granted, this means I have a long wire traveling from end of my apartment to the other, but this is preferable to no internet..."
831,"i should've known this this would be as locked down as it is. The main reason I chose it was because its HBO Go app works with comcast, while roku's does not (which is completely retarded and another discussion altogether). The quality of said HBO Go was was worse than I could imagine. Netflix's HD offerings look pretty damned good, so that's what i was expecting from a premium channel's stream. Anyways, this box might be good, if I had more money than brains and wanted to waste it on itunes videos, which are only useful in the apple ecosystem. Not sure what idiots pays these prices for something they can't lend, trade, give away, or sell. I guess the same is true of ALL drmed video. At least with discs, I'm capable of doing what i want with them. Another thing I hated was the sparseness of channels. I'd expect more big players like Company A Instant Video to be available, but nope. The plusses I can think of are that it works well with my iphone, the airplay thing seemed cool, until you realize how many apps (like Company A Instant Video) are crippled to not work. That, and i can stream all my music, but have to have itunes open to do so. Overall,  if you leave and breathe Apple, thus might be a good deal, but not if you want any sort of value."
832,"works on a single circuit, very low bandwidth when it does decide to work. Seriously, don't waste your money on these."
833,"If I could have given a zero star rating I would have. First of all this case had a bad odor to it. It was smelling up my apartment. I placed it on the patio  overnight and when I came home from work the smell was just about gone. 2nd of all it didn't even fit right. It would not close all the way. You had to force it to snap close. After forcing it to snap close for about a week, it broke and became extremely loose and then wouldn't even stay close. I got so frustrated with this dumb case I just threw the thing in the garbage. You get what you pay for. My advice is to not order this case. It's ill fitting and smells horrible."
834,"I've swapped this with a couple of other antennas to get a comparison and I think this thing is pretty worthless. I didn't pay much and will give it a try outside sometime, I've just used it in a few locations around the house. It wasn't competitive with any other antenna option I have and I'd return it if it was worth the time, at this price, it's probably not. You  know what? I haven't compared it to using no antenna at all - maybe it still has a chance to shine!"
835,TO ANYONE USING EYEFINITY!!This will not work. You need an Active Adapter.... this is not one. It will just do nothing. Don't buy this if you need it for Eyefinity.I am sure it would be good if you needed it for something that a PASSIVE adapter is all that is required. I would have given it 4 stars due to the lack of proper description. The one star is for the minimum of 3 other people that had this happen.
836,"I purchased this as a gift for someone to watch Netflix on this TV.Now, first let me say that the setup was a nightmare. I was always getting the same error connecting, and it seems it's because this device has a terrible Wifi reception. Do not buy this if you plan to use this somewhere where Wifi reception is not near perfect.This means only in the same room as your Wifi router or in the next room, if the TV is somewhere upstairs or further away forget it. Roku will not connect. I searched Google and it's quite common it seems.Now, I had to purchase another router which let me increase the signal power manually, even so when the reception was better, but it would not connect. So I went extreme for testing and turned off the Wifi security encryption which does reduce output when by default, and now Roku could connect after several retries.But now we have another problem. It seems when you turn the device off it will not reconnect again on startup. You do not turn this off usually I know, but if power is lost or for some reason you will have the same issues again reconnecting.After getting this device finally working I was shocked to know they require your credit card in order to use the device. Even when they mention it's free, and they only require it in case you need purchases, they actually do not let you signup and use it without entering one. So even for using with channels that are free as beer on the Internet, you still have to send your CC details out. So I was pissed already and now they require my CC cards for purchases which I will not use, (this was a gift) they should ask this details only when you plan to purchase something.Here comes the scam alert:After this setup nightmare, Netflix is nowhere to be found. Not even pressing the Netflix red button on the control. And neither anywhere else on the channels store. I contacted their chat and they said, Netflix is restricted and every other content in the country where it was installed.I said what?First, let me say that I do know that Pandora, Company A videos, etc. are not available when you travel outside the US, it's based on IP content restriction, but Netflix is not.Netflix works in some countries in Europe and Latin America. Yes, it's not the same US content, but it works. It works legally without a VPN, or proxy, or anything else. This person had a valid subscription and was paying just fine every month. Allot of other people use it on their PS3, Wii, phones, etc.But Roku decided Netflix is not available where they want, not where Netflix says. This is plain scam. Roku does not have the power to say where you can watch or not watch Netflix. If you have a valid subscription which you can use in your computer or anywhere else, Roku decides they will not let you use your valid paying subscription outside the US. This is totally false advertising in their product box and feature descriptions, not to mention they let you choose your country and language on the device, but then they decide to NOT let you use the only important thing why everyone is buying this, which is Netflix.So if you plan travelling, or giving this is a gift to somewhere, or you plan to buy and use this outside the US, be aware. Only crappy channels (all in English) are displayed. And most of them require extra payment. The only reason I purchased this was Netflix, as they even advertise Roku supports Netflix subtitles. So there you have it. Company A should put a notice here informing buyers about this. Because I think allot of people are buying this or are going to buy it, thinking they can use it for Netflix in Latin America, which they can't. And this is not a limitation from Netflix either, but from the company behind this device.Apple faced a lawsuit in Australia for advertising the iPad was 4G compatible. This is no different. They advertise Netflix as a big feature on this device, and then it's not available if you are not using it in the US. Did I mention they accepted the international credit card for the signup just fine? What does that tell you about Roku...For almost the same price just buy a normal Blue Ray player that will also stream Netflix without these stupid country restrictions. This is a rip off as nowhere it says they restricted Netflix per country, neither on their product sales information, neither in the box, nowhere !!!!"
837,It wouldn't output HDMI to my Viewsonic PJD5533 projector.  Everything worked fine connected directly to projector but not through the receiver.  I even upgraded to a Pioneer VSX-523 thinking it might work better since it's a year newer but it had a similar problems.  I eventually switched to an Onkyo and everything worked fine.
838,"First time I took these running the batteries died like 15 minutes into the run. I charged them when I got home overnight and again, 15 minutes in they are dead. Useless!"
839,Bought this tablet at one of the big box stores and used it for about 4 hours total before the screen decided to develop a large black/white area that looks like a closeup of a fungi - the menu screen is still visibile but lightened out.  At this point the tablet will not function at all.
840,Cheaply made and too expensive.  Found a better case at under at $17 vs $27. See CaseFlex leather stand.Also will stop buying items shipped from China. Cancellation charges are obviously meant to deter returns even if not what was expected at this price.Beware on this one.
841,"My experience with Logitech products has generally been pretty good.  But this MX Anywhere mouse has become a real pain, since it double click all the time now when I single click it, and it drop things that I try to drag.  I replaced a (Lt) M505 with this MX that developed the same issues.  The battery life on the M505 was much better (about 6 months) and I have to replace the MX (about ever 6 weeks). This mouse is supposed to have a two year warrantee but I've called the service number and I keep getting the run around. They say it's built up static but I know there is a problem with the thin copper reed switches that are using inside of the mouse,  After many click the reed looses it elasticity and therefore get fatigued and loose their shape.  There is a video on U Tube on how to repair the reeds. I'm sure that after a while the will need adjusting again.  &#34;Like the average guy I don't want to be taking a mouse apart fix it.&#34;---Fix the problem Logitech!  Don't give users the run around!"
842,I'm sure this is a reliable product unfortunately they did not match the specific requirements of my computer and I had to return them. It is entirely possible I ordered the wrong thing.
843,"Having already returned a similar coaxial coupler to Company A because it was smaller than a standard coaxial, I inquired customer service before ordering to verify that this part is a standard sized coaxial for connecting a standard coaxial wall plate to the coaxial on the back of the television (in order to define what is meant by ""standard size""). Based upon their reply, I was lead to believe that it was the correct part and placed my order. However, I was told after the order was marked as 'Shipped' that this is NOT for a standard sized coaxial, but for a SMALLER size.If you're looking for a standard size coaxial to connect a television coaxial 2-way splitter to a standard coaxial wall plate without having a bunch of cable, this is NOT the part. I would try eBay, as I found the part there (verified through order) but could not find it on Company A."
844,"OK, the bad news is I bought a 1605TM  on sale 3 months ago.The good news is I found a pile of broken glass in my driver seat and this GPS gone forever (I assume) this morning.Good Riddance!GPS's are the 2nd greatest invention in the last half a century (after the internet).  I had a couple of jobs picking up/dropping off parts a few decades ago, and really would have loved a GPS.  I shudder to think of past horrible times reading gas station maps by dome lights on a dark and rainy Seattle afternoon.I purchase a Tomtom about five years ago (920T), and loved it.  I loved it so much I purchased a 2nd one for my daughter.  I tried another one, but I liked the interface of Tomtom better, but that might be just because I am used to it.So, when I discovered I was being transferred from Seattle To San Antonio, I used it as an excuse to purchase a new GPS, as I figured five years of electronics technology should have resulted in a far better and cooler product.  And the features sounded great. I love the concept of getting real time traffic info, to dodge accidents, congestion.The 1605TM was a big step backwards (in most ways) though.BAD-1) Tomtom, in its wisdom, only allows you to have one product per e-mail address.  A stupid fillip, but I signed up for a new gmail address for the sole purpose of registering my 2nd Tomtom.  This means when I replace my stolen 1605 (with a different Tomtom product) I'll have to create yet a new empty e-mail address.  Just an extra stupid hoop to jump through.-2)  The screen is really slow to update.  Meaning I touch a button, and sometimes have to wait five or ten seconds for something to happen.  Press change destination, and think ""gee, nothing is happening"" and have press again, then suddenly both actions happen and I wind up at some random spot.-3)  Rather slow finding routes.  Not a big deal.  But it seems slower than my previous one.-4)  I was looking forward to the real time tracking.  However it does not work at all well.  There are two major North South routes near Seattle, I5, and 167/405.  When driving from Puyallup to Redmond, the route said there would be a 3 minute delay, and the trip would take 43 minutes.  It said that exact same thing for the entire 75 minutes it took to get there.  If the main North/South route is so far off, how accurate can other routes be?-5)  Points of interest have a lot of holes.  Out of about ten I've searched for, fully half were not in the system.  The first time I tried to find a point of interest (a theater that opened five years ago) it was not in the system.  Really, after five years?  I can see a restaurant that opened 3 months ago not being on it.  But it also lacked a medical building (I broke my foot a few months ago) built in 2005, and a Costco built in 2001.  So I don't know what points of interest they do put in there, but literally about half of the  I've tried to find were not in the map.-6)  I presume it has the typial horrible tomtom battery problems.  If I turn off the car, the unit forgets my planned route, and I have to re-enter it.EHHHI can't really say this is a bad point.  But...  My five year old Tomtom (920) had voice recognition. i.e. I could say the address and it did a fairly good job of understanding me.  A good feature if you are changing destinations on the fly.  So, OK, I assumed this one would have the ability to ""hear"" address input.  I was wrong.  Not that they say it does, so really it was my mistake.  But in an example of lazy or poor programming the software for this has a microphone voice input icon.  It does not do anything, must be a holdover from versions that do take audible commands.  So, yes, they do not say it takes voice command, but the fact that my five year old Tomtom 920 did, and this one omits the feature seems odd, especially since this one has an icon for it.GOOD+1)  It is a big screen.+2)  It does a good job warning about that horrible bane of modern society, the traffic camera.+3)  It is as customizable as my old GPS.  (i.e. you can put the options running on the side or bottom of the screen, allow for shortest, most economical, or fastest route, you can tell it to skip/allow/ask toll/carpool lanes, etc).+4)  Free lifetime maps are good, as long as it does not get stolen after a couple of months.I'm probably going to get another Tomtom because I am accustomed to the interface, but not a 1605TM.  My honest advice is to stay away.Edit>>  I've since gotten another Tomtom (different model, 2505) and the ""real time tracking"" (see point -4 above) works great (and is a feature I love).  So I presume there was something defective about the 1605 I purchased.  So maybe the downcheck should be for build or quality control rather than concept."
845,Auto sleep doesn't work on my iPad 3. The case is not a perfect fit and requires high force to insert. The case might have been an acceptable value if sleep worked. Both problems might not exist on iPad 2. The merchant is advertising a product that doesn't match the description.

849,"I bought this drive for my new Sony VAIO S.Long story short, the drive did not work. It's defective. Taking a look at OCZ Support forums, it seems that this is a common problem.Another piece of info I did not like - on the forum - is that connecting the drive to a SATA-USB bridge corrupts the firmware. What the heck !!!!!I am returning it and buying a Samsung which is the best (did not originally buy it since it was much more expensive, now it's almost the same price).Thanks God it happened before I entrusted the drive with my valuable data ......."
850,I bought this cable to use it with my MacBokPro and my LCD tv. Guess what? There's no sound!Even my Macbookpro is manufactured in 2010 the Mini Display Port still didn't work well.
851,"When you get the Bacpac out of the box, you have to do a careful series of firmware upgrades to your cameras and your bacpac in order to get it to even function; in the middle of this process, you need to reboot the machine doing the upgrades for no apparent reason.Once you do the dance of a thousand usb insert/removes, you have a not-as-advertised battery drain that adds almost no functionality to your camera. The remote is nice, but has a very limited range - about 10 feet. Forget any ideas you had of triggering dozens of widely-placed cameras, you'll be lucky to get one to work when you stand on top of it.The worst part is not only is there is no app for smartphone control, there is no schedule to actually ship one and no evidence that one is in development. The GoPro team appears to have rushed this out the door with no thought of consumers actually being able to use it; please spend your money elsewhere."
852,"the bottom and top did not fit well, to open and close the top part of my macbook there was slight difficulty; I had to put an extra effort to get pass the hinges. The top portion of the plastic overrode the bottom on the hinge section .. not good. Also on certain angles and depending the placement of my 11 inch macbook air on my lap the top portion of my laptop would just give and push itself all the way back."
853,I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.
854,"im so upset right now it just died , turned on my phone and all my movies pics music all gone. card just died after three months bullcrap."
855,"I bought these as an alternative to the OEM Canon batteries due to cost. When I read the reviews I felt confident they would work properly. They don't. They do not communicate with the camcorder, an HFR30, so the battery is useless for anything longer than 20 minutes. I get 30 minutes off of the stock battery! Save your time and hassle by not getting one of these. You spent good money on the camcorder so spend good money on a battery that will last.It was shipped quickly and securely so I have no problems with the vendor. However the manufacturer is in the wrong for selling a product that doesn't perform properly."
856,I have tried this on multiple bodies and lenses.  My Canon's flat out will not AF with this on.  It'll lock but the images are way out of focus.  Remove the CPL and it's fine.  Cannot recommend this CPL at all.
857,"This is one product that falls into the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; category.  It is cheap and does not wear well.  Besides that, it arrived slightly damaged in the box which didn't add to the overall impression.  The edges wear very quickly and come apart."
858,The ring is too thick to fit underneath the clips. Junk. Do not buy this set of replacement pads. Will have to order the originals now.
859,"Don't get this router. I bought this in June 2013 and have had nothing but problems. It works for a few days and then starts dropping connections and closing ports. NAT always flip flops too...such a pain. I've had 5 different routers over the past 10 years, each one better than before, and I've had more problems with this router in the past few months than with all others combined...it's ridiculous. Save your money and get a cheap gaming router."
860,"I loved my Wacom Bamboo Stylus Solo, but the design for the Duo is bad.  First, the stylus tip on the Duo doesn't screw off like the Solo (not sure if that was by design or if mine was defective.)  So you have to screw in the brass nib tip after installing the nib; as you can imagine, it's impossible to keep it tight because the nib is rotating on the nib tip as you try to tighten it.  After coming out several times over the course of a month, I recently lost mine again and this time I couldn't locate it.  Also, the cap for the pen is too loose, so it comes off as well - again, lost several times over the past month.  Worthless design - don't waste your money.  I had to go back to my Solo because it's still functional, unlike the Duo."
861,"We have an ipad 3 and 4. We don't have an ipad 2. I see that many of the reviews says that this works well for their ipad 2. While it may be a good case for the ipad 2, it is not a good case for the ipad 3 or 4. It's hard to get a 3 or 4 in the case and very easy for an ipad 3 or 4 to pop out.My wife gave up just trying to get it on our ipad 3. I wasn't really better, but I stuck with it and got it on our ipad 4 after a few minutes of haranguing. But then twice that night it popped out. Once while opening it and once just rearranging it on our bed. When it popped out a third time the next morning, we went back to our old case. Really worse than it popping out was how aggravating it was to get it back in. My guess is that since the 2 is slightly skinnier than the 3 and 4 that it just fits the 2 better.The swivel isn't bad. The material isn't horrible, but smells a little plasticy. It's a little thick but seems pretty to have a lot of good padding. I prefer a snap shut, but our current snap shut doesn't have swivel and my wife wanted swivel.It might be a good ipad 2 case, but I can't suggest it for the ipad 3 or 4."
862,"I wished I had read the reviews. I loved the idea of having these beautiful headphones however I am extremely disappointed by the dropped signals; the music skipped all the time and the horrible battery life; no more than 3 hours when fully charged; so forget about a long plane trip; you will have to finish the trip with your earbuds. There is no support; I emailed Parrot, got a confirmation that they got the request for support and I never got an answer. I wasted $399 and I am quite pissed at the zero support on this product.Update 11/07/2012: got the parrot back from service with a note that they made sure that v1.02 firmware was installed. By the way, it was when I sent it. They could not find anything wrong with it when tested. I tested it: Same exact issue with music skipping. Same songs dont skip like an old record when you plug them to your iPad or iPhone. It skips only with Bluetooth on. I am still confirming that this is an issue with these Bluetooth headphones and I am not the only one having it. Furthermore, having bought these through Company A at Brookstone,  I am being offered only a Brookstone gift card in case of return. I would think that Parrot should acknowledge the issue and replace these if they feel it is not all headphones affected. Now if it is a firmware issue, they should inform us n when they will come out with a technical solution. Battery life by the way is still awful. 4 hours is unacceptable as these are  targeted for travelers who don't want to hear sound in a plane on long flights. I did send an email to Parrot letting them know that the problem was still persisting. No answer. I guess answering emails is also not part of their DNA"
863,"Unfortunately, I had already thrown away the packaging prior to my taking it on the road.Had to buy a replacement and threw away $45..."
864,Battery life was not ever very good with this battery but it basically died after a few months refusing to take any charge and the laptop would shut down the second it was unplugged.  Don't waste your time or money...
865,"Where is this usb2/firewire 800 adapter to be found.  Even on the Seagate web site they refer to this adapter as available separately but I have been unable to locate it.  The adapters I have been able to locate so far do not look anything like the photo in their ad.  So where is this elusive ""Unique adapter lets you quickly upgrade or change the drive's interface"" shown in the ad.  I have no idea if the drive works or not, I'm still looking for this adapter.Update: After considerable research it appears that you must take the back off of the drive unit and then order the $60 ""Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk Desktop Adapter - Firewire 800/USB 2.0 STAE105"" to use a Firewire connection. I believe Seagate could be more informative regarding this item and at least include instructions with the drive.  Otherwise it's just another basic drive."
866,"Camera keeps telling me it is not a compatible lens. It will not focus correctly, lighting issues. It freezes the camera with low light settings. Not impressed and it was more expensive than the camera."
867,"I really wanted to like this case.  Unfortunately, it's very cheaply made and easily destroyable.  Although the cover ""feels"" nice, the plastic casing that holds the Kindle is glued precariously to the cover, making it very easy to pull apart.  The ilght itself was actually bent and kept sticking, making it difficult to pop it out for use.  Once I did get it out, the light distribution was HORRIBLE.  It lights the top part of the screen and then funnels downward, leaving a strip of light going town the middle of the screen while the sides are in shadow.  Very odd and mostly useless.Don't waste your money buying this.  I returned it immediately.  Instead, if you want a cheaper alternative, by the Company A made lighted case from Company A Warehouse Deals.  You can currently get one in ""Like New"" condition for about $35 bucks."
868,"Its OK nothing exciting about it.  Not much to say about insurance, I bought it just to make sure the StarTech did not work."
869,"I bought this as reviews stated the reliability was better than Lacie. It had more space, was built better and faster. Transferred all of my data from my old drive to this one as i use an external for all video editing and photo projects. Worked great so I wiped my old one clean. Was going to backup the drive today and all of the sudden it would not mount. It powers on, but will not mount to my iMac or Macbook. Its just not there. So now returning it and going to Lacie. What a disappointment."
870,"i just got the product a few minutes ago (prompt delivery), but the slot where you insert the micro sd card looks damaged already from the first look.  it looks as if someone already have this item, messed up the slot and returned it.  this is one thing i hate about ordering online, you will never know what you going to get until you open the product.  it suppose to be new."

873,I had bought these because I had bought a new Tivo an didn't want to run an Ethernet cable through the attic and didn't want to pay the 90+ dollars for the wifi key from Tivo. It appeared to work well at first but then I noticed errors in on both Tivo boxes and when they were linked there were freeze ups and non sufficient bandwidth messages often. I removed the Actiontec product and ran an Ethernet cable and all problems were solved. If you don't require much bandwidth and are not running this product for a Tivo internet connection then they may work well. Otherwise you would be avoiding a lot of trouble looking elsewhere.
874,"Apparently the claims of Skytex's lousy quality control are true.  My Skypad Alpha2 arrived with a dead pixel in the middle of the screen.  Since I had already charged it, I decided to check the features and performance before returning it.  WiFi on this thing is horrendous.  I could only max out the signal bars when standing next to my router (which is a high poweredPremiertek POWERLINK Boost N Wireless Router - IEEE 802.11n).  A mere ten feet away and it started losing bars.  Documentation is minimal and unless you're a tech geek you'll spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to make things work.  It took me two days to figure out how to get an ebook on the thing and another day to figure out how to get an ereader working.  Another day to figure out how to resize text and change between night & day settings.  Also, this thing is heavy.  Too heavy to be used for any amount of time.  If you're going to use it as an ereader, good luck.  Your arm will get tired before your eyes will.  I doubt I'll be replacing the defective unit I got with another one."
875,"I first tried to use the enclosed CD to install this router.  Having no success, I called customer support.  After spending at least 45 minutes trying different things we could not get this router to function properly.  The router was producing a WiFi signal but I could not get signed on.  When I tried to sign on a box requesting the password came up.  When I attempted to put in my password, only numbers would appear.  If I tried to type letters or symbols (upper case numbers) the cursor would just flash.  The tech rep thought it was a computer problem so opened a Word document to test the keyboard and it functioned properly. It's a brand new computer.The rep said she had never encountered that kind of a problem before and had no answer.  That left me with no choice but to return it.A comment about the tech rep I talked to.  I'm sure she know what she was doing but her English was so bad that much of the time on the phone with her was spent asking her to repeat what she said because I could not understand her.  l would usually catch one or two words of what she said and then ask her if that was what she meant."
876,"This router cannot be setup as access point.My wireless adapter is disabled. With ethernet cable I connect my computer into LAN 1 of the router. I check my IP is 192.168.0.100 given by the DHCP server and default gateway is 192.168.0.1. This is good. I open up IE and enter 192.168.0.1. IE says ""cannot display the page"", 404 error. I try again with address: tplinklogin.net but IE reports the same thing, cannot display the page. The manual says about proxy server. I don't have proxy server. I run the installation CD but it fails on step ""Check network status"".I have Netgear and Linksys routers that have been successfully setup as access points. This device cannot be setup as access point. Verizon Fios has its own modem and router in one machine so I can't have another router."
877,Went through 3 protectors trying to install. The tab used to hold the protector cannot be removed without leaving glue residue behind which cannot be cleaned off. Not sure if I will go through the expense of trying to return it. At least it was inexpensive.
878,"When I ordered these, they came very late. Actually i didn't receive them at all but the seller was kind enough to send me again. After such a long wait I finally got them but.....I have had tried screen protector on my phones before but this one was very difficult to install. I wasted two of them while trying to put them on. I never had any luck with the bubbles and dust. The last one which I have now has some bubbles and it looks bad. I wish there was a easy way to put them on the phone. The one I have on looks like the screen is dirty.  Bubbles are really small and very difficult to remove. I followed the instructions very well.Also they are thick so you can see that there is a screen protector on the screen. I was looking for something which is very thin and still protect good. Even in the pictures they leave a bubbles on the side, which look cheap. Also, KEEP IN MIND THEY ARE NOT ANTI-GLARE AT ALL. Its worst then the screen itself.update: Changing the rating to one star. So the last screen protector which I successfully applied with some small bubbles has started to look very horrible now. It has scratch marks all over it and looks very very bad. I keep the phone in same places now where i used to put with no screen protector. Never had any scratch or anything. How can a screen protector has so many scratches? I don't get it. What a waste of my 7 dollars.....never buying anything from them. I will post a pic as soon as I get another camera.."
879,"Update (4/9/13):----------------I decreased my inital rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. I was satisfied initially as the blocker was working and I enjoyed it automatically hanging up on saved calls.  But today, I noticed the blocker interfereing with my DSL connection. The indicator on my router/dsl modem showed not working when the device was into a phone line.  As soon as I removed the device, the indication was all good.I'm not sure why the problem wasn't showing up when I first both it.  But the bottom line is now with my DSL service, I really can't use this device and I', back to having to call screen on my answering machine all the marketing calls.Original Review Follows:------------------------One and Done, Not Perfect - But Better Than Nothing---------------------------------------------------After reading the various reviews, I think how effective the Call Blocker works is hit or miss depending on how the phone provider sends the caller id signal to the line.  For me, the Call Blocker helps, but isn't a complete solution.I think a complete solution would suppress (no ring) calls that are blacklisted, yet allow caller ID information to pass through for regular, non-blacklisted calls.For my particular phone set up, I have a digital answering machine and one caller ID phone.  I tried connecting the Call Blocker in series (Call Blocker to line, then to answering machine which connects to phone) but by doing so, some calls not on my blacklist coming in did not show up on my caller ID, but only showed ""Calling"".  I then connected in parallel (use of splitter).  With in parallel connection, all caller ID information shows up, but for callers on my ""Blacklist"", the phone rings once before the Call Blocker hangs up on the call.  I would have preferred first ring suppression, but at least hang up after one ring is still better than nothing.Pros:----- device does help control telemarketing calls- blacklist holds a generous 1500 amount of calls- no batteries requiredCons:----- for me, in series connection may not show caller id for regular callers; in parallel connection allows one ring even on blacklisted numbers- device only stores numbers, not names even if you have caller id and name service- descriptions misleading: unlike picture, no backlighting; box says 5 LCD contrast levels when there are only 4- similar buttons can be confusing.  Blackist button same shape and next to Remove button (I used a black marker to put a dot on the blacklist button for better identification)Overall, the Call Blocker device does help control telemarketing calls. I'd prefer no ring with blacklisted calls, but the one ring then hang up is acceptable.I figure, with 1500 numbers available to store on my blacklist, if I average having to block about 4 telemarketing calls a day, the memory won't get full until about a year.  By that time, maybe the telemarketers will have moved on and I'll erase the blacklist and start over.In the meantime, with each ""one ring then hang up"", I'll smile and say ""Zap!  Another telemarketing call bites the dust!""Update (03/15/2013):  Saved by Non-Volatile Memory--------------------------------------------------I came home today and took off my coat then went to check the caller ID on this device.  When I pressed on an arrow...Zap!!..a static charge reset the device.  The device turned totally blank and required unplugging of the line chord and plugging back in to restart.  Then, I noticed the Year and Day/Time was reset so I had to re-enter.  But luckily, all the telemarketing calls which I stored are still all there.  Thanks to the non-volatile memory none of these numbers disappeared."
880,"Update 10/17/13: I said in another review that I thought saying ""I hate it"" sounds so immature...but I have to retract that statement when it's regarding this laptop.  I really do hate it and I wish I had realized the problems were not mine and returned it while I could.  It took me months to save enough $ to buy a laptop. which of course makes my remorse worse. I can't even begin to describe all the issues this laptop has, but I will tell you about the worst problem. It's the cursor, it jumps all around the place without your help, it jumps and starts typing over what you have already typed.  It usually takes me 3-4 tries to even send an email, there have been MANY times I have had to start over or redo whatever I am doing even more than 3-4 attempts. When that happens I usually just stop trying and turn it off.  I can't really even begin to express my frustration fully. After I realized that this problem was not ""user error"" I decided to go back and re-read the reviews only to discover that the reviews are CLEARLY full of bad reviews about this very issue. I wish I could go back and read more than a couple of reviews!  I am not even telling you in detail about this issue...that's funny because the reason I am not going to give more detail is because I, not surprisingly, have had to re-type this 3 times already and I am getting a headache.  In closing, carefully read the negative reviews, others have explained this in much more detail than I. BUYER BEWARE!"
881,"I received this router from Company A, and I am unable to connect to it or configure it.I've connected the router to the power outlet, then plugged in my MacBook via ethernet into one of the 4 Gigabit ports, and was expecting my MacBook to be issued an IP address via DHCP. However, the MacBook never got an Ip address, and settled on self-routed 169... address. The power light is very slowly flashing. The ethernet light is on when plugged in. When manually setting MacBook's IP to 192.168.1.2, I am able to ping the router at 192.168.1.1, but the web GUI won't load, just hangs forever. Exchanging this particular router for another (same model), hoping this was just a fluke.  Will update this review when I get the replacement model, but so far first impression is not great."
882,"This is the second one of these I bought.  The first lasted 2 hours, this one 15 minutes and died."
883,"Tried these out on several occasions, I am not an owner. However I found my Sennheisers to deliver a much more balanced and rich sound at less then half the price. I didn't wear the Beats long enough to determine comfort but they did seem a bit on the stiffer side though well padded.Beats seem like a overrated branding popularized by heavy marketing yet delivering sub par sound when compared to equally priced headphones like Audio Technica's (which I love), Denon, Senn's and others.There's a good Youtube review I found that seems to agree with this: /watch?v=et_PWifUd1w&feature;=relatedIf you're looking for sound, this ain't it, if you wanna look like a toll..."
884,"Yes they sound good, but not for the price.I have many headphones and these are average in sound quality.  They do look cool, but I don't care about that when listening to music.  The highs and mids seem reduced so that you have to turn them up which makes the bass even more louder not better.  The bass does boom but does not recover as quickly as some other brands I have tried.  Now I may have had to high of exceptations for these since so many reviews talked about how great they sounded and how much better they were than the other headphones the reviewers used.  You can buy a pair for almost half the price with a better sound; they just won't look as cool.  Even the Sony over the ear headphones These do not bottom out though, even when the bass is really hard and loud.  Then again, may good quality headphones do not bottom out on really strong bass.  The problem is that though these have good tweeters they are filtered more so that the bass is more dramatic.  IF YOU ARE WANTING JUST BASS THEN BUY THESE.  If you are looking for sound as the recording studio heard it then buy some other pair of headphones that are not worried about name and looks.These beats are not comfortable at all.  The ear foam is too hard and they make my ears hurt after about 15mins."
885,"Pushased after seaing so many advertisment that you can monitor your self. You need professional installation, you need to pay BIG monthly fee to a monitoring company to control from Iphone etc. Each feature come with a price. Very good product Bad way to market."
886,Defective. Also tried to upgrade firmware to no avail.  Do Not Buy! I should have read the other reviews first...so sad...
887,"I don't know it is hit or miss. So far, I ordered and tried 2 ArmorSuit products, one for Surface 8 pro, one for Surface RT. Both were waste of money and time. Side pieces are mis-sized(too wide) so I had to try to carve out the excess pieces which didn't work very well of course and ended up threw away. Screen protector's hole on the top was cut too high, so after I aligned the hole, the bottom stuck out way lower than the device, therefore top part of device is not entirely covered. So I had to take it off and tried to cut the bottom pieces just to use it. Of course it was cut uneven and after 3rd trial of the screen protector's cutting and modifying, tiny specs and dust got in.If I knew the sizes were all wrong, I would have cut them all before I took it off and spray it. That would have been worked better. But of course I expected them to be the right size.Total waste of money and time. Since I had to cut, modify, etc. I can't even return this item any more either."
888,"What a piece of JUNK!  After ONE backup, this drive died - is not recognized by computer, cannot access, lost all files, photos, etc. UNBELIEVABLE!  I just wish I could get my info OFF of it before sending back. It is unsettling to know that I have to return a drive with personal info on it that the incompetent company that built the worthless unit can access. This is so unacceptable. DO NOT BUY!"
889,I bought this for my little brother as soon as he got his iphone 4s and it failed when he dropped his phone from about 4 feet. Now his screen is nothing but vertical lines.
890,"Last year my girlfriend got a Kindle Fire and to protect her tablet I bought her a RooCase. Its been a year and the case is holding up great. This year I got a Nexus 7 and of course I went with roocase. There are cheaper cases out there but I wanted the best quality for my money and I really liked the kindle version.When my nexus roocase arrived I was disappointed to find out that the sleep and awake feature doesn't work. I don't have a screen protector and I'm running the stock OS. I restarted my device several times to see if that would fix it, but to no avail. Then I noticed if you the case is closed just the right way it will work. However its not consistent and not a feature I would trust. So naturally I'm returning it which is a shame. I had high hopes for this case."
891,"I bought this case when I bought my Google Nexus 7 2013 thinking it would be perfect. Well first off, they say a pen comes in it, however it is implied that it is a stylus you can use to draw on your tablet; well its not, it's just a cheap pen that is tiny. When I put the tablet in the case and close it and bring it somewhere with me, when I try to use the tablet once I reach my destination, the battery has depreciated because the tablet kept turning on and off in the case. AND because of this occuring, my tablet enters this weird state that only occurs when using this case. My advice, buy a better case with the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield."
892,The screen is defective. It records a screen touch when there is none. The info bar constantly opensbecause it thinks there's a touch in that area in the lower right corner. Very frustrating. Will have to return.
893,"I was looking forward to getting an inexpensive off-brand tablet that came rooted and appeared to be comparable(hardware wise -cpu/processor & ram)to the more expensive brand-name tablets. It worked fine for about a week then the touchscreen started becoming unresponsive occasionally, which was usually fixed with a reboot. The touchscreen became totally unresponsive after about 2 weeks. After trying to reset/reinstall the firmware unsuccessfully, I concluded that it is a hardware issue. It is a cheap off-brand implementation of a tablet, I don't recommend buying this one. Other reviewers have noted this same issue on similar tablets so it's probably a good idea to check them out before buying."
894,"The cradle comes with a 800mA power block and it is apparently unknown whether it is acceptable to use it with the Asus 2A (2,000mA) power block (the one that comes with your Nexus 7). I tried to ask, but Company A immediately apologized and dropped out an RMA and a refund.While other buyers have mentioned using the Asus power block in place of the included one, many other buyers have talked about the cradle unit dying after using it for a while. Putting 2+2 together, I think some buyers have been swapping out the power blocks and this may be destroying the cradles.Without swapping the power blocks, expect charging to either be constant or to take more time than you use the tablet. After 8 hours on charge, the tablet went from 15% to 40% in my experience. The supplied 800mA charger is effectively as efficient as charging from a USB port on your computer."
895,"I love this cover. It completely covers the iPad front and back and provides good protection while being very thin and minimalist. It looks fantastic on the iPad and I get lots of complements on it. There are supposedly a few ways to fold the cover, but I really only use one. The sleep function works perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because once it's on, it's on. If there's a way to take it off I haven't figured it out. You really need to press the corners to get it to snap on, and then it holds the iPad very securely. But make sure you clean off the back of the iPad and are happy with how it looks because once the cover snaps on you're stuck with it. I saw anther review where someone did take the cover off, but it broke in the process and couldn't be used anymore. It does feel like a determined effort to remove it is going to damage it so I've left it on.Update April 2013I've had my case for about 5 months now, and the case has developed cracks on all of the corners, and chips of the case have come off on the corners. I've never dropped the iPad and I even put it inside a sturdy but soft envelope case when carrying it inside a briefcase or tote to further protect it, so the case has not had any rough handling at all. I see that other people are now reporting the same problem. I will be getting a new case, but will not buy this brand again. Unfortunate, it's a beautiful and very functional case, but not durable enough, especially for the price."
896,"Well not too sure how good this TV would be since I received it with a busted screen. TCL will not cover a broken screen either, and obviously Company A didn't have anymore due to it being a black Friday deal. I guess TCL shouldn't be held liable for something that could of happen in the shipping to me, however who's to say it didn't happen in the factory. It came in the factory retail box as well with no dents or anything so I question if it was a handling issue. The retail box wasn't very well protected either inside. I also got a 60&#34; vizio out the same truck with no issues at all."
897,"I have always use Linksys routers and far as I can remember but this has to be the worst and most expensive router I have ever own! I must say, the &#34;bells and whistles&#34; really caught my attention! I bought this to replace my E1200 Linksys router (no Gigabit ports)! I don&#8217;t think that this model should have been released until fully tested. Even with the firmware updates, it was still buggy! The user interface is horrible and every change you make it takes forever to save changes! I keep getting drop signals and settings going back to default! I sent this router right back after a couple of days! I would not recommend this expensive product!"
898,Cannot rate this item. Had to cancel both times because the items I purchased were defective and had to be returned.
899,I could never get the program to let me get logged in. Kept getting error messages.  I'm just writing this one off.
900,"Hi:I like handstrap cases and already had the Poetic Slimline case for the Nexus 7 2013. I was prepared to like it but the clips that hold the tablet are so tight that the unlock screen won't work. I slide down with my finger and it just flashes and returns to the lock screen. I tried pulling at the clips to see if they would loosen up but the behavior persists.The clips are so tight that it takes five minutes of pulling and expanding to get the tablet out of the case. There are reports of users pulling the back off the tablet using cases like this. It's a poster child of bad and dangerous design. Back it goes.I've certainly been disappointed in the features of different cases but this is the first I would characterize as dangerous.Caveat Emptor,Tom"

I started googling Drobo problems and found that many of these get stuck in a Power Cycle issue. I realized that was what mine was doing after a few minutes.

910,I purchased this item last year but I didn't set it up until recently as I bought it as a back up for VCR/ dvd player/ recorder I already had.I had it set up for about 2 weeks and it started eating tapes.It came with no instruction manual so I had to figure it out for myself.When I purchased it it didn't say it was a refurbished magnavox. I my opinion magnavox has the worse products available.I would never have purchased it had I known the manufacturer.The supplier is out of the US so dealing with them is very difficult.They told me to call Magnavox and Magnavox has no record of this machine and no customer service. So buy this at your own risk.DONT BUY THIS MACHINE.I WOULD RATE IT A 0 NOT 1.

912,"A 27"" monitor at about $250 with HDMI input seemed an excellent deal. However...1) I did not realize this cannot be attached to a dual monitor stand. I was planning to use 2 monitors at the same time (my old 23"" and this new 27"") but now have simply replaced my smaller monitor with a bigger one2) The resolution of this screen is 1920 x 1080. While it sounds a lot, it is exactly the same as my old 23"".- I use my computer for programming, so screen real estate is very important.- This new monitor simply shows me the same stuff my old monitor did but with bigger pixels- I can have my applications show smaller fonts, have my Linux operating system show smaller icons, but it is not an optimum solutionSo I end up moving my head more (side to side and up & down) to look at what I used to see much more easily on my 23"" monitor :(3) Sound is terrible (not a big issue for me or anyone else who would use external speakers), simply wonder why they bother to put in speakers.So, this monitor looks good on paper but is pretty disappointing in real life. I would have returned it, but had already thrown away the box :((If I had my druthers, I would have bought the ASUS PB278Q 27-Inch WQHD LED-lit PLS Professional Graphics Monitor (http://www.Company A.com/gp/product/B009C3M7H0).

913,"Bad product. Does not interface with the phone as promised.  Sound quality substandard.  Overpriced for the quality.Not sure what else to say other than that.  It was an exercise in frustration.  Not only is the sound quality substandard, but the headset itself is cheap and easily broken.Not a fan."
914,"Owned this a year now.Price is right but it is just a pain, it literally has to 'boot up' and if you want to use a programmable remote the set does not let you just select an input directly, you have to cycle through them, which just does not work well with macro programmed remotes, especially with the boot up.  Otherwise its somewhat ok, I don't find the picture to be that sharp for an HD.  I would not purchase this again.  I did strictly on price and have buyers remorse."
915,"Bought this as a gift and now after about 1 1/2 months of very light use, the &#34;J&#34; does not work.  I would not recommend this product."

920,"Life Proof Case, The marketing for this case was great but this case has a few engineering drawbacks.The case is fully protected from sand, water and dust. This level of protection limits some iPad features.  The speakers are muffled for a low quality audio experience, and the microphone will not pick up your voice for dictation.To use the dictation feature on iPad headphones are required.  The headphone terminal is protected by a screw down plug with gasket.  Once that is removed, screw in the additional audio connector.  There is no where on the case to store this while not in use.  So be sure to not loose it.  Replacements are available on the Life Proof website and cost $19.99.The cover (an additional $40) and stand are flimsy and low-quality material.  There is no where to store the cover while it is not being used.Lastly, when you attempt to return your case to Life Proof they require it to be in the original packaging along with a 15% restock fee.The OtterBox defender series comes with a durable and easy to use cover with stand.  When not in use, the cover attaches to the back of the case for extra protection.  The case is very durable and stylish at the same time.  The case has a screen protector and all features of the iPad are fully protected, but easily accessible.  I highly recommend this case, Because the cost truly meets the value of case.When comparing the two cases the better value is the Otter Box Defender which is $70 less than the Life Proof case(w/cover).I reviewed 3 cases before selecting the Otterbox.I tested functionality, and my 2 year old son tested durability.Those cases were:Griffin Survivor Extreme Duty- my 2 year old removed the rubber portion of the case cover within 20 minutes.Life Proof: full review above.Otterbox: it survived my 2 year old using it daily for 2 weeks.My selection was based on durability (it survived my 2 year old using it daily for 2 weeks), usability (doesnt restrict iPad features), and price."

922,I ordered the H2258 in March but stuck the box in a closet when it arrived. I just opened it today. I don't know what I received but it wasn't the product pictured. There is no rotating clamp with the unit. I have a the telescoping rod and a  cheesy piece of plastic that fits over the top of a light stand. The plastic is at the very end of the rod. There is no way to counterbalance the weight of a reflector with this thing. This thing can barely hold its own weight. I think I learned a lesson.
923,"This card was expensive, first time I took a wedding, I uploaded it to my computer, as I always do when I get back from a wedding (of which you cannot go back and redo - no matter how  much you would like to sometimes -It downloaded, and as soon as I went back to the Compact Flash UDMA 7 64Gb a horrible sinking feeling came over me when I saw that the first 188 photos were GONE! In their place was a manilla colored file folder with either chinese or japanese hyroglyphics under each file.  Fortunately the first upload was successful, and I did not lose all of the photos, but, the next time (I took a chance) and took more photos as a newspaper editor has to jump and take photos in a moments' notice.  I realized I had not taken out the compact flash memory card, and had to hope that I could get the pictures.  Again I let the computer automatically upload them, then went to check them and try and to organize into my computer the files I needed for the weekly newspaper.  To my dismay, the same thing had happened, and the warning kept coming up saying to put the card through a format.  I tried to upload what I could salvage, did the format, but, now the warning comes up that the flash disc says it is not successful and cannot format some of the &#34;empty Japanese writing files&#34;!  For a professional card, and for the money it cost, I feel I am out a cost that I may not be able to get back.  I would not recommend this product to anyone, and will go to another brand and not the professional 800X &#34;Lexar&#34;.  I would like to be able to use the flash disc, though, as I paid good money for it.  How can I completely wipe off these troublesome files!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????  A Concerned newspaper editor in Summit County, Utah, and I would not recommend this to purchase nor would I purchase it again!Cheryl  ; or  "
924,"OK.  I just unpacked this modifier and am not at all happy.This softbox was very appealing: the grid, two diffusions, the flash bracket, great price.I had high hopes that the manufacturers would have been reading the comments posted by Company A customers and would have made requisite corrections.Let me tell you that just hasn't happened.As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with instructions.(1) The speed ring has twelve possible receptacles for the four rods which shape the box.I get that each pair are supposed to be opposite to each other.  However I was not willing to risk ripping the vinyl that the box is made from and being unable to return the thing.A little direction here would not have cost the manufacturer much.(2) The four rods are supposed to fit in sleeve-sockets at the open end of the modifier.Three of the sleeve sockets were in place; the fourth was missing/stitched over.(3) The ring of the flash bracket is NOT the one depicted in the photographs used in the Company A advertising.(4) The notches on the flash bracket ring do not in any way align with any part of the Bowens-style speedring.Even if I was to waste more time trying to puzzle out which four holes to use in the speedring, I still wouldn't be able to mount the flash bracket to the speedring.My time (and yours) is worth more than the aggravation and time lost buying this carelessly manufactured, carelessly packaged product.I will contact Company A about returning this nightmare.  If something changes, I will update this review.>>>>Update:I called Company A who gave me the seller's telephone number.Richard answered the phone and was very helpful:1) Regarding the rods on the speedring:  You need to use the two which are closest together (on each opposing side).2) The missing ""rod pocket"" is designed that way. That is the last rod which goes in to place and uses the velcro from the outside of the package to close over.3) Richard acknowledged that they had put the wrong bracket in the package and is sending a new one by priority mail.4) There was a bit of hemming and hawing about why there were no instructions in the box - nothing satisfactory though.IF the bracket shows up in time for me to use on an upcoming shoot, I will keep this soft box.  Otherwise...As has been mentioned elsewhere, this is NOT what you want for location work: it takes too dang long to set up.I think there is also a safety risk inherent in this design: the rods are under a lot of tension.  One mistake and someone could easily damage an eye during assembly."
925,"I bought this for my wife, it was ordered March 11, 2014 and I finally got it April 10, 2014 only to discover it is defective.There is some kind of short in the unit as it connects and disconnects and is totally unstable and useless.I live in the Caribbean and it is cost prohibitive to return this item."
926,"Well I used Consumer Preview all of last summer loved it!! No bluescreens what so ever, internet worked fine everything was perfect.  Then I get the OEM 64-Bit builder disc and that ruined my computer.As soon as I installed it I knew I shouldn't have.  In the corner I had a Build Number stuck there, downloaded updates those failed to install.  After two hours of clean installs I finally got it somewhat stable.Then a ton of bluescreens, my antivirous wasn't compatible even though they said so on their website.  So a new antivirous and I was good to go.A week later same issues random bluescreens ect. Downloaded more motherboard bios, gpu drives everything.  Went through a good two more hours to reach the same conclusion.This has went on for three months, so today I'm installing Windows 7 Ultimate and destroying Windows 8.  I loved the tiles, ease of access to comand prompt ay nd system but the unstability killed it.  It's not just because it's a custom build either, I have two friends who bought seperate laptops one is an HP Envy and another is a gateway both with windows 8.  They both experience connection problems, random bluescreens, ect. So looks like Windows 8 is toss up.So flip a coin and buy this.July 15th, 2013 UpdateI had a bad memory stick that's what was causing all of my bluescreens (or most), and I had motherboard bios issues. But what I said still holds true, my internets whacky on the desktop, however my laptop and everything will connect to Wi-Fi. Even tablets running windows 8 I'm cautious about, I've seen a variety of them have bluescreens."
927,This thing does no line out to tv so its useless. If this requires software or something else you should place it on the purchase page to have in mind before buying. Its on  a drawer right now.  :(

Very disappointed in Apple for this one.  8 gigs was not quite enough on her 4th generation iPod which quite working so she decided a 16 would be a good step up and didn't realize the thing with the camera.  Essentially, Apple is forcing you to spend the big bucks and jump up to the 32 gig."

931,"I just finished successfully putting a similar screen protector on my iphone, so I expected that with some care, I would be able to get this on. Both protectors I received were impossible to apply to my Kindle without leaving bubbles - not just a few bubbles here and there or even quite a few bubbles - there are so many bubbles on my Kindle, the poor think looks like it's broken out in bubble hives. The enclosed card that you use to work out the bubbles helped work out some of the bubbles, and even so, it looks horrible. I'm honestly not sure what I could have done to make this go on better. I can't recommend this product."
932,I got those but the Batt drains in hours I had to buy the original Nikon as this one was not worth any use when you are doing professional photography and are been paid by some one. I would not buy it again.
933,"I bought this adapter along with D-link DIR-865L AC1750 router to be able to transfer large files fast over the wireless connection. Installation of both the router and this adapter took no more than 10 minutes, and I was happy to see 585Mbps connection between my Windows 8 desktop and the router... until I tried to copy a 2GB file from my desktop to my NAS drive. The transfer speed was just 11MBps (approximately 88mbps), just a little bit faster than my old N300 router could handle... and that's not even the worst part of the story. During the transfer, my desktop lost wireless connection. I opened device manager and couldn't find wireless adapter under network controllers at all. It simply disappeared. I removed it from the USB port and put it back - nothing. Put it into another USB port - nothing. Both USB ports on the front of my desktop just stopped working. My desktop couldn't recognize any device connected to them. I turned off my desktop, removed power cord from the wall outlet, and, after a few minutes, turned on the desktop. This time, thanks God, both USB ports worked just fine. From my experience, such kind of things happens when some device, connected to USB port, requires more power than the USB port can supply. Long story short, I tried 16 different USB ports on 2 desktops and 1 laptop (let me say, modern desktops and laptop with both USB2 and USB3 ports) and found a few ports which could handle this adapter's power requirements while transferring large files better than others. Even now, most of the time, I wasn't able to transfer any files larger than 3-4GB. I think this adapter has a major design flaw which could probably be fixed by firmware or driver update... but let's see what's the latest driver's date on D-link website. It's dated 10/29/2012, and it's major advantage, according to D-link - ""Supports Windows Vista"". It doesn't even officially supports Windows 8 (but in fact works with it, I must say). Six months without any updates... Well, I better return this thing to Company A and buy adapter from another brand."

935,"Got it for the wife for christmas. She loved it then 60 days random things stopped working like the wifi, bluetooth, keyboard.Their customer support made us check a bunch of things before they would even let us send it in for warranty and you have to pay shipping.  No biggie sent it into Asus. 45 days later  it comes back and its in worse shape. Touchscreen does not work. It does not even boot up right. wheres the quality control? Did some research on BBB turns out they have a reputation and alert since 2012 of bad repairs. They refuse to replace or refund the money so I have a $1300 paperweight.Its probably ok if you get one that works but if not prepare for the worst if you have to send it in. buyer beware."

938,"Received this product yesterday and thought I would see how much was going to be involved in setting it up, so I opened the box. Honestly, my first impression is this is one serious IP camera...WAY more serious than the Foscam one I already have. The more I unpacked, however, the more distressed I became as there is no installation manual and no CD with installation software. Right on the box it says """"User manual and software CD"" included. Nope - not there.So I go to the q-see web site...and it's next to impossible to find the product since they're all organized by ""Platinum Series"", ""Premium Series"", etc., and the ""series"" of my camera is not stated anywhere on the box. So I find the model number on the camera itself and do a search, and after wading through numerous pages, I find the sales page for this product. However, there are no manuals to be found...so it would appear I'm going to have to make a call to the people at q-see to figure out how to install this thing. I'd certainly expect better than this for a product that sells for close to $350.UPDATE. After almost an hour, I found the user manual for this product buried many layers deep on the q-see web site. Had to go to the Site Map to even get close. Now I have to decide if I want to print the 96 page manual...then I have to find the software that also wasn't included in the box. I'm already not enjoying the installation experience, and I haven't even come close to hooking it up (which, based on my experience with the Foscam product, will probably not be fun)."
939,"I was attempting to hook my MacBook Pro into my Xbox One's TV HDMI.  It was successful!  Once!  After removing it one time and attempting to move it to a different source, the HDMI cord just simply fell apart.  Avoid this at all cost and get a higher quality one."
940,"I was originally quite satisfied with this purchase, even to the point of foregoing my typical habit of observing a product in use for a while before reviewing it. After a couple of hours of seeing it drawing on a tablet, it appeared to be exactly what was needed other than a little residue on the screen.This a very nice stylus out of the box, sized appropriately for young hands or those with dexterity challenges. For a toddler (and I would say anyone up to a preschool aged child) there is one fatal flaw. The tip of the device is hollow. Because there is play in the rubberized portion which contacts the screen, friction is created with the underlying metal tip. After a few days of light use, this device now has an exposed metal part and is essentially broken.It is not being returned because it appears to work as it was designed to. Unfortunately it just simply was not up to normal use by a small child who has not mastered the art of ""gentle"". 4 stars reduced to 1 for the fragility of the business end of the device, which should in practice be the most resilient component of the product."

947,"This is a protective case that does not protect!  This case is quite possibly the greatest marketing gimmick of all time!  The case basically does nothing to protect the most vulnerable portion of the device - the screen!  There is literally NOTHING covering or protecting the screen... unbelievable.  It protects the strong aluminum back of the iPad (which needs no protection), but NOT the screen.Marketing genius!Aside from the fact that it takes a LONG time to put the case on, it obviously does not work... How could it work, when it does NOT actually protect the screen?I received one as a present from my wife.  We spent 20 minutes after opening the box, looking for the screen cover, just to realize that it did not have a screen cover!  WHAT, no screen protection?  Not wanting to disappoint my gift-giving wife, I stupidly put the ridiculous thing on my iPad anyway and took it to the beach.  Surprise, surprise, when I removed the case later that afternoon there were SCRATCHES ALL OVER THE SCREEN from sand and sand covered objects that had rubbed against the iPad's screen in the beach bag.

It won't work unless you install their software, the purpose of which is to back up your data on a schedule.  But there's no way of opting out of this, and no way of arranging the hard drive so it works simply through Windows, and not through their software.Also:  if you get the 100 GB size, you'll only have 80 GB left for your data.

I sent the card back for a replacement and it took about a week to come in.  The replacement card does have a Wi-Fi signal; but, it will not accept the default 8 digit Wi-Fi passcode on the iPhone.  I cannot find anything in the card documentation showing a different passcode for 16GB SD card.I like the price and features of this card; but, I can't even get it connected to use them.

I've searched all over the internet and cannot find where or how to change timeout settings without having a Comp Sci degree or paying Cisco to support their own product. I have to power cycle it EVERY DAY, sometimes TWICE.

956,plugged it in yesterday evening worked perfectly had a mouse plugged in it worked well then  i plugged in a keyboard mouse combo it worked i went for dinner restarted after and 24 hours later it is dead. it wont boot past 2 linux penguins then dies. ive asked the seller if there is not a reset method but i doubt it. if i get it working again i will post that if not assume its gone back.when it did work it worked very well!well i opened the case there is a light on the board it gets power from both the micro usb and full usb plug  it is on for 20 30 sec then boom goes the power its dead in less than 24 hours of use i like the idea the chinese construction and lack of standards hurt it carry through.
957,"SCROLL DOWN FOR A STEP BY STEP ON DISASSEMBLING THE UNITTo start, I was really excited to pick this up really cheap from one of those sale-a-day online retailers (I did not purchase it here) and when I got it, it worked right out of the box and sounds pretty good when it's all charged. I was able to run it for six hours straight without the battery dying.Unfortunately, like many other folks who bought this I've stumbled upon the crappy, cheap USB connector which has sunk inside of the unit and can no longer be recharged. This particular USB connector is a SMD (Surface Mount Device) which has no parts that go through the main board to be secured with solder on the other side. These units are typically wave soldered in large batches. Being that it's an SMD, it makes repairing it nearly impossible because, in my case, it ripped up tiny copper traces on the board leaving no real good way to resolder the component.I have taken the unit apart and took a picture of the culprit which can be seen here: [...]I was thinking of sending it out for warranty replacement but this division of Westinghouse Digital seems so shady, from what I've read, that I don't think it's worth it to salvage the $50 I lost on this unit. There are no service centers or online customer support listed on their site. It's safe to say I'll never buy another Westinghouse Digital product again.DISSASSEMBLY:To take the unit apart, take a small flathead screwdriver or a plastic spudger and remove the front grill carefully. It's not glued at all so it should be fairly easy. Then, unscrew the four (4) corner screws and three (3) center screws. Next, take your screwdriver or spudger to the back of the unit and wedge it between the back and the rubbery body. The back should slide out but it is a snug fit so work the corners evenly until you can pull the rest by hand. Once they're separated, remove the small white ribbon cable that goes from the touch buttons and mic to the board, then unscrew the two (2) screws from either side of the board and unscrew the two (2) screws from the battery holder. Now you can slide that whole unit away from the backplate to expose the board and there you'll see the switch, 1/8"" Aux jack and the storied USB connector. Unscrew three (3) more screws on the bottom of the board to remove the battery holder. Good luck!"
958,"I got this to use with the iPad Mini Retina, but it did not work.  I have since been communicating with Hex3 about this issue, but they don't want to give me an RMA.  They insist that it does work.  I am still in communication with them, but the person I am exchanging emails with has been less than helpful.  I read through their ""Terms of Service"" and it says that they do RMA's, but this person said they don't do RMA's  They only 1) Try to Fix it, 2) Replace it if it cannot be fixed.  I strongly advise against getting this stylus.  They only communicate through email and will not give you a phone number to speak with them.  They take advantage of you and will not help one bit.  So far, I was asked to view their Setup Video, which does not go into detail on activating or setting up within the app or the device and/or any details of any issues that may come up.  Then I was asked to read their Getting started PDF (same as what was on back of box) so it was useless.  So far I am not happy with this device or the company HEX3. I will update this post with more as I progress with this customer service rep.****************************UPDATE (Jan 14, 2014):  My last email to them was Jan 9, I had to email them to get a reply from that email.  Their response was to try ""Procreate"". Why should I spend more money to ""TEST"" if the pen works with another software? (PROCREATE) When their website lists apps that work, the two I used are listed, Autodesk SketchbookX and Pro.  We will see what they say.****************************UPDATE (Jan 18, 2014): Received my reply to my question.  They said ""We will not pay you to test Procreate. The stylus works fine with the Apps in  our list, it also works fine on all iPads. Since you are unwilling to test with other Apps, we cannot help you further, but can provide the following info so you can perhaps fix the problem yourself.The problem you see can be caused in the followin ways:1. Using old plastic tips (this is a new items, plastic tips???)2. Some screen protectors (iPad does not have that)3. Some Apps that have not had the new SKD implemented for iPad Air (I have the iPad Mini Retina)4. Problems with some Apps after updates - including the privacy permissions for the microphone and some other problems - remedied by deleting and installing the app again.5. If you use a case that decreases the donductivity between your body and the iPad screen - remedied by removing the case and holding the iPad body as a work around to test.6. Some customers who have unusally dry or calloused hands (such as rock climbers or rowers) have problems with conductivity - remedied by adding conductive paste (below)7. Finally, the conductive paste on the pin part of the tip might have become wiped off or dried out - remedied by adding conductive paste (below).What will fix the problem is a small amount of this carbon electrically conductive grease:http://www.Company A.com/MG-Chemicals-Carbon-Conductive-Grease/dp/B000KQ1CWOORhttp://www.Company A.com/Gardner-Bender-OX-100B-Anti-Oxidant-Compound/dp/B000BODU66/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topApply about 1-2mm to the pin where it enters the stylus, this will fix the issue - note NOT the drawing end of the tip! Wipe off any excess with a tissue or paper towel.**********************************1. This is a new pen and we established they are the teflon tips.2. Established I don't have a screen protector on the iPad Mini.3. They advertise the Apps I am using on their website, current.4. Did that, first thing I did, delete and re-installed.5. The case is causing problems with the pen?????6. Calloused hands?????  Looks like they are grasping at anything to prove their device works....7. Conductive Paste?  What is that?  This is a new product that has never been used before.  How will it dry out or be wiped off? They want me to use Grease!!! What????I tell you, this company is just a con.  They are not going to help me with this problem.  They looking for anything they can come up with to tell me that their pen works and there is nothing wrong with it.  They will not Honor their warranty/guarantee.  I have to say I despise this company and will never buy from them again.  I will post this on every site that sells this pen.Buyer Beware."

960,"I bought one that came without the 9v battery that is supposed to be with it. I don't have a 9v so I can't test it. I wrote te seller and ask for the battery.The magnetic back is a joke, I put it at the top of my refrigerator and it just slid all the way to the floor."
961,"As with other reviews, the folks on the other end heard lots of echo.  I had to return it."
962,"I don't like to give one star reviews, I really don't, and especially Seagate. I have been using their products for over 10 years without a complaint. I actually have two more of their old firewire externals still being used on my desk. But this thing is a complete mess. My iMac won't detect it, (I went through all their troubleshooting tips), and I'm just sitting here confused as to why my computer doesn't see this thing.It reminds me of the old days when I was a PC user and had to install something, switches, codes, etc. I thought this era was over with and devices were pretty much plug-n-play. I'd be wary of this device if I were you, just read the other reviews of this thing. Ugh."
963,"Due to totally unacceptable battery life, I returned it. I also didn't think the keyboard feel was very good. Sorry I cannot recommend it."
964,"read the fine print, this is for UPGRADING a non-usb 3.0 system to 3.0....but if you already have USB 3.0 and want a few 3.0 ports on the front of your computer and a card reader then you are SOL.Do not buy if you already have USB 3.0, it won't work. The manufacturer even says so but why isn't this in BOLD in the item description?Thus, one star. Just spent 4 hours trying to get it to work with ASROCK 970 extreme 3 mobo...no go.Fix this problem and this would be a five star item if only for the fact it is the ONLY usb 3.0 card reader (supporting CF cards, internal connection via PCI) with ports for the front of you computer. strange, isn't it??hope this helps!"
965,I just got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in 2014 version and it does not work with this model had to return it.  The main buttons along the bottom of the screen were covered.
966,"It works, but get only about 100 shots with it compared with close to 300 with an Olympus battery."
967,"This arrived with one of the magnets that attach the cover to the tablet situated with reverse polarity.  Before I realized why the thing would not stay on my tablet, it wiped my hard drive and reuined the display.  Why did I think connecting a magnet to my tablet made sense.  Now I am out of $550 and all my data."
968,"A total waste of time and money. If it wasn't so cheap, I'd return it but for the money I paid for it, it was more fun to put it in the garbage disposal."
969,"The drives can be formatted, but the problem is that even though it shows there are 256gb there are actually less than 8gb and the drives constantly disconnect. I bought 4 of them. All 4 are garbage with both my PC and my MAC. Company A needs to ban this seller immediately."
970,"I have had Yamaha AV receivers for 20+ years and only replace them to keep up with technology. I purchased the re-branded RX-V675 at Costco to coincide with a new TV purchase. Fortunately, my router is directly behind my entertainment center cabinet, so I had the Yamaha hard-wired thru a hole in the wall. While listening to my Pandora One account the next several days, I began having intermittent ""Access Error"" halts on the RX-V675. The period between halts varied from 3 to 9 hours. I tried swapping out my router and cable and this did not help. The only way to reset the receiver with this error was to power off/on.Below is the 1st email response from John at Yamaha:""Thank you for your inquiry regarding the Yamaha A/V receiver. Based on the information provided we would suggest doing a soft reset on the receiver by unplugging the AC power cord, wait a few minutes, reconnect, and then test again. If the connection issue continues we would suggest exchanging the unit with the dealer.""I exchanged the unit the next day at Costco for an identical model. After connecting everything, I plugged it in. The front LED Screen said ""Main"" for two seconds, and then the unit shut off. I tried to power on again and it was dead. I think it is fair to say the Yamaha factory does not plug them in to see if they work after they make it. Shameful.Below is the 2nd email response from John at Yamaha:""Based on the information provided it sounds like a unique issue just related to the specific unit(s) that you had. In general, the TSR-6750/RX-V675 has been a very good and reliable model. I would suggest trying another.""I returned the RX-V675 and gave up with this model because I had two in a row that were defective.Next, I purchased the Yamaha Advantage RX-A730. My logic was - this model is in the top Yamaha audiophile line and costs more money, so it must have better quality parts.Unbelievably, I began having the same ""Access Error"" problem with my RX-A730 while streaming Pandora as I did with the RX-V675. One late evening while deciding what to do, I did a test. While Pandora was streaming on the RX-A730, I also setup my Blu-ray and my PC to stream Pandora as well. All 3 were hardwired to the same router and high-speed cable modem. You guessed it, I woke in the morning with the familiar Yamaha ""Access Error"", while the other two devices were still happily streaming.Below is the 3rd email response from John at Yamaha:""Truthfully, we haven't had any reported issues with Pandora streaming services. As you can imagine we do have many customers that use this service. We do get calls here and there - however, they typically are password or networking issues. If you want, as a test, we can try your account on a receiver here. I use Pandora on a few receivers here - with my own personal account - and haven't had any issues.""Enough is enough! After being a happy Yamaha customer for 20+ years, I decided to look elsewhere for my next AV Receiver and felt like I was cheating on my wife. However, I am happy to say now that I have found someone new and her name is ""Denon AVR-X2000,"" and she works perfectly.Google ""Yamaha access error"" and you will find hits dating back to 2011. Plus, there is also a similar post for the $1,100 Yamaha RX-A1020 on Company A.Goodby Yamaha."
971,"Bought at a gold box special price for my teenage daughter to bring to school  because of the reviews. She needed cheap earbuds because things were getting stolen.I noticed that she wasn't using them. She said they were &#34;OK&#34; and shrugged so I tried them out and discovered that there is a huge difference in sound between left and right. Okay maybe not huge to a normal listener, but I am used to using $300 headphones and earbuds so I know the difference between basic quality , cheap quality, and pure garbage.These fall in the pure garbage category. I think the 5 star reviews here are from &#34;girly girls&#34; who are rating them on how pretty they are and are probably listing to mp3's on their iphones and think they are &#34;super-cute!!&#34;.  Trust me, don't buy them for their accoustic properties or if you are planning on listening to anything for longer than 2 minutes and don't want a headache."
972,"1. This model only has drivers for Windows XP. Samsung does not provider drivers for any other OS. This is absurd for a Windows 8 laptop.2. If you need warranty, Samsung lets you to send the laptop to their Texas facility, at your cost, and wait 1-2 months to get it back and hope it's fixed. Even for parts that can be easily replaced, they won't just send you the part to exchange or send someone to do it...3. No BIOS updates available. Samsung probably picked up some OEM laptop and labeled them Samsung. Thus no support at all, just like a scam.4. The fan control algorithm is bugged. The CPU keeps hitting 220F degrees and the fan does not run at full speed. The laptop gets dangerously hot and cpu forced to throttle which makes it extremely slow.5. Hard drive performance is terrible. Yeah it has i7 quad-core but with hard drive is the bottleneck.6. Battery time about 3 hours.Never buy a Samsung product. They do not stand behind their products....."
973,"Admittedly I have previously used a Nikon D90 which is known for its crisp photos. The D90 is a 12 MP camera and the DSC HX300 is a 20 MP camera. When you read that a camera is about the sensor and not the pixels, believe it. The Sony DSC HX300 may have almost twice the pixel count, but the pictures are not even half as good, as sharp or with as much detail.The auto focus does function, but very very slowly. That one word describes almost every feature of the camera - SLOW. The zoom is exceedingly slow and the auto  focus even slower. I used the camera with a Class 10 SDHC 32GB card that functions superbly fast in my Nikon, but takes one to two seconds to write from the Sony DSC HX300. While this may not seem like much of a delay, it is significant if you want to take more than one picture of an object. Children, animals, sports and most other live photo opportunities just don't stand still and wait for you to shoot one picture, wait for the camera to write to the card, then shoot another. If an object is moving, all you will get is a blur no matter the ISO setting used.The camera is supposed to work well for sports, wildlife and other normal types of shots. It doesn't. Again, the delays in shooting, focusing and zooming spoil many photo opportunities. I tried taking pictures of my dogs at play which is easy with the Nikon, but almost impossible with the Sony.While the camera advertises that it will shoot bursts at a high rate of speed this is not the case when using a higher quality image. I knew that the camera did not take pictures in RAW, but the JPG even at the finest resolution the Sony is capable of is simply not up to par.I very much wanted this camera to work for me, as it would significantly replace the amount and weight of gear I would have to take with me on a day outing or for travel. It is so light and plastic-y that it is hard to steady properly anywhere past half zoom. The build quality seems lacking and more toy-like than most cameras I have used.The instructions that come with the camera flat out state that the camera will pick up noise from the shutter and the zoom if you use it with movie mode. It does. I tried the movie mode, and while the picture was fairly good, you could clearly hear the motor of the zoom and some other extraneous noise from the camera on the playback.I dislike reviews that totally pan an item. It always sounds to me like the writer has it in for the manufacturer or there is something else driving the bad review. I wish that were the case here. For the first time, I am writing a review that really downgrades an item.  I did a good bit of on-line research about the ultra-zoom bridge camera sector and thought that based on pre-release reviews and analysis of the camera that it would be a hit. Unfortunately I just couldn't recommend this camera to anyone whether a novice, enthusiast or other user.The summary is that unless you want the camera to take pictures of static objects like scenery, buildings, statues or the like, this isn't the camera for you. It definitely doesn't work for vacations, action, children, pets, wildlife or anything that moves.This has nothing to do with my review of the camera, but be careful about buying this item from Company A or any dealer on-line for that matter. I am trying to return the camera, but Company A is telling me that there is no refund on this item. I didn't see that warning when I bought the camera, but you should be aware of that. If you make a mistake buying this camera, you're probably stuck with it. For me, it was an expensive lesson."
974,No sound at all from the device after less than 2 months.Was okay while it worked though; not as good sounding as I expected.
975,"I purchased this 4 months ago.  First of all the picture quality is not as one would expect once you hear the word 'Quattron"", meaning 4 engines, meaning fast refresh rate, meaning sharper image.  All of a sudden there was bar (black or fuzzy) about 6 inches wide appeared on the right side of the TV, 12 inches from the edge.  After calling Company A at first , I was told to call SHARP because the TV is still under warranty and Company A can not do anything about it outside of 30 days.  I called SHARP and after talking to at least 3 reps and trying to reset and hard reset and all other tricks, they asked me to take pictures of the screen and send them to SHARP.  At this point I can not get an answer from SHARP as to what the problem is, I can't get any help from Company A, I have a TV that is not working right and I am out almost 4k for a TV that could possibly be a refurbished one.  This is not the first big screen TV in my house, as I have a Phillips 63, Vizio 55, and Panasonic 65.  But this is the first LCD TV as the others were all Plasma.  I will update this review if and when I get any resolution to this problem.  Beware, you are not buying a sharp picture tv, you are buying a SHARP.  and apparently the customer support is not very sharp either.Part 2After taking 13 pictures, as instructed by SHARP, and trying to send it to the Email address I was given I got 3 warnings in 3 days from Gmail saying that the recipient's server does not accept the email with attachment, I tried Zipping the files or sending it JPG, or even unsecured to no avail.  So SHARP wants you to send them pictures but they don't want to receive them.  I contacted Company A again and much to my surprise they offered a refund or replacement.  I didn't want a refund but I also didn't want another SHARP.  I ended up ordering the M series of VIZIO.  The 240 HTZ has much sharper image than SHARP, but more about that review under VIZIO.  Company A customer service is number one and there is a reason for this company being so successful.  It has to do with their customer service.  While the same could not be said about SHARP.  Just to give you an example, at one point, in order to rest the TV I had to hold 2 buttons , channel up and power, at the same time while plugging the TV.  This obviously can not be done with one person, so I wonder what would someone who had nobody else in the house do?  Every rep who answered the phone asked me to unplug and plug the TV , as if that would do a miracle.  As of this writing, almost 2 weeks after , I still have not heard back from SHARP.My rating of SHARP stays the same and too bad I can not rate Company A's first class service in this review."
976,"Bought this TV for our rental condo in Florida. Bought it at H.H. Gregg. After 10 weeks it had no picture. The manager of our rental unit kindly took it back to H.H. Gregg to get a replacement only to be told: "" you have to send it back to Toshiba"". He called Toshiba and they were equally unhelpful. We will throw this new TV and buy one of the top rated (by customers) Samsung or LG TV's. No more H.H. Gregg or Toshiba TV's for us...ever!"
977,"Terrible Antenna, doesnt pick any channels and powered cords do not work together. Do not buy. Piece of crap. Would return if I could."
978,"The radio stopped working after one week. I still use it bc the clock still works. But, I bought a clock radio."
979,I would not recommend this product.It did not hold a charge and there is no way to tell when or if it is charged.
980,This is a clever little knock-off. Wasn't mhl 2.0 because it said that it needed power to run. But that didn't matter because it didn't work at all.
981,"i bought these for my MeMo FDH 10.1, the first attempt at installing these was to try the dry install, and it left so many bubbles even after using the squeegee, which put light scratches on the &#34;protector&#34; that i was turned off from using it, and you have to use heavy scraping pressure to move the air bubbles. install attempt two-i took it back off, then sprayed Windex on the screen to help eliminate the bubbles, and it worked much better, the squeegee pushed the Windex out and left a bubble free screen. but wait for it...after drying the night, i turned on the tablet the next morning and dry bubble residue was back. it makes the screen look ugly to me. as a product designer i think the plastic material is to hard the get a clear adhesion to glass. my opinion the material needs to be softer. and the camera holes didn't match the great either.i would like my money back please for these.S.W."
982,"I'm going to take the time to write a rather detailed review because I like Wacom (their Intuos Pro tablet has really made my life a lot easier!) and I think my thoughts might help other people trying to decide. First let me say that I bought the stylus with the intentions of taking notes with it. I know some people use a stylus to navigate their tablet, but that is not why I ordered it. I love the fact that I can use my fingers on my iPad Air, and I see no reason to carry an extra accessory to accomplish something that my finger does better. However, I recognize that some people don't want to get fingerprints on their screen or (for whatever reason) have trouble using their fingers.Now, as to the Bamboo stylus, I really hate it! My hand still hurts from using it, and I only tried it out for about a half hour! There are several problems, which when combined left my hand aching. And, BTW, I am in my early 30s and have no problems with my hands, so it really does cause discomfort (another reviewer had posted about their hand hurting, and when I read the review, I rolled my eyes assuming that the person had arthritis or something. Stupid me, I should have listened because they were spot on).The first problem is that the tip is soft, and I mean really soft (think of bubble gum after having been chewed on for awhile, which is different than the hard rubber of an eraser, which is what I thought it was going to be like). In order to get the stylus to register you have to push down until the tip squishes out. The softness is good in that it squishes easily, but it is deceptive. You'd think that since it squishes so easily it wouldn't be hard to keep the level of pressure needed. However, it requires constant pressure to keep the tip squished down like that, and that pressure (squishy or not) starts to hurt after awhile.When I tried to take notes, I found myself writing in cursive because it was just easier to keep the tip squished rather than having to keep squishing it down on every keystroke. But even writing in cursive required a tight grip on the stylus in order to ensure enough pressure was used to get it to register on screen. This constant pressure is annoying at first, but within 15 minutes it leaves your hand aching. Have you ever written an angry letter, and gripped the pen just a tad harder than you usually would? Its not a lot, but your hand becomes tired very quickly. This is the same thing that happens when using the Bamboo stylus.The next problem is that the stylus is too small. I will post a picture with my review that shows me holding the stylus and you can see how small it is in my hand. Now, I know that I have big hands, but the stylus seems to be designed with children in mind or something. I could live with the short length, but the stylus itself is just too thin. Since I needed to keep pressure on it for it to write, I found the small girth added to the ache in my hand. It really is too small to hold comfortably, and there is no way to use a &#34;light touch&#34; and still have the thing register.The last problem, and this applies mostly to note taking, is that it just wasn't accurate enough. In order to be sure my letters were going to register, I found myself writing letters that were much larger than I typically would have written. The result was that I was getting an average of about four words in each line. Imagine the number of pages I would be going through taking notes in a meeting? It just wouldn't be feasible.I like the idea of being able to carry my tablet and use it for everything. This stylus, however, makes the note taking process, and complicates it. I am willing to give up some comfort for convenience. And I know that so far they haven't found a way to replicate the ease of a pen on notebook paper. But, the experience has to at least come close. Otherwise, it is just not worth it. This stylus made note taking a literal pain (in the hand and wrist). I simply would not be able to use it for any length of time.In any event, I will be returning this product. I did order another stylus that was specifically designed for jotting notes, and we shall see how that stylus holds up. Maybe it was my fault for not ordering a &#34;fine&#34; point stylus to begin with. I guess I just liked my Wacom tablet enough that I wanted to give them a chance. I wanted to like this product, I really did. Unfortunately, I just couldn't."
983,It was great when it was working.  Died after a few months of use.  All data gone.  Flash drives are supposed to be very reliable?  Not.
984,Don't bother it's not a good product. I think the screen is fine without it. I made a mistake ordering this.
985,It broke in less that a month although I stored the Ipad within another bag. Love the color and design though.
986,"Whoever designed the Cube UI should get fired. Completely unusable.Whoever thought adding 30+ bookmarks to random internet sites should also get fired. First thing I did was deleted all the bookmarks.  There are also lot of bloat apps you can't remove.In the Play Store there is not one game for this system is compatible. Compared to Ouya, this this feels like an abandoned wasteland and should not be marketed as a game machine or say Games on the box.My logitech revue google tv that is 3+ years older has a much better UI. Why does each company think they need to make a custom UI. (Samsung TouchWiz sucks soo bad.)  Basic Google TV UI is really good, just use it people.The remote is bad. The UI is bad. OS is loaded with bloat. Compared to the Ouya (which is also a cube) this is just a large paperweight.For Google to do so good with Android mobile, I can't understand why Google TV keeps failing with each new device."
987,"Probably just got a lemon, worked fine for a week then the write speed dropped to x0.5.  Returned for refund."
988,"Even though my iPad was able to notice their set-up screen, my laptop was not.I had no way of setting this repeater up even when it was plugged in less than 3 feet away.I tried a variety different options to try to get this to work with not success.  It was returned for prompt refund."
989,"I bought both the Neewer 560 and 660 and used them a few times, then both units failed. I rarely get the cheapest provider but I need a lot of stobes for my job and thought I'd experiment with these. The experiment failed and I feel like I got exactly what I paid for."
990,"No use to me. My video files are on a Synology NAS and the MX2 can't access the shares. ""Operation not permitted"" whatever you try, and considering how painful the XBMC on-screen keyboard is to use, esp when used with the horrible MX2 remote, this one is best left for the real enthusiasts, or playing files locally off USB drives. My Apple TV2, Windows PC and iPhone running FileBrowser all have no problem with the same shares so I guess it's an Android issue. It was able to see the shares & files through uPnP but it crashed, hung or just gave up on any file I tried. Comes with one of those nasty, poor photocopy type user guides, unreadable, unintelligible and quite pointless. Remote is one of those big squidgy button jobs that you squeeze away at hoping to hit the sweet spot. Blue LED on the front of unit is bright enough to scare the dog."
991,This lasted for only a week. The wire connections are very thin and not soldered on well. I had to fix it with some soldering myself. I went a head and replaced this with the more sturdy adapter without the wire as this is quite useless even with the carefullest of hands.
992,"I bought 2 at ~$15 each, and I do not expect them to ever pay for themselves. At $80, there's absolutely no chance. DO NOT BUY!"
993,"This is very cheaply made and had I known where it came from I would not have bought it.  I'm looking for another one now, because this does not fit very well.  It's ok, but I would not buy it again or suggest anyone to."
994,"0 star rating for shipping a product that doesn't work (charging seems to cycle on/off with my Droid 4 phone and Nexus 7 tablet)+ 0 star rating for not calling out the fact that this product lacks the accessories that it's normally shipped with (yes, I know it technically lists &#34;Package contents: Anker Astro E5 External Battery, Micro USB cable, travel pouch, instruction manual.&#34; at the top, but it also uses the same product ID as the full product, includes the pics of the accessories, and was evidently sold from this page with the normal full accessories, so pretty dang misleading...).+0 obviously not retail packaging with nothing sealed or anything+0 scratch across bottom of battery (combined with packaging, *pretty* sure that this &#34;NEW&#34; item is in fact 'previously loved...')+1 star Company A minimum= 1 STAR RATING WOOOT!!!Oh, yeah, have to return it now...

995,"first off this was my first tablet and I researched this so much I knew if it didn't fit it would be the TABLET not my ignorance! SECOND: I really wanted to like it,I ordered one it didn't work, got a replacement that one wasn't worth opening!I'm very simple so I wasn't expecting KINMidnight or IPAD, but I didn't think id be reinstalling firmware and troubleshooting this to death, it was POSSESSED shutting off & on like poltergeist!! I took it on my trip and couldn't even use my hotels free WI-FI (why I got it) for the first day without wasting valuable vacation time!SO what I did get out of this, is NOW I know what kind of tablet NOT to get!BTW I never buy nor would recommend as some do EVER,EVER buying something like this that isn't fulfilled by Company A,(no matter how good a deal) that way within 30 days refunds and replacements are a breeze."
996,"I agree with many other reviews that this receiver requires a lot of tweaking to actually &#34;work&#34; out of the box.My biggest problem with this receiver was the way that the HDMI signal transmitted.  For example: when playing Rock Band, I noticed a ton of lag which basically makes the game unplayable.  Also, I was noticing that the voice was off for other programming (e.g. TVs and movies).  After hours of frustration and research, I learned that these &#34;lags&#34; were occurring because the receiver automatically defaults all HDMI inputs to &#34;conversion mode&#34; - meaning the receiver is trying to convert all HDMI signals to 1080p (even if they are already coming in 1080p).  Because &#34;additional processing&#34; is required to up-convert video, the receiver introduces about 80-90 milliseconds of lag when using their default &#34;conversion mode.&#34;  But, I have to ask, why on earth would someone want to use this &#34;conversion mode&#34; at the expense of what - I'd consider - is considerable lag? I should also point out that the conversion mode picture is garbage too (compared to the original image that you get with conversion mode turned off).  So, basically, the default conversion option is useless (yet Pioneer thinks we want it on by default).  Oh, and you have to turn this mode off manually for every input that you use.  Talk about a nuisance.The actual reason I'm returning this receiver, however, is because it started bugging out in two ways.1. During an xbox session, the sound suddenly started becoming very choppy (due to some glitch in the receiver).  This was fixed after resetting the receiver but was still very concerning given I've never seen such a thing happen with an Onkyo or a Yamaha.  Call me picky but if something like this happens once (in the first month of ownership), it&#8217;s not worth the risk.2. Some of the buttons on the remote stopped registering with the receiver (the audio and video parameter buttons).  What's weird is that the receiver, itself, is what's not accepting the signal from the remote.  Even the same functions on my harmony remote don't register with the receiver although the receiver still accepts the function when you press the physical button on the receiver&#8230; weird!Anyway, all of this happened in the first 30 days of ownership so I will happily be returning this unit - probably for a Marantz this time around."
997,I was not happy with this at all. The installation causes you to either pull back on the arms on the rear (snapping one off in the process) or scratch your screen with the front corners. Once installed the vertical arms crowd into the edge of the Garmin Screen (not enough to obscure info but hang over the edge) Also once on is extremely loose and slides around if on a bumpy or uneven surface road. The loose fit is also a hassle if you remove the unit frequently (to keep the unit from being stolen) and will result in having to re install each time due to the loose fit.
998,"Sure the cable still charges my phone what what is the purpose if it doesn't stay in.I purchased 3 of these cables and they all worked nice for about 2 weeks. Then after that they stopped staying inside the phone. The little prongs on the micro usb end stayed depressed, which does not keep it inside the phone. If I bump my phone at all while it is charging the cable falls out."
999,"Dont buy - not a resonant frequency anywere on ham band. 5:1+ swr.

1000,"Mixed up the review to show how the Nook changed with Updates within 12 hours of opening the box.Opened the Nook packaging with great anticipation. The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Company A to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Company A. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this."
1001,"This travel kit takes too much space. If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle. A cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit, and  it's better. Remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if  you have a computer with an infrared port, but this drains the batteries a  lot."
1002,"I used to think these are good but as I realized it was more a placebo thing because 1) I used to think Sony makes the best electronics so it would naturally include headphones 2) I was ignorant in the world of headphones.  Do your research, Sony is not even close to being in par with the best headphones manufacturers like Sennheiser, Grado, and AKG.  These brands are, in my opinion, the best in the business.  After listening to jazz with my AKG 702 and switching over to the Sony, I feel like just throwing this piece of garbage on the wall like really hard.  The sound coming from it sucks so bad in comparison with my AKG.  Don't believe me?  Read all the bad reviews in any review web site, not just this site, and you will hear the same thing: muddy.  Sony headphones sound muddy.  I own 3 Sony headphones and they all have the same characteristics: loud, muddy, and bassy.  Now 1 and 3 are not bad qualities, but 2 is just unacceptable for anyone looking for good sound.  Now these will for sure sound better than really cheap portable headphones or your ipod buds, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are any good."

1004,"I tried in my sunny garden to baseline the quality and it did not come out good.  Comparable to CVS pharmacy disposable 35mm.  It went downhill from there:  The underwater pictures were not worth it.  Out of all the pictures, there was only one of my dog splashing into the pool that is kinda keeper.  But, it's 6 bucks.  So, c'mon, experiment with it.  If you don't like it after that, you're out 15 - 20 bucks after developing."
1005,"I've used Plantronics headsets for years.  I was surprised that there was no volume adjustment for the Mic -- every other Plantronics headset I've used had one.  I must have had a dozen people tell me they could hardly hear me in 3 days of use.  No amount of adjusting the headset position on my head solved the problem..  I had to pull the mic nearly into my mouth for people to hear me easily.Pity - other than that, it was perfect. I'm returning it."
1006,"This bag might have been &quot;built for larger digital cameras and smaller digital camcorders&quot; but it isn't big enough for them!  If you get this, you'll find you have to squash your cam in there with little room for other supplies in the main compartment.  Also, the front pocket looks nice, but it only holds conventional items and can;t be made to fit what YOU want to hold.  Pass on this one and check out Case Logic bags if you have a digital camera."
1007,"Ultimately, I ended up throwing this WAP away after it stopped functioning.  You are far better off spending the extra money for an 802.11g WAP (54 Mbps versus 11 Mbps).Unlike other WAPs, this device can connect to another WAP and act as a bridge.  If you have two Ethernet networks and want to connect them, it is relatively painless with this device.  That was my original rationalization for buying this product.  Turns out I never really needed the extra functionality.I was never impressed with the 10 Mbps speed. The first time around setup was painless.  However, reinstalling the software under XP became problematic.  The USB driver/software from Linksys caused my Windows XP machine to blue-screen and crash.  It caused my Windows ME system to hang periodically.I would recommend you pass on this product and get an 802.11g WAP.  They are faster (54/100+Mbps) AND backwards compatible with your existing 802.11b network cards."
1008,"I bought the MDR-NC5 headphones for a trip from SF to Chicago, and they were sorely disappointing.... I thought that I would get noise reduction and better sound quality.  This is not the case.Sound:- With noise-cancelling off, the headphones sound terribly weak and thin.  They sound no better than my $15 Sony in-ear headphones.  There is no bass response on these headphones.- With noise-cancelling on, the headphones managed to block out about 50% of the airplane noise.  However, there was still a significant amount of rumble noise.  Sound quality was still thin, but prevailed over the cabin noise due to the noise cancellation feature.  The headphones have an on-ear design, so it lets in a lot more noise than models that cover and surround your ears completely.Comfort:- These headphones press directly on ear.  The earpads are padded, but the headband is not padded.  After an hour, I started to feel a bit of soreness on my ears because they pressed a little too hard on them.The few positives:- Compact.  They fold up (which is why the headband isn't padded), and they fit easily into your carry-on luggage.- Price.  They are somewhat cheap for noise-cancelling headphones.  But as my review implies, you get what you pay for.- Circuitry:  All the electronics (including the on/off switch are located on the headphones, and not on a box between the headphones and the plug.I might have been more satisfied with these headphones, except that I shared my connecting flight with my brother who has the Bose QuietComfort headphones ....  I tried those headphones out, and they are absolutely amazing.  They fully cover your ears, have a padded headband, sound much better, and block out substantially more noise than the Sony MDR-NC5.  The trade-offs are that they have the intermediate box that houses the batteries and the noise-cancellation switch and that they are not very compact.  Having tried the Bose model, I realize the full potential of noise-cancelling headphones and the cost associated with them.  You definitely get what you pay for in these situations.I discourage anyone from buying these headphones.  Please spend more money for better models....  I am going to try out the Sony MDR-NC20 headphones which have an over-the-ear design, so they *should* provide better blocking of external noise."
1009,Overall the sound quality is very good.The ear cushions are too small to fit over your ear and are uncomfortable to wear.The head band is marked with a L and a R but it is marked the wrong way to have the headband parallel to your head which makes me wonder which speaker is wired right and which is left. I mostly use these for watching movies and which side is which can make a big difference.All in all I'm going to buy a different headset in the near future.
1010,"This is nothing more than vinyl hose that might be used on newer washing machines, split down the middle.  Buy yourself some hose at Lowe's, along with five zip ties, and (Oila!) save some money.It is painful on the hands to insert the cables into the contraption, and once you bind it all together, it's not much more compact than at the start.  I would have done beter using zip ties alone."
1011,"Sony had a good thing going with their CX400 MegaChanger.  Unfortunately they tinkered with it and the end result is a nightmare.  Gone are the eight music category buttons you could use to quickly categorize each music CD.  Gone is the speed of the earlier units:  this unit takes almost 30 seconds to change from one CD to another and about that long to initialize after it is powered-up.  Gone is the ability to change from continuous to shuffle or one disc play to all disc play modes while the CD unit is playing; you must now first stop the unit before changing modes.  Worst of all, this unit scrambles the link between artist names and their associated CD's.  Sony is aware of this problem but cannot fix it and ""officially"" denies it exists.  We should know:  we've been thru four of these units trying to find one that works as advertised.  None of them do.Yes, this unit will play MP3 encoded CD's.  Big deal.  MP3's on a CD player are pretty-much worthless since you've no way to control the music selection within a given disc (no artist or album select options within the disc).  Also, you cannot view the track title for the disc on this CD player until the track cues-up.Save your money.  Reject the Sony CX455."
1012,"I've used a few of these with friends and determinedthe range is poor, I can't even get from one sideof the house to the other...I swapped inSMC units, and they were fine.I suspect the radio is lower power than others.The netgear G unit does much better in terms of rangeeven running at B speeds."
1013,"If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS.

1014,These tapes used to work OK for me.Not now.  Almost every one of them I used this summer had one or more timecode breaks / dropouts when using in my Canon XH-A1 camera.

1016,"The industrial design on this product is great!  Compact design, and a slick folding antenna.The driver/software support is horrible.  It took me 2 days to get it working with a Sony VAIO.  The software install disk failed and I had to manually install the drivers and the documentation provided was poor and didn't cover all the properties settings for the drivers.The worst problem is that Linksys claims this product is &quot;hot swappable&quot; which is a half-truth.  You can plug it in and it will activate, but if you unplug it, then plug it in again, it will not reactivate.  If you check the Linksys support FAQ, they admit &quot;You may require a reboot after unplugging the device&quot;.  Hardly &quot;hot swappable&quot;..."
1017,"Bought this camera along with the accessory pack for my daughter as a college graduation present in May 2004.It recently dropped out of her purse into a puddle, it was in its case.  It worked initially, then stopped working.The company offers nothing to replace or fix this camera other than she can spend 150.00 to get a refurbished one or she can send it in to be repaired which would cost over 200.00.That seems out of line for a camera which cost 219.00 originally and you can get now for 175.00.They didn't even offer to look at it for no fee and give options for repair or credit for purchase of another canon camera.She was very happy with the performance of this camera and is devistated that all is now lost. I will be hesitant to purchase another canon product."

1019,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago.  They fit very well and sound good, and if that were all I would give them four or five stars.  I paid close to $40 dollars for them (not through Company A).  However, they suffer from one major defect:  the insulation around the very flexible cord has failed.  The reason?  Well I think they cannot withstand the heat as found in a closed car during the summer.  After doing that once, the cord started to feel ""gummy"" and started to stick together.  The cord never recovered and now the insulation has broken in several places.  You could say this is my fault; however I think this device should be designed to withstand these sorts of temperatures.  I live in the Northeast...I can't imagine that these will fare any better in the South or anywhere else it gets hot.There are two other more minor ""problems"" with these headphones.  First, without the extension they are very short.  They are good for an armband mp3 player, but you'll need the extension for anything else.  Second, I use them when I work out (and sweat).  I found that once in awhile they ""clog up"" and stop working and need to be dried out.  This may happen with any in-ear design...so I don't know if this is specific to Sony's design."
1020,"The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters."
1021,"Although I'm not a computer novice, this unit was hard to install. While the green LAN (Ethernet) light came on when plugged into the router or DSL modem, it didn't work when plugged directly into my PC or laptop. Someone here wrote that in such case you need a ""crossover"" ethernet cable (or adapter). THANK YOU! I learned that routers have the smarts to figure our what type of unit is plugged in, and automatically assign transmit and receive signals to the proper pins. My PC and laptops didn't do that, and the DP-311U wasn't smart enough either. Hence I needed the cross-over cable (just for the one-time setup). Sad thing, before I figured this out, I spoke with 2 people at D-Link's technical support; we spent easily two hours. But neither one suggested the cross-over cable. They must have had tons of calls like this before. Of course, the manual says mothing about this either. Amazing how they waste time and money."
1022,"I, like you, were reading reviews on this device and saw mixed responses. Purchased the product 2 days ago and here's what I found;Device works great when you install the device and will continue to work correctly until you shut down your CPU or it goes to standby or sleep. After sleep mode or stand by, I had to manually assign the device an IP address then ""ping"" for test in the IPCONFIG. HASSLE and there's no way my wife could have figured this out. There is something not correct with the software for this device after you turn off your drivers.Spent 45 minutes on the 24 hour support from Lynksys and they couldn't figure the problem either so they said I have a OS problem. Funny.Today I purchased Motorola's version pn 512720-001-00 and have had no problems.Final comments, if you are running Windows XP and never plan to shut down your CPU or turn onto standby, this is a great product. For the 98% of us that send our CPU's to sleep, proceed with caution!"
1023,"Unfortunately, I figured out just how BAD my copy was, outside the return window. Horrible CA and complete focus mess. Couldn't even micro-focus adjust it, as it would bounce between +15 for close-up subjects and -10 for far away ones. I attempted to use this exclusively at F1.4, otherwise why buy this lens? If you can't afford the gamble and return game, stick to the F1.8 version. It's MUCH more reliable."
1024,"Ok this was my first buy on Company A.. I bought 2 of the Tripp Lite TMC-6 TouchMaster Compact Surge Suppressor.. My nabor came to me and Gave me the box that was shipped.

Not very pleased with my first buy from here..Oh and a week Later there 20 bucks now insted of 30."
1025,"I bought this CD recorder several years ago.  At that time, it was about the only CD recorder available.  I suppose that's because most people use their computers to make their CD compilation disks.  But I don't make mixes that way, so I needed a CD recorder.My biggest complaint about this CD recorder is that it has ruined so many CD-Rs.  I'll record the whole 70 or so minute CD, hit finalization, it will count down the 1:04 of finalization, get to the last second and say ""Incomplete!""  The manual says this is due to vibration, but there is no vibration around.  This repeated trouble has made me hate this machine.The second complaint is that whenever I want to use it, even after several years, I have to refer to the owner's manual, and often I still have trouble figuring out exactly what I have to do.Here are my recording practices.  First, I don't want to record from computer because my music files are compressed (I don't have enough hard drive space to not compress them into AAC format).  Second, I like to make music mixes that are intermixed, with one song starting before the other one is finished.  This, too, can be done on computer with DJ programs, but again, the music is compressed.  So I record all my music on my stereo system's Mini-Disc recorder.  Unlike CD, MD is a dream to record on.  After recording, I can divide, combine, and move tracks, and there's no such thing as finalization...I can do this any old time I please.  After my music mix is perfected, then I record it onto CD so I can put it on my computer and play the CD in my car.  So at least when the CD recorder says ""Incomplete,"" I haven't lost my music mix, just some time and yet another wasted CD.I can't even imagine trying to record a compilation CD on this thing.  I have made some direct CD-to-CD recordings within the machine using program play, but only with minimal programming, and certainly only with the maximum of 5 discs the play deck can hold (rather than trying to do a second program or adding tracks individually).  But every time I want to use program play to record, I have to review the instructions.  My Mini-Disc recorder, on the other hand, is easy to use.  (It's also a Sony, and I love my Mini-Disc recorder.  I hate this CD recorder.)"
1026,Sandisk truly needs to learn how to create packaging people can open. This company has not discovered how to be centered on the customer yet.
1027,"The compatability issues with XP Service Pack 2 are known and well documented ... what's unknown is why Linksys has chosen not to address them by updating their USBBT100 drivers and removing the hoops and hassle users of this common Windows OS must endure to install their product.If, like me, you are considering the Linksys USBBT100 as a way to hot-synch data between your Palm or smart phone (I recently purchased a Treo 650) and you are running XP SP2, think again. It's not impossible, but the end -- hours on the phone with support, multiple installs and uninstalls -- may not justify the means. I can't tell you how long it will eventually take, nor can I confirm it is actually possible, because I never got there.Despite the lack of any existing documentation on the Linksys site or in the product packaging providing instructions how to set up the USB adapter with a wireless device like a smart phone, I did eventually get to the point where I could do a single one-click data synch. But it was more of a try-everything, hit-or-miss path to get there ...However, every time I booted up my PC, I had to unplug and re-plug the adapter to get my phone to recognize it -- again, a known and documented issue. When I followed the XP SP2 step-by-step instructions in the website FAQ for fixing this, it made matters worse, not better.My first doubts were raised when I searched the Linksys site for the most recent drivers and discovered that the last update was in 2003. Not a good sign.No one at Palm or Verizon was able to help me. Having called Linksys support in the past, I wasn't even about to go there. At one time I spoke with a second-level support technician at Palm that questioned why I would want to hot-synch via Bluetooth in the first place, because it was much slower than using the cable.Hmmmm. Good question ... and one whose answer eventuallly led me to stop spending my time, and tolerance capital, seeking a solution to this problem instead of simply returning the Linksys adapter to Company A and spending my money on a Treo 650 docking cradle instead.This is not a knock against Bluetooth or Linksys. Bluetooth technology is great for wireless phone headsets, and Palm keyboards, etc., but apparently not for hot-synching data. And in spite of its challenges with end-user direct support, Linksys is a great company that I know and trust. I own about four Linksys products and they have all been rock-solid and straightforward to install and set up.My advice is to carefully evaluate your specific requirements and decide if the USBBT100 is something that meets your needs -- or is something you need in the first place. It may be that a cable or docking cradle is cheaper, easier and provides a faster data transfer rate."
1028,"I like to read a lot of reviews before purchasing any electronic item and these headphones were no exception.  The majority of people rated it very highly so I was sold on the item.  Now onto the review;The Good: It's fairly priced for what you get.  I've searched everywhere for a decent wireless set that doesn't cost triple digits and these fit the bill.  Sennheiser has a great reputation and they have some really nice headphones (but you'll have to really open your wallet for the good stuff... this model was not one of those).  The headphones are extremely comfortable and I was surprised by how light they were.  The item looks like it was constructed really well also (so it was light but well made :).The Bad:  Others have mentioned this as well but I have to say, the whole issue of the base shutting off when the audio source volume is too low really bothered me.  I guess I understand the mechanics of the thing (the better the source, the better the headphones are able to pic up the sound etc.) but there should have been a warning or instructions about this issue at least.  I had to read reviews here and online forums to figure out that it was not just a faulty headset.  I've had my set for 4 weeks now and the headphones have dropped out on me more than half the time, WITHOUT my source volume decreasing.  I don't know what the deal is but I'm ready to return them.  The item seems to work when it wants to which is not how I like my electronics.  Sound quality was ok to good, depends on how many wireless items you going on in the area.  I could never really get the ""static"" to go away completely either (after lots of fine tuning, you still hear it faintly).  I guess you get what you paid for but still, next time I'll shill out for some Bose ones or something as these are pretty frustrating."
1029,"I am disappointed with Sennheiser regarding the RS120.  Constant hiss and loss of signal when moving.  I had a Radio Shack 90 MHz earphones, much cheaper that have better sound quality and very reliable.  Unfortunately, they no longer sell this, as I have worn out the charging system and the unit needs help.  I will return the Sennheiser RS120 and hope to find one more reliable and hiss free."
1030,This supposedly supports port trunking but I couldn't get it to work and it does not support LACP. Speeds were just ok otherwise...
1031,"Just to start this, I intended to get headphones with a mic and I came so close to returning these right then and there. However, the was really good. The cannons and line infantry in Empire: Total War were epic to hear. All of the guns in Killing Floor were crippling. Amnesia: The Dark Descent was an incredible experience with the most engaging audio of any game. With these outstanding performances, I opted to keep the headphones.The headphones sold here have three cables for the 5.1 surround sound plugs in your sound card. The phones I received are USB and have an inline volume control. I had to go into the software to lower the volume by 20 decibels to make the set tolerable to wear, but even at these low volumes there is an audible and annoying hiss. Also, sometimes the sound would be distorted and almost 8-bit in its quality.I am now beyond the return date for these and I can occasionally have a great experience, but that is rare enough that I never use these. And plugging them in completely deactivates my computer speakers and forces me to restart my computer without the headphones connected to get them back.Overall, a potentially excellent set is marred by inconsistent quality and poor usability."
1032,"What many people don't realize is that Toshiba switched the innards of this unit somewhere in 2004.The high rating on the review website and CR were based on earlier units built around the Toshiba TC90602FG chipset. Then Toshiba in all their infinite wizdumb decided to completely rework this thing, changing the innards to a whole new setup using the Zoran Vaddis 6 chipset, and continue calling it by the same model number so no one could tell them apart.The Vaddis 6 and variants are the chipsets found in the lowliest of low DVD players like the ones you see for $39 at WallyMart et alYou can not put any credence in those old reviews from players tested with the Toshiba chipset. You now know why the reviews are so lopsided. ""I don't know how you could call this thing bad, it's wonderful!"" and ""Are you crazy? This thing is a pile of doodie!"" are common on any review site.Given the mid 2004 change date you will are almost assured of getting a Zoran chipset. Avoid."

I found this out when I went to the Genius Bar at Apple and was informed of this fact.I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and if I want to get Microsoft Office, I would have to get the 2011 version. The page for this software is misleading in that it does not clarify this crucial exemption to people who are considering buying it."

1035,"I bought this to help maintain the temperatures when using two Gigabyte 7950's in crossfire configuration. I'm also running three 24"" Asus monitors but still generally game on 1 screen at 1080p. This allows me to easily monitor the temperatures through AMD CCC and other programs. I have tried this fan in multiple locations and found that the very bottom PCI slot was the only spot that made it effective at all. Before using this fan, with crossfire enabled and ULPS disabled these were my temps:Top Card without fan:Idle: 51C - 53CLoad: 60C - 70CTop Card with fan at 100%:Idle: 50C - 52CLoad: 60 C - 69 CBottom Card without fanIdle: 42C - 43CLoad: 58C - 65CBottom Card with fan at 100%:Idle: 41C - 43CLoad: 58C - 65CThe load varies more than idle temps because it's averaged between different games.I tested a few games, including DayZ, Arma 3, Assetto Corsa, Far Cry 3, Crysis 3, Witcher 2, and Battlefield 3 and 4, but I am admittedly new to using Crossfire. I've found that Battlefield 3 and 4 both run fairly well with crossfire minus the typical crashes that BF4 has. Using Crysis 3 however, fan or not...I get great frame rates (60+) but even with vsync on, the temps will eventually rise above 80C and the game will start to freeze up, sometimes the video card driver will fail and I have to reboot the computer. This could just be an issue with Crysis 3 and crossfire. Either way, I think that this card does still work as intended, but it has also been around since January 2004, so keep that in mind if you are buying it to lower temps on a new video card since newer cards have MUCH better fan technology (My Gigabyte cards use ""Windforce"" technology which is very effective overall). I am going to look into water cooling my top card next. I'll let you know how it goes. It is also very loud considering how ineffective it is, I would say if your video card was released in the last 4 years then this will not help you."
1036,"I purchased these speakers from Company A and immediately had problems with the charging of the batteries I purchased for them. the indicator lights on both speakers didn't work properly - then stopped working entirely. So, I have no idea if they are charging. This was one of the main reasons I purchased these speakers. When I called the manufacturer, I was referred to several different companies, including Audiovoxx, AB Tech Services, and Thompson, Inc. I got no response from Thompson, surprisingly rude responses from AB Tech Services, and Audiovoxx kept referring me elsewhere, stating that they had nothing to do with these speakers. I finally called a number I was given and was told that the manufacturer of these speakers was Recoton and they had gone bankrupt due to their policy of ""giving lifetime warranty on their speakers."" So, regardless of the quality of these speakers, I can't find anyone to take responsibility for their warranty or repair. Had I known this, I certainly would not have purchased these speakers. The quality of the speakers was good in the beginning. Now, I've noticed a marked decrease in their clarity - especially at higher volume. I only use these inside and with my receiver set to ""flat"" mode, so the signal they are getting is very mild. I have also noticed that I get regular static regardless of what channel I am on. The distance of the speakers to the transmitter is between 6 and 22 feet - with no obstructions in between (no walls or anything). If you are considering buying these speakers, please find someone who will honor their warranty first."
1037,"The designers, in a moment of sheer stupidity, left off the fast-forward and rewind buttons standard in most designs. A couple of days later I finally figured out that you have to hold down the chapter forward/reverse buttons to search through the DVD. The manual is difficult to read, so it contributed to the problem.More importantly, I tried to edit out commercials using the ""hide chapter"" feature, but they showed up anyway when I tried to play the DVD back on my good Samsung DVD player. Also, while the recordings play back OK on this machine, they periodically skip on my Samsung DVD player, which normally plays DVD+R disks fine when I create them on my computer. Disks seem to play OK on an older Toshiba DVD player, so it is probably hit and miss whether or not the disks will play on other devices. I'm not willing to put up with this, so I'm going to pay more for a Toshiba with a built-in hard drive and can really edit out the commercials."
1038,"What a cool design I thought! Griffin seems to be the leader when it comes to accessorizing my Ipod. I had to buy two when they came out. Unfortunately you learn that being the first isn't always the best. Great design horrible sound! My AM radio sounds far superior. Works ok at my office, sitting close to my radio.Hopefully they'll do better on their SMART DECK. Great concept but again I placed my order in February and haven't even seen the product yet. They claimed it would ship in the third quarter and when I emailed the first of September they couldn't give me a ship date. Caveat emptor"
1039,I gave these two stars (as opposed to one) because after the first four broke before even tightening I was able to get one to hold - at least until I can order some better ones!  SAVE your Money - Keep Looking -
1040,"bought 2 of these and have tried to get them to work on 3 different WinXP PCs and laptops, so far only one PC works with it, but will only work when it it is installed in the exact same usb port as it was when software was installed, if I move it to another USB port on the same PC it will not work.  Other 2 PCs would not work at all with this device, installation finishes and the device shows a yellow 'cannot start' status in Windows hardware device manager."
1041,"Company A's description for the Sony BCG-34HD4 charger is misleading. It can only charge 2 AAA battery (not 4 as described in item's description). It doesn't say it on the charger's package and I only found out about it when I opened the box. Now I can't return it.  Please read other reviews before you buy it, don't make the same mistake I did.Otherwise the charger is OK. It's fast and small and easy to use."
1042,You get what you pay for. I was upset that my player did not work with component cables. Works decently with the regular cable and does play multi region DVD's. You are better off investing in a nicer player.
1043,"Positive:+ 3x Optical Zoom+ 1.8"" LCD+ Dock Avaliable+ Many Manual Features+ Internal Memory, But Only 16MB So Almost UselessNegative:- Very Poor Photo Quality- Very Poor Video Quality- Only Lithium Batteries IncludedThe image quality isn't as bad as what some people said, but it's still kinda poor. You probably should do some more research unless you don't mind poor photo quality."
1044,"I should've realized when I first looked at them, but I didn't see it.  Take a look at the picture there, do you see the problem with these speakers?  Like I said, neither did I, not until after I bought them.  The problem: the satellite speakers are hopelessly top-heavy, and the feet they stand on are lightweights. Result is, for me at least, is that they're often dragged around and knocked over.  It's not like my desk is hopelessly cluttered, it's not really, but it takes very little to get them moving, wobbling, shaking. They sound fine, pretty good really, but this shaky-wobble problem is too much for me.I see that the great majority of reviews here are very positive, so maybe it's just me.  But before you dismiss my points, take a close look at Logitech's subsequent 2.1 speaker systems:  Every one has a solid base structures for the satellites, broad bases and low profiles.Should be noted that the satellites are set up for wall mounting, looks pretty simple, and the sub-woofer does have plenty of punch. I'm buying the Altec VS2521 2.1 speaker system now. I'll sell these on Craigslist or just give them away.  Again, they sound fine, but toppled over on their side they leave a lot to be desired."
1045,"If you desire sharpness, then this is not the monitor for you, I ended up returning it after two days, frankly I was dissapointed but don't be ""penny wise pound foolish"" as the saying goes.  Spend a bit more money and get one that will provide a more define picture!"
1046,Doesnt really make all that much difference from what I've noticed. Took them out and didn't see a big change.
1047,"I've used Etymotics for close to three years now, first the ER6 and then these. The ER6s are extremely neutral and crisp sounding, very well balanced. If these were speakers, they'd be $500 for a pair. However, the sound quality has some issues: first, there really is no bass to speak of. The original ER6 had even less, but despite the prominent advertising, the I series adds not much at all. And I've tried the foam pads and the silicon flanges and taken all the approaches to get the ""perfect seal"" and even with the foam pads and a great ""underwater"" sounding seal, the bass is pitiful. I've even used a $200 portable headphone amp, and these sound about the same. Good for acoustic music, or if you don't really like to hear low frequencies.Next downside: these are high maintenance phones. You have to change these wee tiny filters in the tubes every few months or weeks depending on how much ear wax you produce. Otherwise your wax will clog the sound tube up and you will hear muted or no sound in one or both ears. To change the filter, you have to use a wee tiny tool and dig the old ones out and then insert the wee tiny new ones. If you think there is a good chance you might misplace the wee tiny tool or drop the wee tiny filter on the floor while changing them, you may as well just save yourself the aggravation and get another design of headphone. The filters cost $15 for 5 sets and can only be brought from the mfgr or specialty web sites.Besides the filters, you also have to clean the silicon clear plugs if you are using that style. These get all covered with wax and need to be cleaned with soap and warm water and then aired out before reattaching them. You can use foam plugs instead which do not need cleaning, but which do become hard and brittle pretty quickly. They also gradually get coated with wax, so you probably would like to clean them if you could, but you can't as they will never dry. Both ear plug types become worn out over time, the foam ones more quickly than the plastic. You can of course buy new ones, set of 6 at $15 a pop.Ultimately, with all the cleaning of plugs, fiddling around with your ears to get a good seal, buying and changing filters, etc these feel more like owning a pet than like having headphones. Final problem: with a good seal these block out ALL external sounds. So if you are jogging on a street or even commuting in a big city, use these at your own risk, as you will not hear car horns, sirens, explosions etc.Frankly, after my 36 months of high maintenance issues with these, I would still be tempted to almost recommend these for commuters and travelers even with their sound deficiencies, as the complete isolation works well in noisy places and the sound is very clear and neutral. Plus the price has gotten to the point where these are not so terrible a deal. But there's one final fact that puts the nail in the ER6's coffin.The real problem is that the market has moved on. Shures, Ultimate Ears, DJays, even Sennheiser all offer high quality canal phones that are sturdier than the Etys with their brittle thin wires, endless appetite for replacement parts, and hearing aid aesthetic. I now own the Shure SE210s and the UE FI 5 Pro, and both sound lots better than the ER6i, both are far more comfortable, and neither use filters. The design is more attractive, the sleeves last longer, and there is actually audible bass in each of the others. The plugs do not penetrate so unpleasantly deep into the ear canal, but give the same isolation with far fewer cleaning woes. Sure, they both cost more, but even the $70 Shure E2c and the $80 UE Fi 3 are better phones than the ER6i. Etymotic has not modernized their design and the Ety 6is, inadequate objectively, are even more inferior when compared to their competitors. The market has moved on and Etymotic is standing still. Their attempt at innovation is wireless Bluetooth canalphones that make you look like you have credit cards sticking out of your ears. (Why is that considered better than having a wire?) This company, once an innovator, is now old and tired, and IMO not long for the world. Smarter better funded competitors have caught up to them and surpassed them in every way."
1048,"Made the mistake of buying this speaker pair to replace a Altec Lansing computer speaker system. As others have said, not a terrible speaker, but not a 100 dollar speaker either.Bose, which makes some very good products, sold out on this speaker to produce a crappy sounding bass and not much else.  At least according to my ears, the 30 dollar Altec Lansing speaker pair had much better balance and certainly did a better job in the mid-high range.Also, my speaker pair struggles to hold its volume at mid to high volume range and really strains at higher volume. Almost uncomfortable to listen to at anything about mid volume...This speaker system has been in my closet for the better part of two years."
1049,"...I cannot get them to securely fit in my ears, they fall right out because of their shape. They are round, hard plastic, about the size of a dime. Dang, twenty bucks wasted."
1050,"Very good sound at such a low price. However, the earclip kept coming off the earphone and eventually was lost forever. Also, the cord should have a guide on it to prevent it from getting very tangled. I returned the item and was fully refunded."
1051,"I recently bought the iRiver AFT 100 and the Monster A-IP-FM-CH-PS Wireless FM Transmitter and tested both of them in my car, an Acura TL. The Acura has the FM antenna embedded in the rear window which I understand makes using these devices more challenging than if the antenna was an external one. As I live in Tampa, there are a lot of FM stations and so finding an unused frequency without an active station right next to it is a bit of a challenge.Findings: on both units, using a frequency in the middle of the FM dial or higher yielded better results than using one at the lower end of the spectrum (88 to 92). I used different types of music to test the units and found that quieter music was a more challenging test as the background noise was not masked during the quieter passages as it is with Rock or Rap. The bottom line: the iRiver unit performed much better than the Monster unit hands down. The iRiver unit put out a stronger signal limiting background hiss, had a fuller frequency response with limited high frequency clipping and a full rich low end. The Monster unit had a weaker signal and so as I drove there was intermittent audible interference that sounded like a weak FM station when it occasionally fades. The frequency response was somewhat abridged on the Monster unit but it was not very noticeable in the low frequency range and if I hadn't compared it to the iRiver unit, it would have been satisfactory.Obviously, a direct connection between the mp3 player and radio head unit would have sounded much better but if that option isn't available to you, then the iRiver AFT 100 is the next best thing.Note: You really have to experiment with finding unused frequencies on the FM band (they will have a loud hiss) and changing the frequency on the FM transmitter to match them. This process by the way is also easier on the iRiver unit. If you spend some time, you will probably be happy with the results. Don't expect the three preprogrammed settings to work well, in my test all three worked terribly."
1052,"I picked up a tip from a DIY website (I can't remember which one ) on how to make an excellent HDTV antenna at home with an aluminum pie pan and 4 feet of coax cable. Initially I thought it had to be BS, but I have replicated it several times and each time it doubles the number of channels I get.  The cool thing is that if it doesn't work for you, you haven't spent 40 bucks on a useless device.Here are the steps:Using tin snips or very heavy duty scissors, cut the bottom out of an aluminum pie pan.Cut another, offset circle out of the center of the pie pan bottom.  You should now have a crescent shaped  piece of metal with two points that don't touch. (I've also had success using the ""lip"" of the pan that I just cut off.  Just make sure you cut a gap in the circle.Cut the connector off of one end of a coax cable about 4 feet in length. strip about 3 inches off the end of the plastic insulator.  There should be a silver woven wiring around the inner sheath.  Unweave this and  twist it together to make a wire.  strip the inner sheath down to the copper wire.  Separate these two ends and attach each to a tip of the ""crescent.""  Make sure the silver and copper wires don't overlap or touch.Connect the other end of the coax to your digital receiver and either nail the pan to a wall, or drape the antenna and coax over the top of a couple of window  shade or drape rods (that's how I have it)Reset your channels by autotuning (check your manual).Be amazed at the increase in signal strength and quality.If you have questions, post them in this review, or web search DIY digital antenna.  It really works!"
1053,"Easy setup, and good range.However, the unit seems to overheat or, for whatever reason, will stop working without warning once a month or so.  I haven't figured out what causes it, but I have to unplug it for a few minutes and then restart it.Also, the flashing blue lights are INCREDIBLY annoying.  I haven't figured out how to shut them off."
1054,The mic works great but the geniuses at Rode who put all those little rubber bands to keep the mic isolated from noise should have come up with something better.  All my bands are broken and now the mic is covered with gaff tape - and often flops from side to side when shooting.  Not good.
1055,"I've owned this for several years.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes devices attached are recognized, sometimes they're not.  Also, it's not Linux compatible (if you care about such things.)UPDATE:  I bought a D-Link DUB-C2 USB PCMCIA Card 2 x USB 2.0 to replace this, and it works great for me.  A lot of people on Company A gave it poor reviews though, so perhaps this sort of device is kind of hit-and-miss depending on what model of computer and/or software it's used with."
1056,"When I reciebed the E2 as a gift I thought nice, i needed a new one (had my PalmV for 5 years). So after i updated the new Palm I was ready to go.I use mine every day, all day, so it got a work out fom day 1. Now the problems 1st it is slower, 2nd, in the middle of writing it freezes and you have to wait for it to catch up, 3rd you cant read it in the sunlight, 4th The battery does not last as long. All in all it has some better features (MP3, bluetooth) than the others but its not all its advertised to be. Actually starts to make me want to look at other brands for a PDA."
1057,I was dissapointed enough with this product that i returned it back to Company A. In my mind it did not deliver the goods. I found it to be uncomfortable after any sort of prolonged use (and i did try all the different rubber fittings). The bass was weak and in general i thought the sound quality was average. Definately not what i had expected from a product of this price.
1058,"This is a cheap flimsy piece of junk. The signal constantly drops in and out on most channels. It might work if you lived under the transmitters. So would a 3.00 pair of rabbit ears, which I have, and they work about as well as this product. I am less than 25 miles from an area known as Cedar Hill where all the transmitters are located."
1059,"These headphones would have been good except for two things:1. ""ssssssss"" sound problem... (hissing sound - overdrive on anyting ""s"" sounding)2. poor base level3. average on percussionsThe JWIN JHV100 Closed-Type Pro Digital Studio Monitor Headphones (which are mostly given away free) are much better than these headphones."
1060,"Had a previous version MX500 and was very happy for years.  This is pretty much just the same mouse.  Interface used to update the speed is straight forward until you get to the advanced settings, just have to figure it out.  The lemon comes because of the scroll, mine skips.  1 out of 3 scrolls gets picked up and feels more rough than my previous mouse.  I am sure others might be ok but now I have to just live with it or go through the hassle of returning it.  No real impressive gaming differences at all from my MX500.  Playing Medal of Honor made no difference with this new mouse really, for me it was just time for a new one so I purchased this.  If on the fence because you think this will improve gaming don't buy, if you need a new mouse because your old one is shot this is still a great mouse.  I just hope your scroll works better than mine.  Would be better priced at $19.99"
1061,I had a lot of problems getting this unit to work so I ended up giving it away. I would not buy another one.
1062,"The Harmony 880 works in a basic sense, within its limited capacities, once you get through the horrible software. Logitech abuses its customers by forcing them to divulge personal information so they can sell your name on a mailing list.1. The software design is terrible. Every option is hidden in an unintuitive place, and the descriptions of options are confusingly worded. For example, during setup, it kept asking for ""Cable Box Input."" Is it asking a) which input on my TV is connected to the Cable Box or b) which input on the Cable Box receives the cable signal? The software is like this from top to bottom.2. The 880 offers limited control. For example, you cannot change the order in which it turns on components or insert a delay between one device and another. It only allows you to insert delays after it tries to turn everything on at once (and fails). Useless.3. The ""Mute"" and ""Previous Channel"" buttons are narrow, poorly located, and hard to press.4. Logitech forces you to login to their website just to use your remote. Why should I have to divulge personal information to them and create a login just to use something that I own? It's a form of blackmail--they want to make more money by selling your information to other companies and  spamming your e-mail with advertisements. Companies that abuse their customers like this disgust me.I would not buy this product again. I would look for something that is better designed from another company. Since I've spent hours setting it up, however, I will keep it."
1063,"The depth of the deepest part is no deeper than the standard solid lens hood.  Hood cutouts are deeper than the standard solid lens hood, so there is less coverage.It does not fit on the lens reversed."
1064,"At first glance product catches the eye with price. With 4 SATA connectors its ideal for most and mainly reliable til, ur system keeps shutting off and u have no idea y. I purchased about 5 different wattages of this product and all ended with same result, somehow and for some unforeseen reason the fan on PS had lost its blades causing it to overheat, hence the unexpected shutdowns. I keep my system stationary so I have no clue as to how or y the blades broke and the fan dislodged itself but hey, u get what u pay for right. Its cheap, and in my opinion still a good choice for temporary replacement but not good for long-term use. The last 1 barely lasted over a month and here I am replacing the replacement...lol"
1065,The mouse is great but the keyboard is very fragile. It was cheap but I expected something better from Logitech.
1066,"It does what they say: grinds coffee hands-free.  The finest grind really isn't fine enough for me, but I  can just push the button again for regrinding. It's a bit messy to get the ground coffee out, as there isn't a neat dainty spout, but it works and I got excellent coffee from it.  Until today, when it stopped working and just buzzed.  Looked up the warranty, which says ""There is no warranty with respect to the following, which may be supplied with this product, including without limitation: glass parts, glass containers, cutter/strainers, blades, seals, gaskets, clutches, motor brushes, and/or agitators, etc.""  The part that broke connects the motor to the grinding unit, it must be a clutch or maybe an ""etc.""  So I shall have to get another grinder, hopefully a more durable one."
1067,The product arrived with a useless Guide and no Manual . I searched everywhere in MS Web Site but frustratingly found nothing like a User Guide or a Manual. What an inferior product with customizable keys but in nowhere you can find instructions how to customize them
1068,"It does what it's supposed to but it's about as cool as wearing your socks over your jeans.  It's also very clunky and hard to put on and keep on.  But it does do what it's supposed to do and pics turn out nice.Update:  After doing more tests, this thing is useless.  Don't waste your money.  The Gary Fong Puffer might be better from the results I've seen because of the curvature and microbumps."
1069,"I bought this cable to hook up my newly ordered Xbox 360 to my HD TV.  But I later found that the 360 comes with a very similar, if not identical, cable.  Perhaps one is longer?  Perhaps this is an out-dated accessory?  Whatever.  Check your 360 before ordering this cable, or end up feeling dull and foolish like me."
1070,"I have had a lot of problems with this mouse. It will work for a few days, and then will suddenly stop working. Hitting the ""connect"" and ""reset"" buttons on the mouse won't fix the problem - all you can do is reboot. Otherwise it seems to work OK - range is about six feet, and so far battery life looks OK. Still, I would definitely not recommend buying this mouse."
1071,"I love my Palm Treo 650. It's bright and really sharp. That said, I expected nothing less. What I got when I received the Palm TX was a very dull, glary screen that was hard to read in normal office light. I was disappointed to say the least and sent it back about 6 hours later.I've had three Pocket Pcs. My last one from Toshiba was fantastic. Super bright screen that was bigger than the TX and low glare high contrast.  I like the Palm OS better, but will probably go back to a PPC if this is as good as it gets.Mostly, I read ebooks on my PPC and some e-mail. I'm on planes a lot and it's easy to see. This would be very hard to see in a bright and glare-filled room...I'm glad others liked it. Wish it had worked for me."
1072,"Don't buy.  I would have returned this Garmin n&uuml;vi 350 if I bought it from Costco where returns are easy. For about the same price, check out the Magellan Maestro series.  I bought this from Company A because of the 4.5 stars from over 2,000 reviews.Pros:- SmallCons:- Text-to-Speech is lousy.- Occasionally (usually just before destination arrival), the device stops ""directing"".- Routes are not optimal.- MP3 works but why would you want to listen to music through this speaker?I have owned this for over a month now and have done weekly web updates so I should have the latest software.  Again, don't buy."
1073,"Mine came quickly and in good shape.When I use the focus, I can tell that something is happening, but I wouldn't use the word focus.At 100 feet, this monocular becomes ineffective; I couldn't make out the letters on a license plate.At night, it does a decent job of collecting light, but you need to know what you're viewing.Over, I feel this is just an expensive kid's toy."
1074,"To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200."
1075,"A few things about this Amplifier. I knew when I purchased the item that it wouldn't last forever. Look at the cost, and the reviews on the item, and you'll see why. I bought this item in May of 2010. It lasted just over 7 months before it fried. Literally, fried. I didn't abuse the amp, I didn't run it at max power, in fact, I ran it at about 35% power. The power rating is way overshot, and I would suggest that if you do buy this amp, make sure that there is some vent room under it. Also put in some high quality buss fuses in it. Good luck to you if you bought this amp already."
1076,Circumference of this armband is little more than 10 inches long when adjusted. It will probably stretch comfortably to 11 inches. 12 inches should be maximum. It's a little bit too tight for me and I'm not a guy with really bulky arms.
1077,Good sound separation but the base is terrible. Don't waste your money. Bought these as an upgrade to the buds that came with the ipod nano. Turns out original pods were better.
1078,"I'm done with Sony DVD players.  I had the first 5 disc DVD player from Sony and it lasted 2 yrs, then it stopped reading discs.  Great while it lasted but I expect more from Sony especially with the light use the player gets.  But I figured it was a fluke and didn't see many alternatives for the 5 disc type so I bought another one last year.  It's been 14 months and I probably watched 20 DVD's at most, and it just stopped reading movies.  I have a media center PC so I only use this DVD when I have a multipart movie to watch and still it died.  So another black box goes to the landfill.  First one was $170, Second one was $120, now they're about $80... still not worth a year of service."
1079,"For quick and simple picture calibration, this is exactly what it claims to be.  I hope an actual ISF professional would be a bit more involved than this.  It marginally improved my DVD settings, except my problem wasn't with my DVD picture, it was more my satellite I was trying to fix.  But now that I give it some thought, I guess all calibration DVDs are by definition only designed to work with DVD settings.  Glad I didn't spend more than I did on it."
1080,"This is a great camcorder if you are filming sloths with a tripod.  If anything moves, it blurs. The video is noticeably choppy, the stills are blurry.  The sound is questionable. You can't fill up a 1 GB memory card on one set of batteries (about 40 minutes).  From the time you hit the button to take a picture until it actually takes it is at least 3 seconds. It does not remember settings from power off to power on, I had to set the flash to auto repeatedly.It is small, it is light, it will fit in you pocket.  It is actually quite amazing for so small a device.If you are filming for your website, this is cost effective, buy rechargeable batteries.  If you are filming for posterity or a DVD to give grandma, don't bother."
1081,"It got stuck on the filter and took Channel-Locks to get it off.I had lubricated the threads, I was very careful to not jam or cross-thread it, I used every grippy trick I knew or could think of to get enough of friction to unscrew the cursed thing and eventually got out the tools to spin it loose.  Of course that ruined it, and good riddance!Why on earth B&W; left these smooth and didn't think to machine knurling into these rings so we can all get a grip is a mystery.  They really dropped the ball on these.Maybe those specialized, padded, oil-filter removal pliers, might have gotten it off and not destroyed it in the process it, but those are big tools and who's going to carry them into the field?Since I'm not the only one with problems removing the rings, I'll avoid them in the future."

1083,"This hood does not adequately affix to the lens, causing it to move when bumped.  It comes off very easily."
1084,"I ordered one here last month and the price has dropped siginificantly within the same day. I am glad to get the price adjusted immediately after e-mailing the customer service. When the unit arrived, I opened the box, took out the beautiful antenna and hooked it up immediately. I can't believe the RF input port broke when I was connecting the RG-6 cable to it. I got a replacement unit later and the reception is not bad and is better than the RCA ANT1251 within the same price range, nevertheless, another RCA antenna ANT537 gives even better reception at a slight higher cost. The MANT510 antenna comes with a detachable cable and you can use your own cable at desired length, while the RCA ANT537 has only a fixed 6-ft non-detachable cable. Unfortunately, the RF input port of MANT510 is also easily detachable (but not re-attachable). With the lower built quality of this MANT510, I'd rather use a coupler to extend the cable of the better reception ANT537. One nice thing of the Philips MANT510 is the  alternative input port with switch in the back. It allows you to connect to Dish, cable, or another antenna pointing at different direction. Recently, I switched to digital broadcasting using a DTV converter box under the coupon program. This antenna performs well in digital receiving. I am getting all the digital channels within 45 miles. Unlike the analog reception, its digital reception appears slightly better than the other RCA ANT537."
1085,"The Garmin Nuvi 360 is a reasonably priced GPS with decent size with reasonable features for the price. As I searched the internet for a good price, the best price I was able to find at the time was about $150. And to be honest, if I had paid more, I would send it back. For only $150, I will keep it.This is our second GPS, so we have a degree of familiarity with a GPS's in general.Pro'sGreat user interface - easy to program, easy to save locationsBright displayFast responseGood windshield holderUser documentation is mediocreSo far it has determined where it is very quickly.Cons( many more than Pro's)On-Off switch is difficult to use-Basic programming - ie setting the time is not explained in User Guide and can't be programmed manually. You have to register and activate before it will take the time from the PC. But how can a user guide NOT explain how to set the time on a device?- User documentation does not explain that you have to register it before it will activate. If I had by passed the registration step, it would have been a frustrating experience trying to figure out how get to the maps...- Built in speaker volume on maximum is not loud enough. At highway speeds, the device's volume is tad higher than road noise. WHile it does have a connector for external speakers, why would we want external speakers for an after-market item?- Battery charging only occurs when the device is plugged in BUT POWERED OFF. This is not explained in the documentation, making you think the battery doesn't hold a charge.- Navigation- the default voice is very robotic, which is anything but state of the art for gear purchased in 2009- navigation directions around town are fine. However, the directions given for  highway travel are extremely annoying and chatty. Many times when going a distance on a highway, the Garmin does not tell you to go 17 miles on Route 80 for example. Rather, it instructs you to go 2 miles to the next exit and then tells you to stay on the highway. Then it gives instructions to turn at the next exit and tells you to stay on the highway again. It could tell you that have 6 turns before you really come to the turn that will be the exit. Very counter-intuitive. If you had a friend giving directions like that, you would stop the car and  make them get out of the car.- Programming addresses is good with some exceptions. For example, when trying to program 'Mount Arlington', it would NOT accept 'Mount' or 'Arlington'. However, by programming the street address it then shows the choices of towns include 'Mt. Arlington'. So it lacks the fundamental string matching logic to find key words. You just have to learn its eccentricities."
1086,I couldn't get this to work with my phone. Not sure if it is the product or if it is the phone. Hope to get different phone in future. Will try it again with new phone.
1087,"I bought two of these... While the RCA RCD159 is inexpensive and compact, it lacked a feature that drove me crazy. The problem is that when you put a CD in, then press the play button, you have to wait until it reads all the tracks(sometimes 15 seconds for me). After that it displays the number of tracks. Then you must press play a second time to get it to start playing!!!After a few months the player would start showing ERR on the display when I inserted CD's that previously played fine. My other player plays them fine...So could be something with the CD read window/adjustment....The radio is poor quality in the sense that it only picks up a few of the local fm stations(they drown out the rest)... Whereas my truck radio picks  them all up(able to separate them better).Threw the RCA out. My wife still has hers(at work) ...and says it is OK for the price..."
1088,"I have a Mac, and the documentation is definitely Windows-centric. Nevertheless, it has a web browser interface, so I was able to quickly set it up. To keep things simple, I was running my wireless network without any encryption, and the extender worked just fine. Then I turned on WPA, and the extender slowed to a crawl. Very disappointed as I was hoping to extend my network out to our porch.Bottom line: If you want to use WPA (as any person should), do not use this extender."
1089,"Case: made in China case has stiff leather and mine had a strong chemical smell (aniline or a phenol derivative, neither are ""nice chemicals"").Neck Strap: downright silly, unless you are into wearing flashy metal chains. The serrations will dig into neck on warm days after a period of use. Not comfy.Battery: Only thing useful. I should have gotten a spare battery and ordered a nice case somewhere else. There are lots of after market choices."
1090,The wire does not seem thick enough to be 8 gauge. I went with Rockford Fosgate wiring kit. Better quality!
1091,"I was disappointed to find that this kit has only a 3 foot ground cable. The product description is a little  confusing because of the way the lines are split across bullet points... I thought it meant that the fuse holder had 3 ft wires:* 20 Ft. 8 ga red power cable Competition high-quality fuse folder 3 Ft* 8 ga. black ground cable 16 Ft. 18 ga blue turn-on wire 20 FtFortunately, I had some 8 gauge black wire already so I used that - I never use the chassis ground for high current devices, it's better to run both ground and power back to the battery.The wire doesn't seem to be the same size as my existing 8 gauge cable, but it seems thicker than a 10 gauge, but I just ""eyeballed it"", I didn't make any true measurements. The insulation on the wires is thicker than ""normal"" wires so if you're trying to pull the wire through a small hole, that could cause a problem."
1092,Not what I expected. It is around in my office gathering dust!!! might come handy another time. No use for it now.
1093,"I don't know if it is the stove that we have that isn't a standard size, or if these don't fit well because of their strange size.  Also they don't seem to be that sturdy because they are already showing some ware and I have only been using them for about 6 months."
1094,"150 feet of 16-gauge cord?  Are they crazy?  This thing will hold half of that.  Nicely built and inexpensive, but waaay too narrow.  Use it for a 50-feet cord and you'll be happy."
1095,"I really enjoyed this radio for about 10 months until the digital tuner quit working. I can occasionally get it to work by repeatedly pulling and reinserting the two AAA batteries until it responds for a short while before failing again. Other than this showstopper, the radio is fantastic: small, light weight, easy to tune, has five buttons on the top that can be present for three separate bands (two FM and one AM). The ear phone cord is the antenna for the radio and the sound quality and ability to pull in stations is excellent. The volume buttons are located on the face of unit along with buttons for Dynamic Bass Boost (DBB) and adjustable tuning step. I didn't like the comfort of the earbuds that came with the radio and replaced them with Sony earbuds. When turned on: the display shows the station, band, and signal strength. The radio also has a 90-minute turn off timer (that can be turned on and off) which shows on the display. When turned off: the digital display shows a digital clock. The radio has a switch on the back which locks the controls. Based on the reliability problems I have had with my radio, I cannot recommend it."
1096,the headunit sits very far back with this kit and there is a bar in my 2007 honda civic si behind the headunit so i couldn't use this kit. sucks cause i love the quality of their products.
1097,"Unfortunately, this only works a small amount of the time.  I have no idea why it will work one time, then not another."
1098,"I know the rating looks harsh, but I've just spent $240. At that range, the product had better be darn good. This one just isn't.For one, it's heavy and bulky... and on my laptop, it's actually making the screen go down if it's already tilted backwards... that's a bad start. Then, the angle of view is kinda weird. It's good sideways, but up and down, it seems like it's more tilted up?The back stand... these things on the logitech webcams have been driving me crazy. At first, you think they'll be helpful and balance the camera out, but in the end, the slightest thing too close to your laptop screen, and they're falling. They're also god hard to store, which means they easily break, and then, you're out $240, because the webcam can't hook on to anything, or balance.CPU issues... wow this thing sucks the life of my computer!! Everything slows down incredibly when I start chatting. Yeah, I want to chat, but I don't want to stop living and breathing for it!The mic - ok so the other person can see every pimple on your forehead (angle tilted up), but they can't hear you if you step 1 foot diagonally. So your kids can wave to granny, but they won't be able to say a word she can hear until all she can see is their lips... that's just weird.Conclusion: not the bang for the buck."
1099,"Video and audio quality is acceptable.  I didn't find setup terribly difficult.  BUT, the web interface is a major disappointment.  Multiscreen mode only works with Microsoft Internet explorer.  It also doesn't appear to work on my Android device.There are three modes to access the display from your browser: &#34;Active X&#34;, which works most of the time with Internet Explorer, &#34;Java Applet&#34;, which none of my browsers would allow to run due to perceived security issues, and &#34;Image Mode&#34;.If you have it setup to display more than one video source and you access it with Chrome or Firefox, it falls back to this default &#34;Image&#34; mode where the server sends continuous jpg images of the four as fast as it can't...what you see is your browser rapidly flickering through the four sources.What is particularly frustrating is that this is simply a software design issue.  If the manufacturer had spent an extra day getting it right, they'd have a better product for no incremental cost."
1100,Most of the CDs in 1 of the 100 pack spindles I received a week ago have long scratches or weird spots on the recording side. I have to check each cd carefully before use as these are used for professional purposes
1101,"stooped working, in the trashed A week or two ago, not happy, not happy, waste of time. apple two in to the"
1102,I bought this to hook up my ipod to my car. The connection wasn't sturdy so if the wire moved at all (which tends to happen in a moving car) the speakers on one side would go out. It wasn't consistently the right or left speakers. The cable would most likely work fine for a stationary at-home stereo but not in a car. I returned mine but am still waiting on a refund.
1103,I was very disappointed with these earbuds.  The cord was stiff and heavy so the earbuds did not stay in my ears at all.  Also I started have trouble with the sound cutting out after about a month of use compared to my last pair from a different company which lasted over a year of heavy use.
1104,"short cord, trebly, hearing-reducing sound, and an ever-breaking, annoying unraveling thin cord that will drive most men insane.  Maybe all ear buds suck like this except sony.I guess I had no idea how great sony was until I had to buy some replacements.  Some complain about sony's ergonomic design and comfort.  These people are mostly uncivilized fools who don't understand how anything works and with no functioning nerve endings.  If you like ear buds for music rather than the constant annoying distraction of their existence I'd recommend those, not that I have any but the old ones I broke and are no longer made.Otherwise, silence or background noise is far preferable than these phone's tendency to constantly remind you that you are wearing them and you wasted your money on them.I think J stands for junior, so this is fine for kids who don't know any better and have no money and hear too well as it is, but not really good for you.  You deserve better than that.The fit is fine."
1105,"In two different use cases the computer noticed a monitor was connected, and even detected its resolution, but the picture was always black.  Defective or misdesigned?  Or am I just using it wrong?  I really don't know.  I guess I never will."
1106,"I purchased this monitor to be my primary monitor and replace a Sony Trinitron monitor. The performance is quite disappointing from a number of perspectives. First, the color fidelity is not good at all. I calibrated the display several times, to no avail: color shift is very noticeable and white is just about impossible to achieve. Second, the viewing angle is very very narrow, even a slight shift off axis and there is profound color shift and luminance drop off. Third, the luminance is very uneven top to bottom. Fourth, there is an advertising sticker that covers the top edge of the surround, no luck at all getting the gummy backing off of the monitor. Fifth, it really needs to be adjustable vertically, but the stand only tilts, there is no horizontal adjustment.This is such a disappointing product that I moved it to storage for several months, I'm using it now in a application where image color quality doesn't matter. The only upside to this unit is the size of the display. Given its price, I think it would be easy to find a better monitor elsewhere."
1107,"I purchased this for use in my car. I had planned on keeping my iPod in the glove compartment, and use this remote attached to the steering wheel to control it. This turned out to be almost impossible. The remote only works reliably around 2 ft away from the ipod, any further away and it will start ""missing"" commands.On the bright side, it was very easy to attach to the steering wheel."
1108,"This is a really great remote, once you get it configured.  It's extremely flexible and allows you to control so much more than regular universal remotes.  You can control things like IR light switches, ceiling fans, satellite radios, Windows Media Center PCs, video game consoles and more.  And more impressively, you can chain commands together so pressing one button, for instance, draws the blinds, turns down the lights, turns on your TV and switches it to the correct input, turns on your stereo system, and starts up a DVD.  Any functions on the factory remote that aren't available as hardware buttons can be programmed to a menu displayed on the remote's LCD screen.  You can also adjust the backlighting on the remote, a feature I really like.The problem, however, is with the configuration software.  It is excruciating to use.  There are a number of bugs in the current version (7.5), such as being unable to change the Activity Buttons on the remote.  The software's tip center mentions that there is a button to rearrange items in the remote's menu, but that button doesn't actually exist!  The software could not identify the portable TV that I use in my bedroom (it thought I had a totally different 27"" model) and I had to make it ""learn"" the commands just like a cheap $20 remote.  It had difficulty with my satellite radio; many of the remote functions were not configured by default and I had to select to ""play FM radio"" rather than just ""play music"" to get it to work properly.  The wording in some places is confusing (""Review the settings"" and ""Change Options"" are right next to each other and do two totally different things), and it's often difficult or impossible to back out of a particular menu if it turns out you selected the wrong option.  It also takes an obscene number of mouse clicks to make even minor changes.  For instance, to tweak the timing of one particular command sequence required more than 30 clicks, to change just one numeric value.  You also must have an active Internet connection to setup the remote.  That's easy if you have cable or DSL, not so easy if you're on dialup or your ISP just went down.  Most annoying of all is that you can only have one remote.  If you have more than one to control different devices, say, one for the living room and one for the bedroom, you have to create a separate account, with separate username and password, for each remote.  And you MUST register with Logitech and create an account to use the remote, there's really no way out of it.If you have a fairly normal electronics setup, or don't have the patience of Job, stick to a regular universal remote and keep away from the Harmony series.  I'd only bother with a Harmony remote if you have an unusual equipment setup that a regular remote can't handle AND you have several hours to throw away."
1109,"Even though this case showed up as a recommended accessory when I purchased a new Garmin 1390LMT, it was a VERY tight fit.  I would not recommend this case for any newer 4.3"" models.  At least it was cheap, because it won't get much use.  Of course, that could be why is is so inexpensive - there are few models it will actually fit..."
1110,"I got this after winning the Zune in a promo from Microsoft. The Zune is great, but I have encounter the same problems as others.. For one, positioning is everything, I have to rest mine under my dash near my gear stick to get a clear signal. Two, the charger has to be plugged into too to get a very clear signal - totally [..] for me. Three - the sound quality just isnt that good. I don't aspect CD quality like someone said, but to be that close to your antenna and have it sound muffle is crazy. I'm going to purchase the monster version, I was orginally but they didnt have it in stock. Monster is kown for good audio products and I'm guessing it will out perform this ok, but very unsatifactorty product"
1111,"This was exciting. The retractable cord albeit a little short to hit your nightstand from most wall outlet locations in hotels has a great retracting spring to help you wrap things up quickly. However, the AC adapter i received must be faulty. I plugged in overnight, and while it showed :Charging"" it didnt actually charge. I tried in 2 hotels and 3 airports, all the same. I kept it anyways simply because i liked the retractable USB dongle and I used an apple charger with it, but overall it just didnt work for me.Cable, while cheap and i doubt it would last daily use, works for now.AC adapter, nope.DC adapter. Psh, who needs this? Thrown in for the sake of having it. Very few do not have an ipod adapter in car already, and if youre buying this to be used in car, dont. thin cables just arent good for being repeatedly pinched and abused in a car enviroment"
1112,I had high hopes but they did not pan out.  Like the price and features.  I have used several other FM transmitters with better results.  I could not get a clear signal. I always had break thru music/ static from the original station broadcast.  Great Company A service as they took it back pre-paid shipping.
1113,I like to give myself a short buzz every once in awhile to save some money on going to a barber for such a simple trim. First use - worked fine. I was washing my face and accidentally splashed a little water on the unit (it was closer than I thought). I quickly dried it off.  The next night I was brushing my teeth and I looked at it and saw some orange in the blade area. I looked closer and it was rust. AND A LOT OF IT! I'd say about 60% of it now is orange. I've had previous Wahl products last much longer before the rust showed up. This is pretty disappointing.(here comes the generic answer from their customer server rep)
1114,"Prior to buying the Touch i used the Nano for music and my PSP for games, photos, and movies.  When the touch came out i was excited.  What a disappointment!! Photos and video are not even close to the PSP.  If you enlarge a picture on the touch it will show noise.  On the PSP i can enlarge any photo and still get clear pictures.  I suspect it is because the touch ""optimizes"" the photos.  It also cannot read PDF files and you cannot set your appointments manually (what a waste). This is really no more than a bigger music IPOD. I suspect the only people who will like this are fanboys of apple or have never seen or used a PSP. Overall this is a real ripoff for $400.00.  I will stick with my PSP until apple can compare in the video and photo dept."
1115,"after placing equiptment in case,closing,noticed later back panel poped out.I epoxided and is holding.I had purchased from 47th street before,different model,it was much better.I noticed also the model just recieved is not the same as I thought I purchsed.The joining edges are much more narrow compared to the case shown."
1116,"It simply doesn't work. The majority of the time I use it, windows will say ""USB Device has malfunctioned"". If I switch back and fourth enough times it eventually goes through, but it is incredibly annoying.You should probably get a hardware switch, instead of a software switch like this."
1117,"OK, it isn't really the print server's fault, or Linksys.  Just not compatible with anything but the latest multifunction printers that follow some kind of announcement protocol to identify themselves on USB.I had to reflash the access point just to connect to this thing - that was some work, let me tell you.  Make sure you write down ALL the settings before doing that!Linksys phone support was unhelpful, but their web chat support (IE only) was great, and worked the problem with me until there was really nothing left to try."
1118,"Now, this remote is a great idea.  The PS3 is a great DVD/Blu-Ray player and an easy to use remote is a perfect addition.This remote works as any others.  Its pretty simple to use everything's great but there's just one negative.The remote is bluetooth.  Initially, I thought ""Wow, Great!  Its bluetooth!"".  That is until I started using it.  The problem is the remote turns the PS3 on with a push of any button on the remote.  At first, I thought, meh, I'll just turn it off.  But if your remote tends to move around, like when you go through your pile of remotes, usually a button is actually pushed.  Well, that just turned on your PS3.  Sometimes my PS3 has stayed on for a couple days.Now back in the days where your game console didn't run very hot, it might not be as big of an issue.  But these new consoles do run hot (well  maybe not the Wii) and I can't help but imagine what its doing to the console...I really wish Sony would fix this problem.  I wonder if they even see it as a problem.  Maybe they could put a on/off button on it.Bottom line, you're probably better off learning to use the PS3 controller."
1119,"I bought this to upgrade from a 5 megapixel CyberShot, which, over the course of three years had started to take degraded photos from dust getting inside the case and in the lens barrel. I took it apart once last year to clean it out, and it helped marginally, but then after taking it apart again prior to buying the DSC-T100, I managed to not reassemble it correctly, therefore breaking it.The DSC-T100 has an 8 megapixel sensor and apparently ""super steady shot."" Neither of these things seem to matter though, because the camera took crap photos. What good is an 8 megapixel photo when, even shrunk down, it looks blurry and hazy? In addition, why didn't the ""super steady shot"" kick in to fix this? Even in standard daylight, albeit indoors, some photos would turn out blurry. This was unacceptable. Even my old Sony 3 megapixel CyberShot (prior to the 5 and then this model) took crisper pictures than this.Another big problem I had with this camera was its interface design. On my previous two CyberShots, there was a function wheel that you could slide between modes very quickly with. Okay, I'm in auto picture mode, and now I want to take a video. Let's slide the wheel.Here? Okay, let's hit the menu button, which brings up a stuipid PSP style interface, hit down twice to move to movie mode, and then click OK! Yeah, that's really a step forward in interface design.These two things essentially killed the camera for me, and I returned it to Company A.On the plus side, I LOVE the movie modes on the Sony cameras, which is why this was my third CyberShot. 30fps, 640x480 standard MPEG looks great, and with the DSC-T100 they added the ability to zoom.Oh yeah, the camera is also prohibitively small. Now, I wouldn't say I have huge hands or anything, but holding the camera, I noticed that my hand would cover the lens a bit at times forcing me to reposition it. So the lens is placed awkwardly here.Stay away from the DSC-T100.My quest for a new Sony camera continues, because I already have a bunch of Memory Stick Pro media, and because I love the movie modes on these cameras. But the DSC-T100's photo quality sucks, as does the interface."
1120,"Be aware that while this is a notebook charger, it is not necessarily a netbook charger. The notebook charger also comes in a 90W version, whereas this is 70W. They seem to sell another version for netbooks that comes with a car charger. If it is universal, I don't see why one unit can't be made to charge most types of laptops. Regardless of which version you select, it is difficult to determine whether these chargers will work properly on your laptop. Sure, there is the list of models on the Company A listing, but this information is somehow absent from the manufacturers website.Thankfully this unit charges my Midnight Company B and my Lenovo S10 netbook (which was surprising since the connector tip looks different, but it fits). Unfortunately, it doesn't work properly with my friend's Midnight Company C - the laptop states that it is plugged in, but there doesn't seem to be enough juice to charge the battery.The unit isn't much smaller than the Midnight chargers, and is actually more bulky than the one for the netbook.  It also has moving parts to break and tips to lose. The cord unwind/wind mechanism isn't very smooth and the cord has bunched up on rewind several times. One of the cords is also surprisingly thin. The overall construction is on the flimsy side and I really don't expect it last very long."
1121,"I bought this card to use with an Olympus 720sw camera. Nothing in the information here at Company A indicated that the card could not be used in any camera that takes xD cards. However, when this xD card arrived, the blister-pack contained documentation that explicitly named which Fuji cameras could use and which could not, and also said to check with other cameras' manufacturers to determine whether it would work. When I formatted it in the Oly 720sw, it would not work. The camera went through the formatting process, after which the screen went back to a live view for a second, and then the screen showed a menu with 2 choices: power down the camera or format the card. I formatted it again; same thing. I turned off the camera and removed the card. I turned on the camera and it worked fine. I turned it off and inserted an Olympus xD card; it worked fine. I turned it off and put the Fuji card back in. Same menu: power down or format. I decided to try the Fuji card in an older Olympus, my D580. That camera is perfectly happy with the Fuji card, and has no problem formatting it. I took the newly formatted Fuji card and put it back in the 720sw, where it now works fine.So as long as I never format the card in the 720 -- or hang onto the 580 to use for just that purpose -- I guess it will work. But who wants to carry around a second camera just to format the media, or delete several hundred pictures one at a time so as not to have the card glitch out?"
1122,I ordered two of these and they looked nothing like the picture showed them. They arrived as plastic adapters which I wanted to avoid. The picture shows them as metal. I am not satisfied with the purchase.I have uploaded a customer picture that I took to show what the actual product looks like.
1123,"This is one of the riskiest products on the market today.I will admit, the scope does a great job of letting you see the dust that is on your sensor (I use a Canon 5D) but the cleaning materials leave a lot to be desired. Do yourself a favor and let your camera manufacturer clean your sensor for you. No stress and guaranteed workmanship.I saw a few specks of dust that hampered a few of my shots. But after using the cleaning swabs and liquid, even after drying, the streaks were very visible, and I dare to say the sensor has microscopic abrasions on it.Please, if you love your equipment, save your cash and go with the manufacturers."
1124,"I'd also heard good stuff about Buffalo, but this model seems like kind of a dog.  I'll second that when you've got it media-serving (DLNA), the hard disk is constantly whirring.  There are some kinks in its ability to do Mac file-sharing, mostly around its inability to properly do security settings between users.  Using it for home networking, and if I accessed stuff through Apple protocols and family members used different usernames, there was no way to both have access to the the same things.  Ended up using its SMB protocols, but the tech support said they'd look into this and release a firmware update.  That was almost a year ago, no firmware updates since then.  It's a little pokey for having an gigabit ethernet port."
1125,"I purchased this Sony SRF-S84 radio for one purpose only and that is to get one AM talk show. Even though AM is mono, I liked the fact I could get sound in both ear buds and the size was perfect. I read in one review that it was difficult at first to dial in a radio station. I figured I could get use to it as the one man did. Not yet. The radio works ok outside as long as you don't turn your head. The signal drops out. One of the stations this talk show is broadcast on is located in the city I live and still the reception drops out every time I turn or turn my head. I have tried to find the one sweet spot to keep the station in tune, but I have not found it yet or it does not exist. Once I enter a building, the reception is almost nothing and a lot of static back round noise. Sorry I spent the money on this radio. The 12 dollar Sony ICF-S10MK2 I purchased at the same time works much better, but the size makes it a little more difficult to carry while I work. Can't really say anything about the battery life because I have not been able to use it that much. But so far, still using the first battery."
1126,"I just can't give this thing a very good review. I have this in my Windows 7 computer downstairs while my wifi router is upstairs. I can just barely get enough signal to check my email. Forget about streaming video. The problem is, when I set my Toshiba laptop next to the computer with this adapter, the laptop seems to get a moderately strong signal and works for streaming video. That tells me the problem is with this adapter."
1127,"This is my first time getting a personal GPS - my car has a built in GPS system (Toyota).  So saying that, I based a lot of my opinion on what I am able to do with my built in GPS.First, one of the biggest things I hated about this unit was the ability to navigate the map around.  The only option is to scroll out - which doesn't give you the detail you may want.  I use this function a lot if I am trying to see if a smaller street is a better detour to get around traffic.The other thing I really, really hated is that the maps are very, very outdated.  My home development was built in 2005 and it doesn't even show these!  So if you are in a new development, forget it on this."
1128,"The suction cup on my unit has a basically unremoveable protective plastic film.  I've been trying to get it off for a couple of days and I've had limited success.If I can't get it off with some goo gone tonight, I'm done with this thing."
1129,"My husband just bought this to replace the 7-inch Coby player he bought me many years ago.  He got this one because of the bigger screen.I find the sound to be pretty decent but I don't care for the picture.  It's not very sharp and it seems to cut a little off the top of the picture.  For example, I'm used to seeing someone's entire head but with this player their head is either at the very top of the screen or the top of their head is gone.We'll probably return it and get something with a better picture."
1130,"In a list of Company A's best-selling iPod speaker docks, the IM600 is listed first, followed by the less expensive iRhythms (from Cyber Acoustics) and Athena iVoice. I was initially impressed by the IM600's ability to play several different iPods, as Altec's website claims it will do. However, when I installed a Touch 2nd gen, it gave me a ""will not charge this device"" warning. Moreover, it soon stopped playing any iPod! In the instructions, the 16th troubleshooting symptom is ""erratic or irresponsible behavior."" Altec's suggested fix is to ""disconnect the rechargeable battery per instructions in the Power Section."" The full extent of the instructions in the Power section is: ""Remove the rechargeable battery compartment cover by removing the 2 screws."" The screws are tiny, easily missed, and deserve fuller explanation and illustration. In any case, the fix restored iPod Mode to operability (but for how long?). Moreover, Altec's failure to label each of the adapter/inserts for its intended iPod model (the only iPod speaker-dock I've seen that doesn't do so) required more trial and error experimentation (the inserts are so similar it's impossible to be certain that you've selected the right one).If you can do without a radio (and the Altec's FM sensitivity, even with the rod antenna, is pretty weak), your better bet is the highly portable and dependable iRhythms (for under 40 bucks and with audio that's competitive) and/or the Athena iVoice (not portable, but it sounds twice as good as the Altec--and it charges the new Touch.) Altec's service and attention to detail both leave much to be desired. In fact, I'd have to rate the JBL Micro above it after my recent experience.]Original review:As a recent collector-hobbyist in the fascinating world of miniature audio reproduction, I simply had to get my hands on the unit which, in terms of consumer popularity and critical acclaim, is the reigning champion: the Altec Lansing IM600 system. As the rating of 4 stars may reflect, my experience is one of slight anticlimax if not mild disappointment.Had I not picked up an Athena iVoice (currently in short supply, possibly no longer in production), I have little doubt that the rating for the Altec would be five stars. The Athena, described by one professional reviewer as a poor man's version of the Bose Sound Dock, may in fact be better. What is most striking about the Athena--and this is not so much a subjective impression as an irrefutable acoustic ""fact""--is its fullness and solid, ""substantial"" bass. I'm far less bass-conscious than most of today's younger listeners, but when a recording features skillful reproduction of an acoustic double bass played by a master musician, I want to hear it. The Athena picks up the entire unwieldy instrument and transports it to the listener's acoustic space; by contrast, the instrument practically vanishes in the Altec's much more restrictive sonic field. (For an even more convincing demonstration, try the comparison using a well-recorded Hammond B3 organ.)Now for the bright side. The Altec has brilliant treble, reproducing with verisimilitude the sonorities of a grand piano's upper register as well as a percussionist's entire kit--crash cymbal, ride cymbal, hi-hat, snares, brush work--it's all easily picked out by the attentive listener. The Altec also has a more fully-functioned remote than the Athena. Moreover, the sound expander (SFX) makes a more striking difference on this system than is usually the case, not merely dispersing the sound but exposing and highlighting individual instruments in the mix--no doubt the effect is sufficiently stunning to cause some listeners to forgive, or overlook, the deficiencies in the bass frequencies. (It's with a bit of incredulity each time when I look up to trace the panoramic sound source and see nothing larger than a small rectangular purse.)The FM radio reception is adequate but not remarkable. Even with the antenna fully extended I'm getting static and air ""noise"" on stations that my Tivoli Model One pulls in non-problematically with its little pigtail. The alarm will not satisfy those looking for a system with ramping, two-alarm, multiple-schedule possibilities. It works in tandem with the iPod's alarm system to get the job done. The power adapter is of moderate size and weight (the Athena follows the commendable practice of eliminating the wall wart altogether, incorporating it inside the speaker cabinet). A rechargeable battery is frequently omitted on a unit with this much power; Altec's inclusion of it optimizes the practicality of the unit's compact size and light weight. Altec has also thoughtfully(?) provided an extra out jack, should you wish to boost the bass by purchasing an optional sub-woofer from Altec (Tivoli does the same, and I for one refuse to take the bait). The instructions are small in print size and sparse in explanation. (Take your time with things like selecting the right adapter for your iPod and installing the CR remote battery correctly, because some of these plastic pieces are fragile and easily cracked.)In sum, the Altec Lansing reminds me of the treblish James B. Lansing (JBL) systems. And even though it doesn't ""reconstruct"" the sound of a bass, it has none of the distortion that I've occasionally heard from smaller speakers, such as the JBL Micro. If I were spending a week in a cabin with an iPod, my preference would be a collection consisting of an Athena iVoice (for vitamin-fortified, full-frequencied sound); a Tivoli iPal (for its expertly-tuned sound and unequaled FM reception); a JBL On Stage Micro or Cyber Acoustics 421 (for carrying the music into the neighbor's cabin or on a fishing expedition); a Saitek-100 Portable System (for sticking in my pocket while hiking). If packing all four would seem extravagant, there's option #5: the Altec IM600, which is versatile yet highly competent in all that it does. That virtuosity, plus its current price on Company A, makes more than understandable its present position as the people's choice. As a special bonus, the Altec IM600 is the first dock connector I've tried (after 5-6 others) that would charge my 5-year-old 10 gig Ipod, which is not supposed to work with a dock connector."
1131,"My title should say it all: &#34;Sounds good until it stops working and you get it repaired and then sounds good again until it stops working again&#34; but I'll elaborate a little.I got this to go under the seat in my SUV to augment the system. I didn't want to get a sub that was going to take up space and I'm not a 20 year old so I don't need the whole world to know what I'm listening to. If I want super high volume or fidelity I'll use my stereo in my house. Anyway, this seem to fit the bill. Small enough and definitely a good price. It sounds pretty good and make the entire system sound much better. But it stopped working after a bit and I sent of for a repair that was just about half the price of a new one. Anyway, that seem to work fine for about a year until it just died again. The last bass note this ever played was the thud it made when it hit the bottom of the trashcan. Too bad..."
1132,"I returned this monitor due to the viewing angle problem -- on a solid color screen, the color you observe at the top of the monitor will NOT be the same as the color at the bottom...  unless you are at a significant distance from the monitor.  I tend to work about 18"" from my monitor, and the colors are awful.  This cannot be tuned or adjusted -- it's just the way TFT monitors are especially at large sizes.  Quit being impressed with response time, and take a look at the colors."
1133,This lightweight poorly constructed cable is so so at best. Lots of signal loss and doesn't shield EMI/RF very well. Picks up stray electrical pulses pretty easily. Also had to crimp the RCA connectors to keep them in place. Spring for a few extra bucks and get a decent cable. You get what you pay for.
1134,I got this for my guitar and found the fiber to be more coarse than expected.  I would not use on anything with a delicate surface as you may end up with swirls.
1135,"I thought this would be a great bargain but I am disappointed with the sound quality. I've always bought in-ear monitors, and out of 8 different sets I have owned, this one has the least bass. The highs and mids are clean, but the bottom end is missing entirely. I have let them play at high volume for several days to see if that would improve the sound (as suggested by other reviews), but it did not. I used the several different types of ear pieces included, and I have also tried using ear pieces from other headphones. Still the bottom end of the sound spectrum is missing.I cannot recommend these.I ended up getting Klipsch S4 and am very happy with the sound quality."
1136,"I recieved these headphones today and I must say they do not seem to be worth the $240 I paid for them.Pros: -They are packaged nicely-Constructed well-Look Great-Talk Through Button is a great feature-Decent sound quality, although unbalanced between left and right earCons: -Cans are huge and it is very hard to get them to fit properly even with my large head and ears-Noise cancelling is not nearly as good as Bose QC15 or Panasonic RP-HC500-Case is a little small, takes some time to get them folded down and to fit properly in the case-Picks up interference from nearby electronics with noise cancelling turned on causing an oscillating soundI had a pair of Panasonic RP-HC500 which I purchased for $120 just over a year ago. They had excellent noise cancelling ability and decent sound quality for just over $100. While on business travel I left them on the airplane back in September. They have since been discontinued in the United States so I read all the reviews and did some research to find a new pair.I did like the Bose QC15s when I tried them, but thought $300 was a little steep and alot of reviews stated they were a little fragile. I found the Sennheiser PXC 450s on Company A for $240 and the reviews were good so I gave them a shot, but I should have just spent the $300 on the Bose. I did like Sennheiser's talk through feature, but how much am I really going to use it anyway? The Audio Technica ATHANC7B were also a consideration, but with all the negative reviews about the sound leakage I decided against them. Being on an airplane and in office settings would not be the ideal for a pair of headphones leaking sound.Overall the Sennheisers were definetely not worth money, perhaps theSennheiser PXC 350 Active Noise Cancellation Headphone (Black)would be a better option if you are dead set on Sennheisers as the sound quality was decent. No talk through button, but from what I have read pretty much the same headsets. Consider theAudio Technica ATH-ANC7B Active Noise-Cancelling Closed-Back Headphonesif you can deal with the noise leakage. The Bose are nice, but at $300 dollars I feel the Panasonic RP-HC500s are comparable and for less than half the price.I have found the Panasonic RP-HC500s on another website and have already purchased them. They are coming from the United Kingdom, but it will be worth the wait and an overall better noise cancelling headphone for $100 less than the Sennheiser."
1137,"If you want a decent headset but do not need a microphone go ahead and get this one. Just do not expect the microphone to work. Don't believe me? Go look at creatives own forums and select headsets. There are many people not happy with this product. And what is worse, creative will not respond to any of the problems. I have been trying to contact creative for a week now with my problem with NO response. There is NO phone number to call, you have to rely on email only.Stay away from this if you need a microphone."

1140,"For reference speakers, these sound very good for the price. You won't find any cheaper. But buyer beware. First off I had to send them back when I first bought them because of an issue with the headphone jack not silencing the speakers. Then they worked like a charm for about one year. Now only one of the speakers works. Guess what M-Audios warranty is for? That's right, one year. That means they only expect their product will last that long. If I had to do it again, I would save up and buy a real set of monitors. What a shame. Because speakers are so simple- they can potentially last forever just about. Maybe M-Audio designs them to fail, hoping you will buy another pair. Bottom line is, don't waste your money. I also own a pair of the AV40s and I am waiting for them to fail. I own a very expensive M-Audio sound card as well and it has failed. I will be passing on this company in the future."
1141,"This second Belkin usb 2.0 powered hub I bought, I never could get more than three devices to be recognized at once, just like the first Belkin hub.  I figured it was my computer, and put up with it for quite awhile.  One day I'm thinking about usb hubs and started reading Company A reviews.  It hit me that maybe the power supply to the Belkin hubs just wasn't adequate - I read that somewhere.  I ordered a highly rated and inexpensive hub from the Cyberguys.  And everything works, all seven ports all at the same time, and it doesn't seem to care what is plugged in.  Never another Belkin for me."

SO, i would recommend purchasing a key with a REAL software suite, like logitech or ms.  the key is fine.  just NEVER upgrade the software, ONLY use the cd it comes with, and if it doesnt work, get ready to plunk down more $$ for the updated software..."
1144,"I used this to mount an Optoma HD20 projector to the ceiling in my basement.  It should have taken about 30 minutes, but ended up taking a few hours.First, there are absolutely no instructions.  I would never have figured out to reverse the bottom plate pieces to make it fit a 3-hole projector if I hadn't read it in earlier reviews on Company A.  So expect no help - even advice that would be standard across all projectors is not discussed (like how installing the top plate impacts whether or not you can adjust the projector vertically or horizontally).  You will end up installing, uninstalling, installing, uninstalling multiple times.Second, since this is a universal mount, it has a lot of compromises. Depending on where the projector screw holes are, you might not get the mount in the center of your projector.  Make sure you take that into account when deciding where to put it - the offset could mean you no longer are centered for where you plan to put your screen.Third, if you want to mount the projector fairly close to the ceiling, don't get this mount.  The minimum distance from the ceiling is about 6"" - that was too much for me, so I had to modify the mount to work with my application.If I could do it again, I would spend more and get a mount specifically made for my projector.On the plus side, this mount is pretty solid, and now that I finally have it installed, I feel that it is sturdy.  I would not recommend it for the Optoma HD20, though -  getting the mount legs to align properly on the projector is difficult."
1145,"First, the good part. It installs easily, and works right away. So, if you want a cheap enclosure for a drive that you want to salvage form that old computer that you are about to throw away - it maybe exactly what you are looking for.Now, for the disappointments. The biggest one is that it intermittently disconnects and reconnects - every 5-10 minutes. Often in the middle of I/O operations. Even during windows backup I hear click (off) and a few seconds later click again (on). Windows backup reports ""backup couldn't complete. Write error"". Usually, after 10-15GB of writing. Once it ran all the way to 80GB; but I was never able to finish the backup.Among smaller annoyances:The light only indicates that it is plugged in - not whether it's on or off. weird. Also, it is in the back - it's hard to see in typical setup. But since it's useless - it doesn't matter where it is.The cable is A-A, so if you lose it (or if the one that comes with it is two short) - it's not easy to grab a more typical A-B. Although if you need to buy one - the cost of A-A and A-B is about the same.Windows reports that I am plugging it into USB 1.1 port and that I can benefit from using USB 2.0. No other USB device plugged into this port produces this message (other USB drive, WebCam, USB mouse - nothing).Support is atrocious. First few emails got auto-generated response; then the live person came on, and blamed motherboard, USB drivers, Windows, California fires, but wasn't even considering troubleshooting the enclosure itself. Well, I guess for under $20 it's a gamble."
1146,"This Zen locks up all the time.  It freezes up a few times a day when listening to an audio book.  I keep a paper clip handy to push the little reset button which is the only way to knock it loose.  Nothing quality about the build or feel.  Feels like a 12.99 kid's toy.  I wanted to like it, but  just can't seem to find a very good reason."
1147,"I know this turntable is cheap, but the quality it is definitely off. The needle broke of since like 4 months of use, and I don't use it very often, the cover fell off the first time I opened it. I didn't returned it, only because I am in Mexico, otherwise, I would like my dollars back."
1148,"Pros:*Easily the most inexpensive HR monitor that transmits workout data to computer.*Very comfortable as a casual watch -- very light, great band.*Great display - easy to read.*Easy to use.Cons:*HR signal is not compatible with fitness equipment (doesn't send live signal to elliptical/stairmaster/treadmill), like Polar and Nike are.*Once the battery dies, you are in trouble. Took to jeweler as recommended in manual, but they wouldn't touch it because they didn't sell that model.  They said they could send it off, but would cost appx $25 (for a $50 watch???).  Replaced the battery myself, but you cannot do this without breaking a plastic covering inside.  Since replacing the battery, I got it to work for a day, but it has since shut down.  By taking it apart and putting back together (not as easy as it sounds), I'm able to make functional for about an hour before it goes out again.  This is after using this for about 6 months."
1149,"I received this unit as a gift and was really excited. It had all the features I wanted such as street to text, route detour and millions of POIs. After using this unit, reality set in and eventually I had to return the unit. Props to Company A with a no hassle return.Here is my experience.Pros...Came with a protective caseHad millions of POIsCorrectly spoke the street namesGreat to get you to places you haven't been beforeAllows users to bypass or detour around roads. This part is great and would be better if you could program the unit always skip a certain road. Currently, it only allows the detour on the current route and doesn't save the detour for future trips.Clear bright screenSuction cup and mounting unit worked wellCould receive traffic reports (And yearly subscription was $20 or less.. I have forgotten the exact amount)Locked on signals very quicklyWasn't loaded down with extras that I wouldn't use such as audio readers, tip calculators, etc.Cons...The screen would randomly change from map to driving directions without anyone touching the screenWhen selecting the fastest time, it would route us next to interstates but not on them thus making us hit many many stop lights. Getting on the interstate would cause it to recalculate and then it would behave.We were driving home from a trip, when the fastest route was selected, it estimated the arrival time as 5:46 pm. When the shortest distance was selected, the arrival time would change to 4:06pm. The time difference was from it trying to make us drive through the city on surface streets instead of using the interstate which was almost totally empty.Sometimes on short trips, if we deviated from course, it would take as long as 30 seconds to recalculate, thus causing us to miss the next turnoff and recalculate again.When using the detour function, finding the correct street to route around was trial and error.When using the detour function, the unit would ""panic"" when we told it we didn't want a certain off ramp and would try to have us get off the interstate 8 miles too early and drive through the city. (We just wanted to get off one ramp earlier, not five off ramps)The screen seemed to forget it was a touch screen and would require repeated touches to use. (up to 6 times)The suction cup on the mount only has a little rubber tab to pull allowing it to detach from the windshield. It's durability might be questionable and if it broke, getting it off the windshield would be a pain.The breaking point was when it would try to route us through downtown areas instead of using the interstates when selecting fastest time. I checked every time and there weren't any traffic issues on the interestate, but the unit seemed to have a fondness for stop lights."
1150,"I ordered 3 of these as I go through mini mice fairly quickly due to failure, abuse, loss etc.  One was dead out of the box, the other 2 are working fine so far.  They seem to be of typical quality, and I have no issues with pointing resolution or glitchyness as reported elsewhere."
1151,"When people that review this product tell you it is a good buy for the money, I have to say NOT! This is the cheapest looking Plantronics headset I have ever purchased. The entire thing is made of plastic with some parts painted silver. It looks like something I'd buy off the street for ten dollars in any large city. I have been buying Plantronics for years because of the fact they worked with NASA on space missions and they know how to build a good headset. That said this is a cheap headset. Furthermore mine did not work very well at all.  I got a great deal of static trying to use TeamSpeak while gaming. In fact I put my dirty old behind the head Plantronics headset back on after trying this one. The picture here is not the headset you will receive. It has a wider over the head and  boom mic piece. I can't in good conscience recommend this Plantronics headset unless you are so broke you can't afford a better one. As for myself I'm going to spend more to buy a truly decent headset and donate this one to charity. I decided to give Sennheiser's headset a try so I wlll let you know how it works out.CA Luster"

1154,"I'm writing this review late.  I bought these headphones last year (2010) because my current ones were dying.  When I got them, I tried them out and immediately put them in my desk and went back to using my dying headphones.  Soon after I bought a new pair of Koss headphones.  My Koss have just died this morning, on the 1 hour bus ride to work, and I had to listen to several loud cell phone conversations instead of music on my iPod.  I pulled the Skullcandy headphones out of my desk drawer and tried them again.  They sound tinny, the volume isn't great and they're bulkier than what I usually buy.  I plan on using them until tomorrow when I can get to a decent store and buy a new pair.The fit is only okay but I know they'll be sliding off my head as soon as I try to walk with them.  I wish headphone companies wouldn't make the smallest fit so large."
1155,"I purchased this mount to use for our 65"" Sharp LCD and for our 70"" Sharp LED LCD. I tried hanging both of these TV's the the mount was nearly impossible to move with the TVs on the wall.

Instead, spend the extra money and get a:[...]Normally Cheetah makes great mounts, and I had been very happy with them until I tried to use the mounts with bigger screens.

Anyway, long story short, a couple weeks after I got the firmware update-- which, in my opinion, shouldn't have been necessary in the first place-- my card reader just stopped working altogether.  Won't read anything, doesn't show up in the disc utility as even being plugged into the computer.  Just plain ridiculous."
1163,"I'll be darned.  This monocular actually delivered as advertised.  I think most of us know that when you purchase any optical instrument at very low price; chances are that somewhere along the way it will have problem.  Another Carson product I purchased in the past (zoom microscope) was exactly like that.  It was very difficult to focus, very narrow field-of-view and simply pain to use.This monocular, conversely had been opposite.  As others have already noted, it really does do excellent job of extreme close focus.  This monocular is so low priced that you don't have to baby it.  If you lose it or break it then just buy another one.FYI in case you decide to purchase this.  If you're sensitive to glue or plastic smell you may need to aerate it first because my monocular smelled when I first opened the box and used it.  Also, people with extreme near-sight vision wearing glasses may have some problem focusing on certain objects like plants or forest.Update:  10/04/12I lost my original monocular so I placed order for replacement.  The new one unfortunately will not focus clearly.  No matter how much I tried to adjust the focus, the object I am looking will not lose the blurry picture.  Hence, I am dropping my ranking to two stars.  Being that this monocular's low price tag, I am just going to toss it away."

Unfortunately they did not comepletely fix the autofocus, it did ok in light, just not dark, i didnt have time to send the item back for a couple months, then when i did they claimed i ""impacted"" it.

Understand that I'm on the edge of being OCD for being careful with loading, closing, making sure the seal is good, and so on.The Flip folks were great about replacing my camera. Even offered to try to save what was recorded, but didn't get it even though they thought it was on the camera they sent back to me.Took a few months for a replacement of the case. First it wasn't available. Then they offered to reimburse for the cost. Around November 08, I was reimbursed. They included some USB extensions as a gesture for waiting. I appreciated the gesture.Too bad. If it actually worked, at some of these snorkeling spots, you could probably get a bunch of people lined up to buy as soon as they got back home."
1171,"I purchased this unit (TEW-637AP) for $33 in July 2013, as I wanted a low cost &#34;AP only&#34; solution for my home. This unit performed well for nearly 6 months. Unfortunately, I began having issues with losing the wireless connection.It started as only occurring (noticeably) once every couple of days. I would lose wireless network connectivity for about 30 seconds, then it would return. This issue progressed into occurring every couple of minutes within 2 weeks of when I first noticed the issue. I checked that the issue was not with interference or the power supply (as it is in a lot of cases), but with the AP. I found that the unit was power cycling when the drops were occurring. Luckily, I had a backup Linksys to put in its place!I contacted TrendNet support and requested an RMA, to which they complied, but I discovered that TN does not cover shipping costs. With the likeliness that I would probably receive a refurbished unit anyway, and having to pay approximately half the original cost of the hardware for shipping, I decided to just dispose of this product and find a more reliable alternative.Summary:This product worked wonderfully initially.The signal strength was above average for similarly priced hardware.The lifetime was very disappointing/ did not meet expectations.If you need an AP solution for your home and want to save a few bucks, the TEW-637AP may be the product for you. However, in my case, I do not feel that I got what I paid for from TrendNet. 6 months of use for $33, but I would have at least expected this to last for a couple of years before giving out..If you decide to purchase this unit, I hope that you have better luck than I did. Otherwise, I hope that you found my review helpful!5/5 stars while the unit was working. -3 stars due to failure and poor warranty terms."
1172,"The device is functional for MP3 songs, not great, but OK.  The construction feels cheap, but then again, it is cheap... a 2GB for under $20 in Sept 09 is a bargain.  The price is the reason I bought the unit.  All I wanted was a device to listen to audiobooks when I am on traveling.  But for audiobooks there is a serious problem... the unit will not play audiobooks... at least those from my public library.  This Coby is not compatible, for some unknown reason with audiobooks.  I tried to find out if there was a solution and I called Coby's ""support 800 number"" well, their tech support is on the cheap too.  I waited 51 minutes to hookup with Coby tech support... 51 minutes!  Thankfully, I have a speaker phone.  When I finally connected with tech, I was told that SOME Cobys have problems in this area and I needed to get a program to remove the DRM (Digital Rights Management)... what, for a public, legal, library download, Nah.  If all you want is to put some songs on this Coby, well it could be OK, but for those that want audiobooks, AVOID this Coby.  Conditionally recommended."

The subs on both sets are about the same, good deep bass.  It would have been nice if they had put the bass control knob for the sub on the control pod instead of the back of the subwoofer.  Both sets sound good, but I prefer the Boston's.  I've got to test them out a while longer, but so far I'm pretty happy.Update to my previous review, I've been through 2 sets of these so far and both times one of the satellite speakers has gone out.  The problem seems to be with the subwoofer, too bad, I really liked these speakers.  After the second set went out, I got rid of them and got a set of Logitech Z-623's and couldn't be happier."
1174,umm well first of all itd be nice if the mfctr would state what this box is TUNED to... anyone know?
1175,"I love most of Philips' electronics products.  I've got a Philips TV, DVD Players, a DVD Recorder (hard drive model), and Norelco razors and I love them all.  On the other hand, this particular Philips product, the DCP951/37 player, has stunned me with dismay.  I bought it on sale for $49.95 at BigLots a few weeks ago and still took it back.  It wasn't marked refurb.  It had all the indications of being new so I presume it was, in fact, new.I had no intention of using the iPod dock.  I don't have a iPod.  The iPod tray is built to also store the remote control and it works nicely for that.DivX in a portable intrigued me.  On day 2, playing approximately the 3rd disc ever inserted, it stopped recognizing DivX files.  The same DivX/XviD files on the same discs that played the day before now wouldn't work.  If that was the only disappointment, I'd have RMA'd it to get another.  It was only one of many shortcomings, however.The sound emanating from its tiny speakers offers spectral quality that is okay for tiny speakers but the amplitude is too weak to be functional in any but the most quiet situations you could imagine.  My hearing is quite good yet it was difficult to hear this player in the kitchen with water running and a few pans of food sizzling on the stove.  Even a cheapie little hand-held portable radio can render audio louder than this Philips player.  You'd have to consider it only for headphone use and maybe that's why they provided 2 headphone outputs.  I never used headphones with this player so I can't report about the amplitude of the headphone outputs.So, it wouldn't play DivX/XviD any more and I couldn't hear it unless I was in an extremely quiet environment, but I still thought I'd keep it for $49.95 if it would work as a picture frame.  Well, it does work as a picture frame, but only if you manually set it's display ratio to 4:3 and suffer the small display area.  It just isn't hardwired to adjust the display of a standard photographic JPEG file to its 16:9 display.  It will display them, but, it cuts off people's heads and such.  One thing I will say, however, is that it reads large sized high res low compression JPEG files very rapidly compared to other DVD players I've tried.  I only used SD cards in it.  I think it will also read other types.Battery life was good.  It claimed about 2 hours and I got a little over 2.5 hours.  It's just enough power to watch most movies.The display is crisp and colorful but a little too dark for most environments.  I had to manually tweak it.  In bright sunlight?  Well, no LCD can really compete with sunrays so I won't even address that.  It did well in a brightly lit kitchen and living room.  Action revealed just a little smearing but I only noticed that when really looking for it.As with many Philips products, it has a very short file name capability.  It's limited to approximately 10 to 13 characters and the rest is purely truncated.I never did try MP3's.  Never got that far.  The other problems made me pack it up and return it so I don't even know if it can do all sorts of VBR and I don't even know if it can do anything with an ID3.Philips has other players in this price range.  I'd pass up this one (even for $49.95) and look at others.Philips gives a 1 year warranty on its products.  That's outstanding in the field.  That warranty period helps keep me loyal to the brand name.By the way, in a Philips model number, the /37 indicates U.S.A."
1176,"The playback quality of this machine is impressive, but it falls short in many other areas. I got this recorder to copy my old VHS to DVD. I read the customer reviews and saw that it could not copy protected video.  I thought this was no big deal because most of my collection is old or things that I did not expect to be protected (Abbot and Costello, for example). Now while I like the fact that I can set it to record and it will stop when the tape is done, it is a useless feature if the tapes will not record. A way around this may be to plug a VCR into the line in jack, but that negates the purpose of the built in VCR. I have returned this and will look into a DVD recorder with a tuner and I'll just plug in a VCR into it."
1177,"I returned this DLP TV.  I love SCI-Fi and action!  This doesn't cut it!  Everything is choppy, a blur and deep space is more grey then black because the contrast ratio is super low.  To top this off the DLP/lamp died after a few weeks and they wanted me to spend an additional $450 for a replacement lamp. I was told that with the DLP type TVs (brand doesn't matter), it will always need a lamp replacement! While they state a lamp 'can' last up to 3 years, it is not a fact that it will and it is NOT covered under their warranty.  I sent it back and purchased a smaller LCD ToC.On average to above average usage, you can replace the lamp 1-3 times a year (direct quote from lamp company!); thus you can spend an additional $1350 a year on lamps. By the way, when you purchase your lamp replacement you 'can' buy a warranty good for ONE replacement within the guaranteed time period. Those of you that love this DLP/lamp technology, there are companies that refurbish lamps like new and you can save more than 50% on the cost.  These places that refurbish, also will recycle your old lamp so, you don't have to add to the huge landfill.So, is it really worth the up front savings?  I say keep your money, because there is a new version of TV coming out soon which is made for Sci-fi and action (no lamps to replace)!  This new version will reduce the prices of the current LCD too, in case you can't afford the latest/greatest."
1178,"These may work wonderfully, but they didn't fit my ear well. And then I paid to ship them back (plus a restocking fee?)."
1179,"In the search for earhook headphones with a gold plated connector I found these to be one of the few.  I have been using Philips ear hook headphones for years, but they switched to chrome plating their connector.  The problem with chrome plating is it corrodes quickly and makes the connection very unreliable (when being used for workouts and being exposed to sweat and other moisture.Well I must say these skull candy headphones sound very hollow and nowhere near as good as the $7 a set Philips earhooks I have used for years.  I will just switch back to the Philips brand and apply some electrical silicone to the connector in hopes to stave off the corrosion."
1180,"It always kills me how much Sony charges for their accessories.  It's got to be triple the amount they are actually worth, but the good news is that you can by the same product for a lot less from 3rd party manufacturers.  Sony will try to scare you into not buying accessories that don't have ""Sony"" branded on them with threats of cancelling the warranty, but the reality is that the 3rd products not only work just as well 90% of the time, they often work BETTER and are more reliable!  If I could buy a clone PS3 I would buy it in a minute.  I've had such deplorable customer support from Sony that I shutter to even think of buying another overpriced Sony product.  Unfortunately, I can only get a PS3 from Sony but I can buy better accessories at less painful prices from other manufacturers.  There is virtually no difference between this controller for the PS3 and the controller for the PS2 other than firmware limitations keeping the PS2 controller from working on the PS3, yet the price is substantially higher.  Try Logitech.  Very reliable, better feel and a lower price."
1181,"The audio quality on these intercoms is very muffled and distorted. These units must be ""married"" to each other in ""learn"" mode, and this process can be extremely frustrating to implement.  When you change the batteries you'll often have to go through the same frustrating ""learn"" process.  I've grown to hate these intercoms.  One of these days they're going to end up in the trash!"
1182,what i mean by poor design is when this unit is plugged in to the wall it leaves a gap between the wall and the unit itself so basically it is slanted when plugged in
1183,"I got my Sansa Fuse and it looks nice and seemed to work okay for about an hour.  Then it shut off while I was trying to upload a playlist and won't turn back on.  I am returning it for a refund and will try to find an MP3 player that isn't so poorly made.I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it at least has a nice illusion of quality to it, and would probably work well as a pocket-sized paperweight."
1184,"I was comfortable using an old Logitech laser corded Wheel Mouse M-BD58. I recently started switching mousing hands to relieve the stress of intense computer work. I figured a cordless mouse would eliminate the hassle of the cord getting caught on stuff every time I moved it from right to left and back. I ordered a Logitech v450 cordless laser (red). I was surprised when my hand started to ache after briefly using the new mouse. I checked to see if it was significantly higher than my old corded mouse. It was the same height.The only difference I noticed was that the new v450 was slightly narrower than my old mouse so that my hand draped over it more. This slight difference cause the ache. I switched back to my old corded mouse. I knew I was sensitve to mouse shape; that's why I stay away from microsoft mice and only use Logitech, I didn't realize that mouse fitting is as subtle as getting the right shoe."
1185,"While one of the photos clearly shows a remote and the specs for the remote are given ... it is not included with this model. I have been working with the original shipper to get the problem resolved. They have no other products in a similar price range with the remote so, sadly, it is going back."
1186,"To keep it short and sweet, the 2100 max unit was returned.  I bought it for my spouse who is not technically inclined.  I feel that she was a good test subject for this review, which wasn't my intent as I only wanted her to have an easy to use personal navigation device (PND).  The Navigon 2100 max has many great features for the price, but also too many issues and wasn't worth the frustration.  Using it made me feel like I was beta testing a development product.  Maybe a firmware update will fix the problems.  I need a PND with a better user interface (UI), more Points of Interest (POI) and reliability.  Each person is different, so I recommend that you always get a PND from a store with a good return policy.Pros:- 4.3"" touch screen.- Free life-time traffic updates, but must activate the service online- Traffic information antenna built into the auto charging cable, so not external antenna required (also a downside).- Spoken street names via text-to-speech.- Lane Assist is a view that helps with choosing which lane to be in for the upcoming intersection.- Reality View is a more realistic view of the upcoming road changes.- Route planning can add multiple stops to your route.- Predictive Text helps to speed up typing with text that guides you, but this had a downside.- Optional Fresh Maps is a paid for service ($80.00US) that provides quarterly map updates for 3 years.Cons:- Documentation online, no CD in the box.  Remember this when you're on the road and need help with the device.- Crashed the first time it was turned on that required going online for the documentation to learn how to properly reset the device.- The user interface is less than intuitive.  You will need to learn the ""navigon"" way of UI navigation.  This can be frustrating.  Oh, and with no printed documentation to reference, well you get the idea.- The UI icons, text and buttons are very small and therefore difficult to see.- Points of Interest database is pathetic and no way to update.- Traffic information is not incorporated into a route, you could still be routed through a closed road or exit, which happened to me.- Traffic alerts kept appearing for problems not on the route.- Traffic service didn't work outside of the metro areas.- Route planning feature doesn't optimize the route path between route points.- You must use Navigon's USB cable or you will get a ""Sync"" screen on the device.  Better get a spare from Navigon.- The battery life is dismal, my unit constantly displayed the low charge warning after only 30 minutes, and then would die shortly thereafter.- Satellite acquisition indoors was miserable.- Crappy speaker gets more distorted the louder it gets, and you need to turn it up because the volume is very low by default.- Predictive Text would not let me enter a street number or name if it wasn't in the device database, which happened on several occasions.  My spouse just gave up when the streets or addresses couldn't be entered.- After a week the device started to frequently lock up, requiring a reset.Overall I feel that Navigon is on the right track with it's feature list and pricing.  I may have got a bad unit, but with the number of issues it wasn't worth the frustration.  I will pay a little more for something that just works.  When I have to fight with the technology, it's going back."
1187,This item is also available as a single unit for $7.95 from the same vendor.  This is an excellent battery but it is better to pay $16 for two than $25 for two.
1188,"Love the idea of the splitter...used it with my Kindle to share a movie on a plane flight. One side of the plug does not seem to be as loud as the other and overall, the ability to increase the volume is limited. On a plane ride, this makes it difficult to hear the movie. Unless your headphones ALSO have the ability to increase the volume, this is best used for quiet sharing."
1189,I am dissapointed with this bag. This stitching has come out of one or two of the straps so it doesn't work quite write anymore. I hadn't even really used the bag yet.Also the bag is an odd shape. It's like a soccer ball shape. I plan on replacing this bag in the near future.
1190,"First, my Mac thinks that it is a headphone type device, so it cuts out the headphone jack on the Mac when this is in use.  Next, there is a lot of static when it was in my bedroom about 20 ft away and going through interior walls (but the doors were open and it had a line of sight to the computer).  The other thing is that the Mac wants you to choose these every time you power them on or off.  They aren't automatically detected and start playing music.I had to run a headphone cable to these speakers and it now works the way I want.  But it kind of defeats the purpose of having Bluetooth.  Look for other wireless speaker options if you need it to be wireless.  With the 3.5"" headphone type cable plugged in, I can turn the power on and off and they play at the same time as all of the other audio speakers I have in my house and they don't sound too bad."
1191,"audio loses quality over the cable noticeably, but there is no clipping and it gets the sound from one end of the room to the other."
1192,This TV was mounted in a RV bedroom.  When laying down on the bed the TV picture was completely washed out.  The sound was bad as well.  Don't get this unless you can look straight at it!
1193,"I thought this external hard drive would be easy to use to back up important files I don't want to lose. I'm a ""technically challenged"" person, not an IT expert, so I wanted a user manual or user guide that told me everything I needed to know about using it and explained it in simple layman's terms.The manufacturers of electronic devices and the technical writers of user guides and/or manuals take it for granted that users will automatically have as much technical knowledge about its use as they do! This false assumption makes it extremely frustrating for a buyer who pays for a device and then doesn't know how to use it. I'm afraid that if I do something wrong I'll wipe out my files.When the manual says ""drop and drag files to transfer data"", is that referring to COPYING (for backup only) or actually MOVING files from my computer to the external hard drive?  Why isn't this made clear for non-techie users? And, naturally, there's no customer service phone number so I can ask a knowledgeable (hopefully) person!"
1194,"The title says it. Good if you need just to get some air flowing, but for serious cooling look elsewhere."
1195,"this is the fist time i am using the soft boxes, i do not know how those looks like. Its plastic..looks like cheep one. not worth. but still i am using."
1196,I got one from Targus brand that has a larger tip and works much much better than this one.  Go with a Targus!  Sorry Boxwave!
1197,"The bag arrived and upon unpacking I noticed that there was no protection for the sides and top of the bag.  The sides and top of this bag are just nylon, there's no foam core, so there's no protection on 75% of the surface area of the bag.  This is NOT, REPEAT NOT a bag for photography equipment.  This is some sort of hybrid made to look like it is a bag for photography equipment.  I am keeping the bag simply because it was cheap and has wheels."
1198,"Bought this to go with a Onkyo Surround System with Receiver.  I have not figured out how to get video out of the iPod Touch yet, even getting audio seems to be sketchy at times?  The remote does not seem to work either, so it is a very expensive charging dock with connections for playing music through the receiver.  Admittedly I have not spent any time trying to figure this out, nor am I willing to.  If you plug it up to the correct input on the receiver it should just work, it does not.  The $25 Belkin dock does everything this one does for me at $100 less, I have bought two of them for other systems.This may be less the fault of Onkyo's design and more due to the fact that Apple changes the iPod interface every 15 minutes.  They are masterful at designed obsolescence so older accessories don't charge the new iPods and some other functionality is probably lost as well."
1199,"I replaced a D-Link access point with the Linksys WRT610N.  It was quick to setup and has nice connectivity options.  Unfortunately, it delivered about a third of the throughput, even with wired connections.  It also dropped my internet connections often."
1200,"I upgraded my MacBook Pro Unibody from 2 GB to 4 GB with the Kingston memory.  I upgraded solely because my MacBook Pro would experience slow performance when running multiple applications.  Thus, the logical solution would be to double the RAM.  After extensive research, I chose the Kingston based on the consensus reviews on quality and reliability and value.  However, after installing the RAM, my MacBook Pro was still slow; I don't think there was any noticeable difference.  The MacBook OS recognized the increased memory so it was obviously installed correctly.  I have no idea why the upgrade made zero difference.  I don't run any crazy memory intensive applications.  Just a few normal ones.  Thus, I'm scratching my head wondering why I spent so much money on something that's basically worthless and useless in my case.  And why I can only rate this 2 stars."
1201,"Seriously besides the price point, expect this plastic notebook pad not to last you very long. It only took a couple months for it to crack for me. Poor laptop support. Spend your money elsewhere! You get what you pay for."
1202,"One of the worst Microsoft keyboards that I have owned. This keyboard suffers from intolerable delays and signal drop-outs, even though it's only 2 ft. or so away from the wireless receiver. The backspace key does not work reliably and causes the keyboard to ""drop out"" occasionally. It's maddening when letters are missed or duplicated while I'm typing quickly, this keyboard is plagued by these types of issues. The lack of a sleep key is also a big drawback of this keyboard.I have not had problems with other models of wireless Microsoft keyboards that I have owned in the past, just this one. I'll probably be returning this one before the 30-day deadline hits."
1203,"I have this D-Link DIR-628 connected to a desktop PC (hardwired) and a Midnight Company C laptop (via 802.11g). Both computers are running Windows XP Pro SP3 and I use Time Warner cable broadband. I don't have any other 802.11n capable devices, but I figured that if the router worked well in G, then it might be worth upgrading the laptop to use an N card. I also have a Linksys WRT54GL router, which I used for comparison.Unfortunately, I keep having a recurrent issue with this router. While it works flawlessly with the hardwired PC, the connection with the laptop via 802.11g keeps stalling. Both the router and the laptop still show that they are connected to each other with a strong signal, but the data transfer completely ceases. I have to power cycle the router and establish a new connection with the laptop for data transfer to resume. Within an hour, the data transfer rate begins to slow down gradually until it ceases again. Then the whole procedure has to be repeated. It's very annoying.While the problem could reside in the laptop, the router or the broadband connection (i.e. cable modem), I'm confident that it is due to the router. While the router-laptop data transfer is stopped, I can still access The Internet via the hardwired desktop. This tells me that it's not the cable modem or broadband. If I use the Linksys router with the same configuration, I don't have this issue at all. Perhaps there is an incompatibility between this D-Link router and the laptop, but it's odd that the connection does work for a limited amount of time. I've searched for a timeout setting in the router software, but haven't been successful.On the plus side, when the wireless connection is working properly, the signal and transfer rate are as strong as the with Linksys router. It also looks a bit better than the Linksys routers."
1204,"**The sound quality is really poor. No bass effect at all. The headphones supplied with this product are average ones. Certainly not for good listening. It does have 5 Band Graphic equiliser But I wonder what does it do? You change the settings to anything .. No effect on the output.

When you start from menu item no 1 to next..next..next... When It reaches the last menu item, pressing the down button does not take you to Menu item no 1. It drove me crazy. You have to browse all the way back to the first menu by again pressing the upper button several times.In short ...Menu scrolling is not user friendly.**It detects the wifi internet connections but when you try to connect to one of it....It just says  'Connecting to ' and never actually connects to wifi.It just hangs.

Mine just hanged...and it powered itself off after 5 minutes.**The speaker provided is not stereo. Not loud enough.-----  Few very good things about this player are..Very nice FM radio reception.Good for watching photos and movies where you are least care about sound quality.Only very good thing is Its Price TAG. Pretty low priced.If you are really looking for a good MP3 player... This is not for you.I returned mine in 2 days."
1205,"The price is good and it does work fine so far.  I had trouble installing it and had to call Charter Cable for help.  The technician told me to turn on the modem first and wait until the modem is ready then turn on the Router.  I don't know why I have to wait like this, but it worked.  I've only used it for an hour so far so I might update this review later.11/11/11 - UPDATE - The router crashes about 2 to 3 times a week.  I'm not sure if it's the modem having compatibility problem.  Either way, I give up and I'm going to by an all-in-one gateway instead."
1206,"If your setup includes an auxiliary cable connecting your device to a PC's input audio port and you hear noise a few seconds after audio has stopped playing on your device then this may not be the fix for you, as for me it only brings the the noise level down 50% and that half of the noise wines. Perhaps it may be of use to me sometime in the future."
1207,"This keyboard is OK, but that's about it.Yes... the illumination is alright, like the selection of colors etc. and it does come in handy when working in a dimly lit environment.However, like many other reviewers have said, those shortcut keys on the side of the keyboard can wreak havoc. Just barely touching them can open multiple instances of the calculator, bookmarks, etc. Add to that is the sad fact that they can not be customized. I bought this keyboard for quick access to multimedia, but sadly, it just plain does not work. (My thought was to program the music shortcut key to open up my DAW, but sadly, this is a no go.I recommend that most stay away from this keyboard if you want anything other than a simple lighted keyboard. Many of the features are elusive or just plain do NOT work. Example: that little lighted volume indicator... on the top left of the keyboard... it DOES NOT WORK... always pinned at max.If you want a lighted keyboard with color settings this is for you... but don't expect it to be much better than that."
1208,"I had the older, 80GB, iPod classic which still works perfectly even though its 4 years old.  As I used up all of my space I decided to order the next generation version of 160GB.  BAD mistake.  I ordered via Company A and received the iPod in a box way too big for shipping w/out proper protection.  The packagers used one of those fat air bubbles (which came to me deflated) and so my iPod was rattling around in the oversized box for who knows how long w/out proper protection in shipping.  This iPod made a lot of loud noises whenever it turned on, switched songs, etc.  My old one NEVER made these noises.  So I returned it and asked for a replacement.  I specifically requested the phone rep to make sure it was packaged much better.  The replacement came the SAME way (deflated bubble and all!) and makes the same noise.  For reference, the high pitched whining noise is loud enough that when I'm listening to my music the hard drive noise is louder than the music coming out of my speakers!  So returning it I must.  I will try buying this directly via a store so I can try and get one that isn't damaged due to improper shipping.  FYI: before returning this replacement I had my iPod checked out by an Apple store rep AND my computer repair guy.  Both folks had never heard of an iPod making such loud noises and couldn't guarantee that the drive wouldn't die (or wasn't already dying).  Sorry Company A, you are my primary source for purchasing items but not this time AND not for any future electronic items.The Good: Much bigger capacity than my older iPod, tactile wheel feels better and is more responsive than past modelThe Bad: Hard drive is so FREAKING fragile that its on its last leg just after SHIPMENT!  Granted that may be due to extremely poor shipping protection, but still!  I bought my older iPod online and its working perfectly still (I just ran out of space)."
1209,I purchased this for my older son to keep him away from my iPod. He rarely played music on this and lost it continually. Not a great buy . I suggest you spend  the extra money on a regular-sized  iPod.
1210,"I bought this router to mainly upgrade my home to gigabit Ethernet, Wireless N isn't needed yet, but eventually will be. I'm quite experienced with setting up routers and such, and couldn't get wireless working no matter what. The best I could do is get some of my clients to get IP addresses, but beyond that there was no useability. I tried resetting to factory defaults even though the router was already there, and also downloaded and installed the latest firmware, which was also already on the router. I'm assuming this is a good product and I just got a lemon. I returned it for a different router."
1211,"As I write this the price via Company A is almost $490 through TechNGnet.  The Samsung BD-P2550 is a BestBuy exclusive item and it's on sale (in the store and online) there for $349.99. Go to BestBuy, save $100 and buy some DVDs :-)"
1212,"This is not an ergonomic keyboard, but more of a gag gift for a ""geek"" or ""nerd"" you know.Keys are very hard to push (sometime requiring multiple strikes to register) and keyboard format/layout is not normal (hard to adjust to).Bought this to replace faulty laptop keyboard, but gave up using the foldable keyboard, and fixed the laptop keyboard instead.While this makes a great gift, it does not work well for everyday use - I would suggest a more ergonomic keyboard.  Although, if you are going to have an office in water, this could do to the trick (its water resistant)."
1213,"Didn't last more than a few weeks. The plastic is certainly strong, but the exposed gold connectors are completely unprotected. Strangely, the connectors seem OK, but the thing just stopped working. Frankly, I don't think it's worth the risk. If you are traveling, go a tiny bit larger and get something that is adequately protected."

1215,"It really pains me to write the following review as I really like Patagonia products and have owned many over the years:I have to agree with the majority of the reviews. The Patagonia Kindle case could be a five star recommend at $20.00 but at twice that price it shows a real lack of thought in the design.Pros:The one and only pro in my opinion is the quality of materials and craftsmanship. The case is well constructed with green materials.Cons:1) Poor protection of the Kindle screen. It would have cost another dime to have inserted a stiffener in the cover. Extra padding isn't what it needs. What it needs is a sheet of some sort of stiff material, plastic, aluminum... that actually protects the screen. At $40 they could afford to put a bamboo stiffener in to maintain the green theme.2) The corner holders are flaky. The Kindle is too easily dislodged from the case and I expect that it will only get worse as the case gets more use. I'll probably stop at Home Depot and pick up some Velcro dots to hold the Kindle in the case like I did with my K1.3)No handle. Yes there are some loops on the outside of the case for holding it while reading but it really should have had a strap on the spine that allows for easier carrying.4) No pencil or pen holder. The Kindle may be an electronic book reader but its primitive annotation capabilities don't eliminate the need for paper notes. I usually carry a small notebook to make notes, usually a Moleskin style notebook, that will nicely slip into the cover pocket but what do I do with the pen? If you slip the pen into the cover pocket you run the risk of cracking or scratching the display. Patagonia could have easily designed the case with a pen slot in the spine of the case. There is lots of room in the spine area for pen/pencil storage.Hopefully Patagonia is reading these comments and will redesign the case and incorporate the constructive criticism into a new design."
1216,The biggest problem I've encountered with these discs is that after the burning process dark purplish colored stains appears on many of them. This may have to do with the way they were manufactured but whatever the cause the discs with these purplish stains cannot be played. Out of the 20 I've burned so far 6 have had this mottling on them and have been unreadable by any DVD player. I've used different burners and have not had this issue with other brands on any of the burners so I ruled out faulty or defective hardware that way. I won't be be buying this brand through Company A anymore.
1217,"The audio quality and comfort of this headset is fine -- more than adequate, given the low cost.But there is an in-line module that adjusts the volume, as well as muting the microphone.  This little hunk of plastic ruins the whole thing; it frequently changes volume levels, loses one channel of the stereo audio, and cuts in and out when adjustments are made.  I have to fiddle with the dial to get both channels, and there only seem to be three levels that don't cut out; too loud, a little too quiet, and far too quiet.The ear cups are certainly not sized to fit over adult ears; just to rest on the pinna.  I don't have any serious problems with comfort with them; I'm frequently wearing these for several hours at a stretch, and only my general sense of irritation at having my hearing muffled makes me take breaks every half hour or so.I'll keep using them, although I might end up popping open the volume gizmo and cutting it out of the circuit.  I suspect that would be a pretty trivial soldering job, but it shouldn't be necessary."
1218,"I purchased this card and expected to copy files from my C: to usbb2 external drive faster, and easily. it did not work right away. After I spent couple days, I found a trick: need usb2 cable to provide power for esata port to run, meaning I need both cable esata and usb connected to my external hard disk to get better speed when copy files. It's weird.When I plug only esata cable from the card to my ext-hard-drive, there is no light on the enclosure indicating the disk is active, and no new disk found under device manage. I cannot copy files.When I plug both USB2 and eSATA cables, the disk can been seen and confirmed under pci-bus (hardware manager), meaning the external hard disk can operate via the esata port.Using the teraCopy tool (free download), I can see the difference of copy the same file: 30MB/s using USB, and 40MB/s using eSATA cable (also with USB2 for power supply).Using Window7, copy files from C: to usb2 hard drive, the speed is around 12MB/s. While copy the same file from C: to another local D:, the speed is about 52MB/s. I expected this high speed when use this card for copying files to external hard drive using esata connection.I will purchase another card, but not this model. I realized I get what I paid :-)"
1219,"The easy program/macro-program feature didn't work for either my tv or my sound system, and it wouldn't program at all with my sony sound system. A bit disappointed. Also it doesn't come with instructions, aka NO PROGRAMMING GUIDE for all those numbers that you'll need since the auto program doesn't work lol.  Not a bad remote though."
1220,The remote works. But using the mouse on the remote is so frustrating you will feel like throwing the remote out of the windows.
1221,"Received this product promptly and it arrived in good condition.  The only problem I have is that there are virtually no comprehensible instructions on how to make it work.  The instructions given with the unit remind one of the 1960s where imported items contained instructions written by someone where English was a third language.  The instructions with this item are vague and very incomplete, making them worthless.  I have yet to find time to go into the necessary trial and error process to make the product work so I have to give it two stars, and this is a very charitable evaluation. If I can't figure out how to make it work in a reasonable period of time, I shall be returning it."
1222,"Since MSN-Direct will no longer provide service after 1/1/2012, I purchased the Garmin GTM20 with Lifetime Traffic for my nuvi 885T.  I probably would have given the GTM20 a 5-star if I never had MSN-Direct.  The GDB50 with MSN-Direct is superior by far with all the other information it provided, but GTM20 with Lifetime Traffic is better than nothing.  It appears to me the FM signals are weaker in my area, and my 885T shows the GTM20 NAVTEQ Lifetime Traffic needs to be activated when you go into tools, but it doesn't.  Maybe Garmin will come out with a fix for it.  Hopefully NAVTEQ or another service can fill in the void of MSN-Direct over time."
1223,"It would be nice,  I would of gave it more stars,  if I received the right size (15.6)  that I ordered.  After six days of shipping time, they sent me a (14.1) in the color red. This was my reply back to the seller.  They gave me credit for my order.  That was great.  Needlessly to say  this sleeve didn't even come close to fitting my laptop,  and its too big for my tablet... ( Looks Nice on the web page though.)  Came in a Plastic envelope all curled up to fit in  the mail box,  since you can't really damage it."
1224,"First of all, I had a product that failed after a few weeks and I had to send it in for warranty service.  The replacement worked fine for just over a year and then failed.  Having had the replacement for just over the warranty period, I assume that this one is a planned failure.  So in summary, it might work well for awhile but don't expect it to last."
1225,"I don't have a souped up or overclocked machine, but since it runs almost all the time, I thought ""cooler is better"".  Not wanting to rely on the cooler that came with the CPU, I found this monstrous device with the huge fan, copper heat pipes and foolishly assumed that such a fancy looking contraption would translate into powerful cooling.Unfortunately, there are some bugs in the design and the end result is my CPU runs around 55C most of the time, which I'm sure the stock CPU fan would achieved, if not better.As another reviewer noted, the base of the heat sink has substantial grooves in it where the heat pipes run through.  I used plenty of high performance thermal compound to compensate for this, but it still seems like a design flaw and may account for the poor performance.Installation is not terribly difficult, but it does take up a lot of room.  Fortunately, I have a large enough case that this was not a problem, but it was still awkward.  I checked carefully to be sure it was mounted firmly, which it was, but there is something about the finished install that left me feeling unsure that it was in there good.  Those push-pin connectors are not the best set-up to begin with, but with a big unit like this one, they leave a lot to be desired.  Being as big and heavy as it is, I can't help but worry that it work loose and fall down inside the case.  It is important to take special care to make sure there is nothing blocking the rotation of the fan in operation.  I didn't think there was anything blocking the fan in my case, but I left the side off to check, and sure enough a power cable had come to rest against the fan and was stopping it from moving.On the positive side, it is cheap enough.  But I really think you could do as well with a stock cooler."
1226,"Not that it's making my 3570k idle at 60c or anything, but this thing sounds like a turbine and my brother in the room next to me can hear it, the stock cooler I had was better than this. If you're going to buy this replace the fan, that's what I'm doing now, if it still won't shut up, buying H80i."
1227,"I thought this would be a little nicer for the cost.  It is a very cheap looking and feeling plastic cover basically.  I will likely throw this out and buy a ""gel"" type case protector.  Basically I was just a lot less impressed than I thought I would be.  It does dock OK with my Onkyo radio though."
1228,It was still a nice buy as my first flash - I am learning a lot with it.For the price I paid it is wonderful buy for exploring the use of flash. If it is your first flash - buy it for learning purposes.
1229,"I'm no videographer by any stretch, just looking for a good quality HD cam for family events. I've no complaints about the usability, menus, battery, file format, or anything else. It's all fine. I just want the best possible video quality without going broke.Outdoors and under optimal lighting, the footage from the HF200 looks spectacular.Indoors under less than optimal lighting, the quality is just not acceptable. It's inferior to even many SD cameras costing way less.I fear that HD video takes CPU resources to encode/compress the footage, and there's less money left over to put into the optics and sensor. I'm now questioning whether my $500 be better spent on crystal clear SD versus grainy & noisy HD.I absolutely love the outdoor footage I've taken so far. But with so many events indoors (parties, holidays), this camera just won't cut it."
1230,"My router is on the second floor of the house and I bought this hoping to receive better signal than the existing adapter in my 2 years old laptop.With the 2.4 band, I was able to get 130 Mbps on my existing adapter, with this is one the signal was not getting above 50 Mbps at the same location. As far as the 5.0 band, the signal was almost non exist ant, and that is understandable due to the distance from this device to the router."
1231,"I've taken about 3000 pictures with this camera over several months.  Initially the pictures were very good, with only a few out of focus.  However, over time, more and more of the pictures are out of focus.  I am in the market for a new camera."
1232,"I got this camera because it was on sale, a good bargain for a 12 MP camera. I have a Samsung 52"" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot. The price was much less than the competition from Sony or Mitsubishi on the TV I felt like I got a real value and thought I would trust Samsung again because I knew what they are capable of.The SL620 is a nice form factor, fits in my pocket and comes out ready for action quickly. It has the 12.2 Megapixels and 5x zoom, really astonishing technical achievements in a great package.There are some things that I do not like about this camera that might have been deal breakers had I known about it before my purchase.I really do not like the proprietary USB port and cable. Every time I go to hook this up to charge it or download the mini-hdmi (what it looks like) connector does not want to connect. It is hard to see whether it is up or down because it is so small. This is really irritating, and I am sure would be expensive if I ever lost or damaged the cable. A big thumbs down for that. I have gotten used to a standard mini-USB cable, but Samsung uses this one port for download, charging, and displaying to TV as well which probably saves money and parts - for them, but it does nothing to make the camera easier or better to use.Second thing is that I love the on-screen help, but when you flick between modes the text is on the screen not even fast enough to read - and I'm a pretty fast reader - very frustrating. You have to keep clicking away and back to read the help screens? Maybe there is a setting to adjust this, but learning the camera becomes harder, and when they do not implement the help well, it is worse than no help at all because it is just a distraction. Otherwise the menus are laid out pretty well and logically.Next is the viewfinder. I have found that I have to be very conservative, ie. move back and try to give extra margin around my subject to shoot because what I see on the viewfinder is not necessarily the picture I end up with. I have not really analyzed this to find out exactly where the picture is or how it changes with modes, but one needs to see on the viewscreen exactly what the picture is, otherwise the viewscreen is useless too.I wish I could post some video I shot on this camera, the subject is off to the top of the frame, and even cut off. When I was shooting it it was all in the center of the viewscreen. This is a major problem ... I wish I could take it back at this point.The pictures are so huge that taking the picture seems to take a while before the camera comes back. The ""snappiness"" of the response leaves a bit to be desired.I also do not like the way the zoom is implemented as a vertical rocker switch up near the top of the trigger. Your thumb wants to move right and left if you hold the camera like a normal human being, and making it go up and down really makes the zoom clumsy to use, and makes the camera more likely to shake.As I said, I like the form factor, the detail is wonderful, the size and shape are great. The picture quality is very good. The screen help idea is great, and the text that comes up when you change modes is a good idea, but as I said you can hardly read it before it goes away leaving it just as hard to tell what mode you are in as the cameras that have no such help.I have to say I am disappointed overall in the design details of this camera, though all the parts are there and the picture is nice and very detailed an the zoom power is very good.The video is sharp and clear and very nice. I cannot say for sure but I think the image is stabilized in the video.I would recommend this camera for those who want all the features of a 12 MP 5x optical zoom for an inexpensive price and do not mind overlooking some ... what I think of anyway ... as bad design judgements. With proper tweaking this camera could have been so much much better.I wonder if Samsung can make a firmware upgrade or something to fix some of my gripes ... though I have never heard of a f/w upgrade for a camera."
1233,"I bought these to hopefully make my computer next to silent, but this didn't really help.. at all. The quality of the fans are excellent, but the noise is none less than that of the included case fans from Antec!"
1234,"I had problems with these vertical ear buds in getting them properly placed in my ears and also had problems with them staying in, regardless of what size silicone ear tips I used.  Even with the best placement I could do, the bass sounded minimal to me, even though I could vaguely hear it as they had lack of any punch.  It could be that they did not fit in correctly.  However, it did produce good mid range and highs.  I will give them to my neighbor's son as he lost his ear buds yesterday on a city bus."
1235,"This battery worked well for 8 months but then would no longer charge.  That seems like a short lifespan but I really don't know what to expect for an ""after-market"" battery.  I'm going to read the reviews and try to make a better guess for the next one.  I'll not re-purchase this one."
1236,I had to return the item due to overheating and a smelly odor started to come out of the product.
1237,"First, I'll cut to the chase: the iHome IH-A600KB numeric keypad works with Macs, as long as its Num Lock function is turned off.Now here's the rest of the story. I tested the keypad on an i7 iMac running OS 10.6.8, connecting via the USB port on a wired Apple keyboard and then via a port on a powered USB hub. No configuration or driver downloads were necessary after plugging the keypad into either port (a Keyboard Assistant window pops up but this window can be safely dismissed).What I like*USB cable is long enough to allow convenient placement for both lefties and righties, even with large laptops.*Well constructed, with strain relief on both ends of the USB cable.*LED indicator for Num Lock.*Keys for both ""0"" and ""000""*LightweightIf you've done a lot of 10-key input by touch on Apple keyboards, though, this keypad has some significant drawbacks:*The ridge on the 5 key is not very high and is too close to the edge of the key. This makes it difficult to center your fingers.*A backspace key has been placed in the upper right hand corner so the * key (multiplication) and the / key (division) are not in their usual Apple positions.*There isn't a key for =.Bottom line: the iHome keypad has several nice features and feels sturdily made. Those who do not rely on touch when doing 10-key input may find this keypad to be a good choice but I found it difficult to use quickly and accurately. Two stars."
1238,"I like the sleek, fold-up design for travel storage, but it vibrates with a 5"" Garmin 1490 GPS and I have a smooth riding midsize automobile.  The base is a bit too stiff to conform exactly to a small or steeply sloping/contoured dash.  Also leaves a noticeable residue on my textured (and clean) tan colored dash.  It won't take long for the tacky underside to fill with dust and allow the GPS and mount to slide.  Needs to be re-engineered to reduce vibration and be less reliant on the sticky underside coating to prevent slippage.  The older, smaller, and cheaper Garmin sandbag dash mount remains superior if dash contours allow use. however it is a bit more bulky."
1239,"Most frustrating issue with this product is the Microsoft Intellipoint software. After installing it I noticed that the mouse scrolls too fast so I brought up the interface but was surprised to see that the scroll speed was already set to the slowest setting. Tried all kinds of things like removing the Logitech mouse software as suggested to no avail. Scrolling on websites is sketchy; too fast at some times and acceptable at others. Also, the page will scroll by itself a few lines up or down when the mouse isn't moving. Some pages scroll uncontrollably, non-stop until reaching the bottom of the page. I finally uninstalled Intellipoint and those problems went away, although scrolling is a bit slow now and I have no means of adjusting it or changing button assignments.Keyboard is fine and looks nice. Only negative is the nearly flush ESC (and function) key which is difficult to find."
1240,This is cheap and it does not come in with the weight. Only the weight bag. One knob was already broke when it arrived. The carabiner broke on my first shoot.
1241,"Used in a cold data center, the cables were very stiff and didn't want to give up their coiled tendencies. Cables from other suppliers (Fry's and monoprice) didn't have this issue. Probably fine in a warm network closet, etc, but for cold areas I would avoid this model."
1242,"If you have a larger (Panasonic 50&#34; in my case) display, this mount will not work. The maximum distance between the holes when using this mount is about 22&#34; -- NOT compatible with my Panasonic. The product description is in error."
1243,"Very flimsy, like one mentioned below. Yes, one light wind, it felt down the ground and all the frames collapsed.Buy this if you intend to use it for indoor ONLY."
1244,"It's hard for me to believe that other reviewers didn't point this out.Clearly the designers attached the upper ends of the straps too far apart. So they added these longggg tails which they call ""molded thumb-looped strap adjusters'. People with narrow to normal shoulders will have to use the adjusters to pull the backpack up to their necks or the straps will slip off their shoulders.Still i wanted to keep it as mini backpacks are hard to find. I tried it on with a delicate summer top and no way! No matter how high up i wore it, the straps were slipping off and in two minutes of walking around the house were already irritating my shoulders. Plus those crazy strap adjusters were wagging around my hips. Next I tried adding weight to the backpack, but it help only marginally.I wanted this pack to wear around the city...with casual to business attire. This is a very heavy duty (well made), stiff, and sporty backpack which is inappropriate for anything but very sporty clothes.I'm not a tiny, wisp of a girl. i'm 5'3"" 125 pounds. I waited a couple of weeks for this to arrive and really needed it for a trip. Now I'm kind of screwed, but back it goes.While i have your attention: it seems absolutely insane that you have to pay megabucks to get a backpack that prevents thieves on crowded buses or subways from having easily access to your valuables. why oh why isn't this strap zipper compartment accessed from the underside? Why aren't all zippers against one's back. Designers are so 'uninventive' that we are asked to carry our BACKpacks on our chests(especially difficult for women) in order to prevent access."
1245,"Buyers  Beware!  NONE of these radios come anywhere near the advertised use distance, and the only place there isn't going to be some kind of obstruction/interference is the ocean or the desert, no precipitation.  I've bought 3 diff sets, each one a step above the next, and none performed even close to as advertised.  I think the only service you can reasonably expect is on a small job site, maybe in the home/yard, friends next door, or on a convoy type road trip, everyone close together.  All sorts of things will interfere with performance: rain, trees, buildings, other cars, other people on the same frequencies, stronger radios in your  area.  Remember when car phones first came out?  The phones with stronger power would over-ride your conversation, until the power strengths was regulated.  Don't buy anything with less than 4 stars, and don't believe the ad copy.I'm sure there are serviceable walkie-talkies/2-way radios available, but I expect the cost would be beyond what most people will want to spend for  everyday use."
1246,"After charging over night, this battery would not accept a charge.  I thought it was a bargain--I was definitely wrong about that."
1247,They worked for about a year of mild use and low amount of recharges. They stopped charging one day even after being over half charged before I put them in the charging cradle. Would not buy again.
1248,"Never worked, get you pay for some times, wasn't worth exchanging for such a cheap product. Better options out there, but they do cost a lot more"
1249,I've just used it a couple of times to play with my nephews.  It's not a real functional projector.  The image never gets to an acceptable focused state.  Blurry image is the best that you'll get with this if you achieve an extremely dark environment.
1250,"When I first got this I scanned hundreds of pics of my grandmother from her youth upon her death at age 95. The pictures came out amazing. The device was light and connected to the usb port. I had to load pics onto trays which was pretty easy and gave me something to do while waiting for the scan. The photo editing software that came with it (photo impressions) did a nice job of general fixes.  It is portable, lightweight and doesnt need a power sourceThat said, I hadn't used it for a few months and took it out, plugged it in...and my computer will not recognize it.. I have tried everything!In searching the net it seems others have had this problem too..except there is no place to go for support for this product!  And it looks like Hammacher Schlemmer has stopped selling it.This product did a greast job, basically taking a digital shot of pic under controlled lighting instead of scanning. It created reasonably sized great quality digital jpegs. Except now after only one year, it is nothingbut an empty box :("
1251,"I was glad to get this item for my old computer but was disappointed that there was no documentation, or disk with drivers with it.  Apparently it isn'tplug and play."" It did work on the stuff that worked with the CD drive it replaced, but apparently I need something more to get it to play a DVD or burn.  A burning program I got didn't recognize it.  I'll have to work on it in the future when I have time (which I don't have now, either the money to pay someone to do it)."
1252,"This unit will ONLY PLAY songs that are placed in the ""Sample Folder"" on the unit. Although the instructions state to put your music in separate folders you CANNOT access any other folder than the ""Sample Folder"". I put my music for each artist in its own folder, but the unit, although you could view the folder, would NOT play the music in the different folders.I contacted support by email, asking how do I access the other folders, but they NEVER answered my email. I then called their support line, but each time I called (I called 3 times) I was disconnected after being on hold for around 10 minutes.This manufacturer really needs to have a business meeting and discuss how to handle their support issues before they go out of business."
1253,"Update: 1 year after I purchased, both batteries died. They don't hold charge.-----The batteries charge and last about the same as original NB-5L Canon battery at first, but slowly lose capacity to hold charge.  I am at about 3rd charging and I am seeing a slight decrease in charge hold capacity.  But then with the money I paid, I am not complaining."
1254,"PROS-appearance, feels soft, mac logo still visible-lightweight, lighter than speck casesCONS-i bought this for my sister, she had it a month and the sides started cracking and it eventually broke. we had to superglue it cuz it's too pricey to buy a new one-the bottom part doesn't fit as snug as speck cases.-the bottom part doesn't stay on very well it leaves gaps and dirt gets it and that's what causes scratches as the dirt and grime creates friction in between the case and the macbook"
1255,The heat spreader changed the height of the memory to the point I couldn't use it.  While I suppose it's my fault for not measuring first and checking specs on the memory.  Either way I think they could have added the heat spreader without altering the usability of  the memory.
1256,"I knew they wouldn't be fantastic because of their price but I expected them to be a little higher quality than what I got. It's a little annoying how bad the sound is coming out of these. It sounds like a way scaled up version of my macbook pro's internal speakers.They aren't the worst I've ever heard, but I do wish I had just paid $50 more for something nicer."
1257,I bought this item so that I could connect a USB video game controller to my phone to use with the -oid emulators.  It didn't work at all.  What I should have bought was a Micro USB to USB OTG (on the Go) adapter.  Ooops!
1258,This earclip headphones didnt press the ears so the sound wasnt as loud as I like. Good for little kids if you are concerned about exposing them to loud headphones. Not any bass that I could hear. Had to hold them close to my ears to really hear the music since I like it loud. Light-weight and fairly easy to place the clip on around the ears. Good price. Arrived fast from Company A - love shopping with them.
1259,"My office bought this headset for me (from Company A) so I could use it with both their VOIP software as well as with my desk phone.  I had been a long term (more than 5 years)Plantronics CS50 900 MHz Wireless Office Headset Systemuser who really liked the comfort and capabilities of the CS50, though my battery was starting to be short lived -- it was down to about 3 hours after 5 years of use).The good:* Setup was easy on both the desk phone and the computer.* Sound quality is great* Unit works at least twice as far as the CS50 (sometimes I roam around outside the house while on a call)* Battery life is great (more than 6 hours, though I am guessing that's somewhat related to how far you are away from the device).The bad:* Over the head band won't stay on my head unless I keep my head perfectly level (if I look down at something on my desk, it falls forward -- even when I have made the band tight to the point of being uncomfortable).  I think this is because there is no friction between the headband and the earpiece -- if you hold the headset by the band, the earpiece swings freely).* Mute operation sucks -- instead of a single quick on/off button, you have to hold the volume down button for a period of time (about 1.5 second - which sounds quick, but when you've already forgotten that you're on mute and nobody's hearing what you're saying and when you prematurely release the button sometimes, the others on your call start to think you've been dropped).* As some others have noted, the earpiece picks up noise any time it comes anywhere near your face and when you try to adjust it in the headband, it usually pops out and you're trying to put it back together in the middle of a call.* The earbud model of the earpiece is uncomfortable on long calls.  The on the ear cushion model of the CS50 was much more comfortable on those multi-hour conference calls.I much prefer the design, comfort and utility of the headset on the CS50 than I do the headset of this unit and wish there was an option to get the same headset for this base.  I feel that way strongly enough that I'm leaning towards using the CS50 for desk calls (the majority of my calls) and only using the Savi for VOIP calls which would be a waste of the product.UPDATE 7/27/12:  Exactly 2 years after putting this into service, the headset has suddenly (in the past 2 weeks) gone to dying after about 1.5 hours and seeming to get shorter every day.  Unfortunately, they *DO NOT* have a user replaceable battery in the headset -- this is a very big deal for a wireless headset that people usually get because they are on the phone for hours every day (otherwise why pay for an expensive headset).  Very unhappy that I have to go out and buy a $100 replacement headset to get my battery life back to normal.  For that reason I do NOT recommend getting this headset."
1260,"One of the speaker outputs stopped working the very first day. Before that happened, it sounded ok, for the price. The subwoofer was powerful, the speakers could have been a little louder. Returning it to Company A was easy and convenient, so I'm not too upset about it. I went with a shelf system instead."
1261,"The product sent was the right card, but it doesn't have the VGA plug or the slot bracket to fit it. It came with only the DVI and HDMI with a short bracket that wont even fit my computer. Seems I was shorted a few parts, especially your standard slot bracket. Geesh.At [...] they list what's in the box, but it doesn't say such parts, they show this: 900270 and 900290. I can only guess these are part numbers for the missing bracket and VGA plug. I only have VGA monitors (two). On my previous ATI card, I used an a DVI to VGA adapter and the VGA out to run two monitors. So when I seen the picture showing this card to have the same ability, I believed it to be true."
1262,"Acer is getting better designing their notebooks, they look sharp and perform decent.  I would say the new designs came from the merger with Gateway as Gateway laptops look damn fine.  ACer are making steps in the right direction with design, now all that lacks is better quality hardware."
1263,"I had this cord for about a year. This thing is terribly built. After about a month of the time I had it the top part broke almost breaking my flash. I placed it back with super glue and never had that happen again. After about 9 months later of light use ""maybe once a month"" the plastic part that holds to the shoe mount broke almost breaking my flash again. Will never risk on this happening again..I decided to go wireless instead and couldn't have made a better choice."
1264,"The spring that holds the speaker next to the ipod broke not long after using it.  The speaker still works fine, but the hinge now swings freely, so the speaker won't stay snug next to the iPod like it used to."
1265,"I won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned.  I would've given the iPad a 4 or 5 star except for the crippled Bluetooth.  The iPad CAN'T connect to a Bluetooth GPS nor your cellphone using dialup networking.  Why?  So you would buy a 3G version and pay monthly fees to AT&T instead.  Big BOO to Apple for putting AT&T ahead of it's customers.  Of course, if you have a cellphone that can act as a wifi router (like Win mobile, symbian with joikuspot, android 2.2) you can have the iPad use it, but this drains the battery significantly, unlike Bluetooth that can last the entire day."
1266,"My dream system of combing two 2TB drives containing all my home video, photographs, flac format ripped CD's and iso format movies is not to be achieved with this docking station. Attempted in vain to connect this KingWin to my Netgear's 3700 router's USB port and serve my whole house using Asus Oplay R3 Air's at each location. So I'm still searching.Note: my Samsung 2TB usb Story connects just fine to the router's usb port so I know its the chipset inside the KingWin which is need of a refresh."
1267,This is what results from sliding the red &#34;volume control&#34; switch:loudloudloudloudloudloudloudloudmuteIt is so loud at the lowest I can make it before it mutes that I have to hang my headphones an inch or two below my ears. I hoped this would solve the problem with our Samsung TV that offers no volume control when using headphones but it does not.
1268,"I bought this mouse two years ago.  I liked it, so I bought a second one a few months later to keep in my laptop bag.  It lasted about 1 year before the scroll wheel stopped working properly.  You can spin the wheel and it will roll, but it doesn't send the scrolling signal to the computer.  If you push down and roll at the same time, you can get it to work, but it often will &#34;click&#34; the wheel when you're just trying to roll it.  Since I had a second one, I swapped it out and the same thing happened to the less-used one at about the same one-year mark.  I won't buy another."
1269,"Very cheap, tele converter, should have known by the price. If your going to use this item more then once, I suggest you purchase a better one"
1270,"Bought this for use with watching Movies, TV, Netflix, playing Video Games, and as a make shift In-Ear Monitor.Pros- Simple set up- Good, not great, sound quality- Decent range- Great for listening to music without being tied downCons- Major latency/lag. In laymen's terms: if you watch a movie, the lips will be faster than the words. Unbearable.The one con was enough for me to return it. I got theAerielle i2i Wireless Digital Audio Device for iPod and MP3 Players (Black)instead. They aren't perfect, and they are more expensive. But there is NO lag at all. Where I use it has a lot of interference so I have to have them in near line of sight to work. But i'd rather deal with that than lag."
1271,"This blu-Ray player basically does the primary job of playing a blu-Ray disc. However, it has a host of problems. Summary:Pros:- Plays blu-ray discs- Easy firmware updates via Ethernet connection- Looks nice- Decent remoteCons:- Frequent loud pops through receiver when player is idle- Very loud noise through surround speakers once or twice (scared the pants off me)- Only sits on pause for a short time before shutting off- If it shuts off by itself, it resets my Samsung tv to the Cable input (which I don't use)- Audio and video get out of synch on Netflix instant watch (have very fast Internet connection and does not happen on pc)These problems were enough to make me return it. They were unendurable. If you want the Netflix instant watch feature, perhaps try the LG models instead."
1272,"I ordered the Seagate 4 TB storage solution because I have space issues on my computer.  I've been trying to find the right backup solution for some time now and have filled a couple of external hard drives seeking the right answer.  When I saw this 4 TB solution it looked ideal.  Now, I'm disappointed....First of all, if you are considering this as a storage solution, that's fine but remember that its network and its slow.  Several of my programs (Norton for example) failed to recognize the network storage solution.  The application that came with the computer seems to work.  It took 4 days to 'backup' my hard drive but I can't tell what was backed up and how. Second, the drive itself doesn't seem to be well recognized by my Windows software.  There's separate applications to use to access the drive but those applications seem to have really slowed my system down.Third, I will point out that the drive does seem to work...I got green across its indicators and I can tell that its been working hard.  That would have gotten it 4 stars alone but because I can't tell what was backed up or seem to even effectively access the drive, I dropped a star.I dropped another star because when I tried to contact the manufacturer to get help, I couldn't get it.  They're there if I want to pay.  I'm not asking for ongoing support, I simply cannot seem to effectively install their product.  I've followed the directions carefully, went online to discussion groups, etc.  They lost another star because I can't seem to get them to help me install and use their product.If you are looking for a solution and you are a network expert, I expect this will suit you. If you are not an expert, I would suggest you look onward."
1273,"I looked up my order and it was July 2010 for $7.50 plus $5.50 shipping. This item worked for almost three years, recently gave up the ghost suddenly.  I tried three different monitors and a TV and a different New MB Air.I have one word for anyone reading this.  The word is: monopriceI ordered this before I knew about that word.  If you don't know, now you know...."
1274,"I use this with my Mac desktop.When it worked:The size took a little getting used to, but I like the fit, and my elbow hasn't gotten numb or tingly anymore since I started using it.  I have a wide hand and now I'm more apt to use a touchpad before I'll use a mini mouse on my laptop.Battery life seems fine.  (It has an Eneloop battery inside.)  The thing is, when the battery needs charging I just plug it in and continue using it, so I don't really even notice how often I need to do that.  The charging lights on top are helpful.Left button problem:Very disappointing.  Just over a year after I bought it, I can't click and drag.  It ""stutters"" and skips.  I took it apart to clean it with compressed air but that didn't help.  Definitely not worth $60 if it only lasts about a year.Fixed?Maybe.  I took it apart again and tinkered with the copper spring in the microswitch (see tutorial in iFixit).  I feel more tension in the left button now, but we'll have to see if that does the trick.  Next time (and there will be a next time) there are a couple of other fixes I might try first, because that fiddley little spring was a pain to reseat!  But I hope the hour I invested in fixing it bought me at least another year out of this mouse.Here's what I'll try next time it starts to malfunction:Blowing under the left button with warm, moist air (i. e. my breath).  Costs nothing, takes a second to do.  The theory is that it will help dissipate any electrostatic charge built up on the plastic parts.  Next, I'll try removing the battery and alternating pressing the left and right buttons to get the capacitors to discharge.  (Actually, I wonder if this may be what really fixed my mouse-- all the handling I did with it may have had the same effect.)  Lastly, I might buy another Omicron microswitch and simply swap it out (but will require soldiering).  You can buy a bunch of the microswitches pretty inexpensively on ebay."
1275,"After reading all the positive reviews on this site for this iPod dock, I decided to give it a try.As soon as I started listening to this dock, I was immediately unimpressed.  First off, it sounds better if you are above it, since the dock is at an angle.  Sitting directly across from it yields absolutely zero base and a very tinny sound.  So having it sit on my desk where it is just slightly below ear level does not work at all.  If I stood up so the dock was about waist high, that helped a little bit, some of the base sound did come through, but it was still unsatisfying.  I thought if I moved the handle to a position that allowed the speakers to be at 90 degrees that would solve a bit of the lack of bass problem, however, this causes the iPhone/iPod to lean forward to the point where it's almost falling out of its dock. This idea left too much risk to breakage of the device.The remote works reasonably well for controlling the album/artist selections on the iPhone (I used an iPhone 4).  However, at more than 6' range, the remote is no longer responsive.The unit is nice and compact, has a stow away spot for the remote control in the back for easy portability, and I found that the radio got reasonable receiption. I can't attest to the life of the batter, since after about 30 minutes of listening to this I packed it back up and sent it back to Company A.I don't know if this is the sound quality to expect from a $100 range dock, but if so then I'm going to need to bump up my budget a little, because the sound quality was horrible on this stereo.  Almost no base, way too much mid range and tinny high notes.  I listen to rock/metal music, and this (to be blunt) sounded like crap!  I'm not extremely picky and wasn't looking for something to compete with a $300-$400 system such as a Bose, I just wanted something for my office that would let me enjoy music at a low volume.  I don't understand how so many people praise the sound quality of this device.  At least Company A has a good return policy."
1276,"I bought this stand for some portrait photos and placed an 8.5ft wide backdrop on it. The poles are very small and wimpy and not intended to hold much weight. Especially when the backdrop is hoisted as tall as it goes, it can become unstable. The flash equipment that I had rented with this stand had stronger poles than these... I would return if I could. All the same, it did do the job."
1277,"I wish this was built better because if you put it on your windshield and *never* touch it again, it works great.  I like the stiffness of the neck and the ability to rotate from portrait to landscape.  HOWEVER, the first one I owned broke when I tried to remove it from the windshield.  The part that breaks is a small piece inside the suction mechanism that allows you to ""lock"" the ultra-strong suction into place.  Once it's broken, you can stick it on something but it will rattle and eventually fall off.I notified the manufacturer and they replaced the broken unit under warranty (it took a while to receive the new one.)I was excited that they replaced it, but only three weeks later the exact same thing happened to my replacement unit, and that was with me already knowing to be careful with the lock mechanism!  It simply doesn't take much effort to break the tiny piece inside and there is no way to access it for DIY repair.  Once it's broken, the product is immediately useless.  This is a design flaw and unfortunately I cannot recommend this product to anyone until it's fixed because there are no workarounds."
1278,only 4 inputs worked so its not really a 5x1. Also the Led lights on the front of the unit are extemely bright.
1279,Does it play media files?  YesIs it worth paying extra just to flash the Apple Logo? Nope!Nothing special here.  Move along.
1280,"like many others have said, they've turned the Nano into a shuffle with a touchscreen.  In the process they dropped a lot of features that made the Nano attractive.  The camera, the click wheel, video support.  One of Apple's worst missteps in a while."
1281,"Likes:  1) The size of the box.  2) The large size of the screen's font. 3) Sound is decent.What I do not like:  1) The glossy color shows fingerprints and smudges.  2) At night the numbers are way too dim if I set to auto-dim.  If I set dimness manually, the setting that is good for the day is too bright at night.  3) Now onto the big stuff - unreliable alarm.  If I must have an alarm these days, I use my cell phone, as sometimes the radio does not activate.  4) When I go to turn on the radio, it will not play the last station.  I have to go back a step or two.  For example, if I was listening to a local radio station and then turned off the radio, when I turn it back on, I have to use the back button to go to ""Local"" and then re-pick the actual station.  5) Oftentimes the radio cannot connect to my wireless router.  It is the only wireless device that has this problem.  I have a TIVO, a Samsung Blueray, an Apple notebook, an IPhone - all have no problem hooking up to my wireless router and staying hooked up!  Not this radio, it often says it cannot find my wireless router.  6)  If my computer is sleeping or off, this radio cannot do anything.  Also it takes a long time to tell me it cannot connect to my server.This radio is much too complicated and fraught with bugs to be worth much more of my time.  As another reviewer said, ""for what this device costs, it simply doesn't produce.""Update as of Jan 2011.  This product continues to disappoint.  In the last month, I have lost the ability to listen to internet radio - the primary reason I bought this radio.  I have to download the same software update to make internet radio show up as a choice.  This has happened twice.  Also, I select a particular radio station and it actually plays a different station, while telling me it is the one I wanted.  Very buggy.I am now looking for another radio that is more dependable and easier to use."
1282,"I've had this for a few months now, and it has become less and less reliable with each passing day. In fact, I was just listening to music as I was browsing Company A, and suddenly the music stopped and the machine froze, prompting me to write this review. Logitech has horrible customer service, something I learned from owning several of their Harmony remotes. I don't expect any of the issues reported in the reviews of this device to be resolved. Avoid purchasing this product."
1283,"These are being sold out at Costco, which is where mine went back to.They are comfortable to wear, but as soon as I tried them I noticed that there was no high end. Cymbals, for one example didn't have the shimmer that they have in real life, or from good phones.I thought maybe my ears had gone bad, so I compared to a few other headphones I had around my house. Nope, it wasn't my ears - these are completely lacking in the upper end.Recently, I happened to be in a local Best Buy, where there was a shelf demo unit with the newer OE2, and the AE2 (these go around the ear). Comparing them (with Bose's custom show-off music) showed the same result - the newer OE2s were flat compared to the AE2s.I presume Bose has been around long enough to know what they are doing and this is intentional. But they don't work for me.."
1284,"Does what it's supposed to. In a distant upstairs bedroom, my wireless signal increased from 1-2 bars to 4. I got to ""excellent signal strength.""But the setup process was hell. The setup disc was useless, yielding nothing more than a ""Site survey failed"" alert. Here's a link to the support page. You'll need it: [...]Online chat with Linksys eventually solved the problem, but took a couple hours. The fix in my case, which I NEVER would have guessed, was to link to the range extender with an Ethernet cable, access the setup screen and manually make sure the IP address, SSID, and gateway settings are filled in. Then, on the security settings page, enter your network password  not in the ""passcode"" field, but in the field below it. Plug-n-play? No way!"
1285,"Pros:1. The screen is huge and allows you to see tons of data in one view.2. The routing tends to work quite well.3. The maps seem up-to-date.  While it didn't route to my house properly, nothing does as I live way out in the country on dirt roads.  That said, it got closer than other units I've seen.Cons:1. The voice recognition system.  First, you can't quickly navigate it as you have to wait for it to bring it up then prompt you to speak.  Second, the voice recognition is very poor at recognizing names.  It couldn't even get road names like River or Bell.2. The battery life is virtually non-existent so make sure you can keep it on a charger all the time.3. After a few weeks of use, my unit wouldn't power on when I got in the car.  I'd have to fiddle with it for a while and, usually, it'd boot up but would warn me about a low battery and such.  I checked the power conenctions and all was fine.4. Tech support is poor and rude.  I called Motorola support regarding the issue with powering the system on and they told me that it might be defective and that I'd have to ship it to them to evaluate it and decide what they'd do with it.  They said that, if they determined that it wasn't defective, they'd charge me for evaluating the unit.  On top of that, they wouldn't even offer an advanced exchange option so I was going to have to go for a few weeks without it.I ended up returning this unit to Company A and ordering the new Garmin Nuvi that isn't even out yet."
1286,"When it worked, it sounded decent; much better than the one which came with the ipod.  I've had two pairs of these earphones and they are both broken.  The first one lasted about 6 months and then the left earbud started shorting out and went dead.  Purchased another set and after 3 months, it's shorting out again; this time at the end of the jack plug. These earphones are okay for the price but don't expect it to last.  I'll be looking for new earphones from another manufacturer, I suggest you do the same.  Move along, nothing to see."
1287,My main gripes about this MP3 player is that its FM tuner is mediocre with oftentimes too much static and that its battery is short-lived to require frequent recharging without warning.  I've been caught &#34;short&#34; too often and had to &#34;suffer silence.&#34;  ;-(
1288,"I wasn't impressed by this adaptor. The input isn't constructed to hold a 3.5mm plug straight. The inside if the chamber is hollow so with very little effort I could push the 3.5mm plug out of alignment. Not the kind of stable connection you normally want for your audio equipment, but maybe I shouldn't have expected better for the price."
1289,"You cannot control the clock video screen from the Sony controls..you dock the ipod and then use the ipod to control things.  This is really a kludge on such an expensive device.The video is horribly cropped.  At least 15%-20% of the top of the screen is GONE.  There is no way around this, the fit to screen option SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK.  It appears it takes the last orientation of the iPod to scale...if you landscape (turn sidewise), then immediately dock the iPod, less of the clock screen display is cropped.  This is, however, the ruin of this unit...at this price the video screen is the main selling point, and it works poorly.DO NOT buy this thinking you will be able to do what they advertised.  This was rushed to market, missing key elements of ipod touch or iphone control.  There are no video functions for contrast, etc.  The screen fit functions do not work.What a remarkably poor effort by Sony!"
1290,"I bought this mini laptop two months ago for accessing my e-mail primarily. About a week ago, I installed Window Words XP onto this netbook because I need to take it to the library to do some research. I then discovered the cursor would jump to a different part of the document while I was typing, sometimes it would even highlight an entire paragraphy and then deleted it in a flash. It was extremely irritating, thank god there was the ""UNDO"" in the EDIT toolbar.To make the story short, I called Toshiba Tech support three times and each time they told me how to fix it, and it failed: (1) Turn off the computer, unplugged the battery, hold the power button for 15 seconds to reset the computer; (2) To unistall the Window Words XP, then reinstall it; (3) To reformat the entire hard drive to factory setting. Of all the remedies, the last step was the most drastic and time-consuming because it took more than 2 hours to reformat the hard drive, plus however long it took to reinstall other softwares.As I said earlier, none of the remedies recommended by the Toshiba Tech support worked. If you were near me after the hard drive was reformatted and the problem was still unsolved, you could see steam coming out of my head.I then took the matter into my own hand, and did some research on the internet to find out what caused the cursor jumps around in laptop computers. Apparently, this is a very very common problem in a lot of laptops made by different brands. Some of it is related to hardware glitch, some of it is related to softwares, and some of it is related to something that is still not known.For this netbook computer, because the keyboard is very small and the motion-sensitve touch pad is so nearby, it might pick up motions from keystrokes and cause the cursor to malfunction. I took the solution recommended by some bloggers who had this problem before: to turn off the touch pad completely, and plugged in a USB wireless mouse. Luckily, Window 7 has an option in the Control Panel/Hardware/Mouse/Advance which allows the users to disable the touch pad when a wireless mouse is plugged in. Guess what? the problem of the cursor jumped around stopped completely after I chose this option and plugged in a wirless mouse.I then called Toshiba Tech Support, wanting to share this piece of information/solution with them. The supervisor, whom talked with a heavy latino accent, was extremely impatient and rude. For one thing, she kept mispronunced my name even after I corrected her each time, ""all-ton"" and not ""owl-ton"". Also, as I was about to tell her how I fixed the problem, she thanked me and wanted to terminated the conversation. I told her I wasn't finished, she then said something which was completely unrelated, ""If you are unhappy about Toshiba products, I can authorize you a return to have our people fix your computer."" I hanged up immediately, who needed to speak to Moron like that.For those of you who want to buy this computer, think twice!!!! If you can put up with the cursor jumping around, and/or a Tech Support that is based at who knows where, go ahead!"
1291,"I gave up once the second one they sent didn't work. The seller was great, no issues when I needed to return the first one. As far as the product, I could never get it to work. Due to it's relatively low price, I took the chance and it didn't pan out. That's life. Two stars because the seller is easy to work with."
1292,Broke during the first use. This isn't rocket science. They should be able to do a LOT better than this.
1293,"I was looking forward to receiving this portable TV, but it turned out to be a disappointing purchase.  I wanted it for multiple uses: to use in two rooms that don't have a cable outlets and to use during emergencies.In addition to built-in antenna (based on reviews of other people) I also purchased Terk AntennaTerk Technology HDTVi VHF/UHF HDTV Indoor Antenna.  However, downstairs I get no stations with built-in antenna and only 2 stations with the Terk Antenna.  Upstairs I can get 3 channels with Terk Antenna ( NBC, ABC and PBS. I am missing CBS).  If I connect the TV to a cable outlet it finds all the stations, but I don't need it in the rooms that I have an cable outlet.Other problems:* With antenna attached the unit is not portable (see picture), the cables are relative short and the antenna is huge.* The antenna does not have a stable base, so it has to be on a very firm leveled area.* The connection to the antenna is very bad, it falls out out of the TV easily.  This is due to the design of the outlet in the TV. I purchased several connectors and none o them have a good fit.* There is no way to turn on or turn off the unit using the remote control. Because the antenna is unstable and has to be located a flat surface and TV is attached to it by a cable, I can't easily reach the TV to turn it on and off. I have to get up and walk up to it.  Annoying!I don't recommend this product."
1294,"These were a gift. After closer inspection it was reviled the headphones are fake. At first I thought maybe Monster was just over rated, but then it was brought to my attention they were a fraud. My Apple headphones that came with an old iPhone 4 sound better. Currently these are sitting in a drawer...a reminder of people that tell lies on Company A. Seems to be getting worse. Maybe Company A will get a grip on this soon. Very displeased."
1295,Windows was ok except the update system for windows wouldn't work I called Microsoft and had a guy do everything he could to fix it however that didn't work.

1296,"I bought this hard drive in February 2010 to store pictures on. Did a long format with no problems, which some people recommend to test a drive. Then partitioned it into two drives, and put a bunch of pictures on one of the partitions with no problem. Turned off the system for the night, and the next day the computer could not access the partition with the pictures and said it needed to be reformated, causing me to lose the pictures. Which were not heirlooms or anything so I had not backed the up elsewhere. Was going to do that when the partition died.  Decided I did not trust the ability of this drive to handle partitions and combined them into one drive. Started using the drive for the Windows automatic backup, and it worked fine for over a year, but a month ago the drive started to cause an Explorer crash whenever I used it, and then Windows would not recognize it and said it needed formatting again, which I did. And it is working fine again, but I am now shopping for yet another hard drive, which will be a different brand.  I have another Western Digital 1T drive which is older, and that one has always worked fine, but this one has soured me on the brand."

1304,"This is a good low cost no frills USB drive to help get files from A to B.It does this job just fine.If feels a bit cheapy, very light no cap or retracting usb connector but those things are not needed for its function.The bit issue is the fact that this is one of the new &#34;Windows 8 Certified&#34; USB drives from SanDisk that has changed how the storage is detected by your computer.It WILL NOT show up as &#34;removable storage&#34; but instead as a &#34;Local Disk&#34; to this extent you can still move files from A to B just fine, but if your in need of making this a boot device there are many (most) programs that will only detected &#34;removable storage&#34; as a device to format and install programs and boot media onto it.I work in the IT industry and I purchased this to make a bootable device for portable windows, and emergency boot tools and I can not do this since all my programs only allow me to use removable storage for the process.So this device was retired from being a really great tool to just a file storage device.If thats what you need go for it, if your into IT or may want to use this to boot programs you better find a brand that is not doing this or at least offers you a tool that allows you to &#34;flip the bit&#34; that tells your operating system what type of storage it is.Id sent it back if it was not more trouble than what its worth.SanDisk needs to get with the program and get a tool out to switch these back and forth between storage device type like other companies have done, and from what I read on the forums SanDisk is aware of the issue and complaints and publicly stated they have no intention of bringing us (the customers) this capability.So as a long time SanDisk customer, I say goodbye!"
1305,"8000 watts output with a 15 amp, 110 volt plug?  110 volts*15 amps=1650 watts (at 100% efficiency) What does this mean? You don't need to plug this in, it's a power generator.  You can plug appliances into it and get 6000 watts of free power and a thumping sound system!  While running at full power, you can run three hair dryers, or twenty 50 inch lcd televisions, or one-hundred 60 watt incandescent light bulbs, or 500 sixty-watt equivalent compact fluorescent light bulbs.  But this and the energy crisis is over!"
1306,"This Zune sound dock was an unfortunate disappointment, severely lacking in basic functionality.  A sound dock of any kind should be good in sound, features and convenience.  I'll break down my experiences:The Sound-------------1. Volume adjusts from 1 to 30, but is barely audible under 11.  In fact, 18 seems like a quiet whisper volume.  Over volume 24, I could tell there was sound distortion and at 30 well, it was overpowering the speakers I thought I would break it. I'm relistening to it at volume 22 and it's not very loud and you can almost hear a static sound reproduction on a new Lady Gaga MP3.  I chose various Genres of music (classical to hip hop to pop to rock) with different songs to determine the ""loudness"" acceptable levels.2. Bass was a bit ""poppy"" sounding as if there was no real bass, I'm not expecting a subwoofer thump, but for a company who specializes in sound, I wasn't impressed.  I have Altec computer speakers that sound FAR better.The Features--------------1. It says it has HD Radio, but in fine print, it doesn't have HD radio, the Zune HD has HD radio and you happen to hear the sound from the Zune2. It DOES have FM radio, which is actually a useless feature, because all Zunes (1st to 3rd generation) have FM radios3. I was shocked to find it has no clock function at all like other sound docks do.  I mean, let's think about this, you can get a simple LED clock with alarm from Walmart for a few dollars - they couldn't have at least put a clock and alarm in this so I could put this on my nightstand and wake up to my Zune music, etc ?4. Most people's nightstands aren't all that big in size, there's no room for this sound dock, plus my current clock radio.5. The included remote and ""integrated remote-holder"" works for volume but won't control the Zune!  See convenience section:The Convenience-----------------1. This is the dumbest part of this sound dock.  The included remote won't control any of the music functions of the Zune beyond Next, Previous and Pause.  So let's say you've taken this to the patio and your friends complain they don't like the playlist you're on, well you have to undock the Zune, choose your playlist manually, and re-dock it.  For people like me, I like diverse genres of music plus some audiobooks, so simply putting your *entire* collection on shuffle is not an option (unless you're prepared to hit ""Next"" after every other song).  So this sound dock really scores bad on convenience.2. Here's the next dumb part of this sound dock - it doesn't even transmit signals using the original Zune remote!  So fine, maybe the included remote doesn't control the Zune, but at least allow it to use the Zune remote, nope won't work.Summary and Areas for Improvement-----------------------------------1. No clock radio/alarm - this would be a huge improvement!2. Shuffle your Entire Music Collection or nothing - the included remote nor the Zune remote won't control any music functions beyond Play/Pause or Next/Previous - that's it...no remote control choosing of playlists or other music, etc.  (Ie.  Lets say you put this on the deck for a party, having a remote in your lawn chair to control different music sure would be nice, wouldn't it?)3. Volume is barely audible under 11 on a scale of 1 to 30 and 18 is a casual whisper, yet volume 24 to 30 the sound already distorts4. Bass is ""poppy"" at times5. A sound dock needs good sound, common-sense features, and to be convenient - it severely lacks in these areas as described above."
1307,"I have an old Athlon XP 3200+ on an nForce2 motherboard.  The driver installation was a little tricky (had to install the CD drivers first before the most current Catalyst 12.6 Hotfix drivers would install).  Wasn't too difficult though.  The card just didn't work well with my PC.  From start up to loading programs to shut down everything seemed bogged down by the card/drivers and would take easily twice as long.  I played Torchlight with it and the game was very choppy and during big fight scenes the game would drop into the single digits (FPS) and freeze momentarily.  I cleaned all the old drivers out and reinstalled my X850 XT AGP with the legacy 10.2 drivers.  The game was perfectly smooth and the computer was behaving normally again.  Basically, there's just something about this PCI-E to AGP adapted card that doesn't agree with my old computer.  An Athlon XP system is pretty common and I would think these AMD/ATI AGP cards with the Rialto bridge chips would be optimized for them (even considering their age).  I don't think they're optimized for anything to be honest.  The old native AGP X850 XT runs rings around the HD 4650 (and it shouldn't)."
1308,"We wanted to use this to see our pets when we were on vacation.  Unfortunately, we could never get the wi fi to work.  Customer service was great, but even they couldn't get it to work.  They told me to get a new one.  Didn't have time, so ended up buying a 25 foot cable.Secondly, after 8 million tries - still can't get the email notification to work.  Again, great customer service, but no luck getting this function to work.So basically all I get is a screen shot of my living room.Will be returning this."
1309,"Cooling is okay, but the size of this baby is too much. Also, having to take out the motherboard to mount is is a royal pain...might as well build a new PC. And, if you ever want to clean the fans, forget about it! You'll be back to removing the motherboard because the clips holding the fans are a pain in the arss to remove/replace. I replaced these with Scythe Samurai ZZ's and they are MUCH better (with a much easy top-mounting system)."
1310,"Pros:CheapEasy to setupNot that bad of quality (in terms of sound quality) for priceCons:The left speaker has already broken. Never moved it, yet it doesn't work now - no sound.There's always a ""fuzzy"" noise. You basically have to keep the volume on the speaker itself kind of low, and then raise your computer volume high to avoid the fuzz getting any louder.I wouldn't buy these again. I'd rather pay a little more for quality speakers than buy something that's going to just break on me. Waste of money!"
1311,"I ordered 2 of these for my kids machines.  I figured hey cheap cards cant be to bad.  I was wrong, the cards had several issues being recognized by the machines. After which i spent about an hour or so manually choosing the drivers.I was able to get them to work and the sound quality was decent, but I will say if you dont have the time or the want to mess around with them move on to something a little better out in the market."
1312,"This very sleek charger for the iPhone looks far better than how it performed. To be fair, I never had a chance to use it due to the fact that it is designed too short to reach the elements of my 12-Volt socket in my Suzuki 4x4. Ultimately, I had to send it back. If it is extended and redesigned for just that, I am sure it would work as well as it looks. I had read other reviews prior to my purchasing the charger and many had the same result, however, I always have to try it for myself and is what I found as well."
1313,Can't complain too much since the item was so cheap but it saw only 1 day of action before going into storage.  Compared to my Pentax DSLR kit strap not only is this shoulder portion very wide but it is very thick.  The straps that go thru the camera hoops are too wide so you need to force them thru.  You do get what you pay for... Oh well.
1314,"You would think this would be a easy product to make right but no. They lock on to each other so tight, you will end up tossing a few in the trash. It feels like they are rusty when you put them on your lens. They seem to be painted and the flakes get everywhere as they wear off. Your lens will end up dirty. You can risk it if you like."
1315,"I don't use this much, but somehow the part that holds the top & bottom together when you twist, seems to have broken off. ...not sure how...but now it won't &#34;collapse&#34;...The sound is tinny and now that it is broken, I don't use it."
1316,"Thought I was getting something good here until I got it setup and realized that I was just as well off without it.  I mean come on, this is suppose to be a high quality product.  I understand that in no way this is suppose to sound as good as surround sound but it should have a slight improvement over my tv speakers.  I ended up just giving it away to someone only because there tv speakers didn't work.Pros -Looks goodEasy to set upReceiver has built in subCons -Sub woofer is not any goodLacks any good settings or featuresSounds worse than tv speakersOverpricedVery buggy sometimes"
1317,i did like this case a first but after awhile when i put it down and went on vacation i came back and some of the red coloring came off and was imbedded into my desk....took me forever to remove the coloring
1318,Does not work with my xbox 360 and panasonic tv:( I could care less about a refund or exchange. I wanted working cables the first time.
1319,"Review of Virgin Mobile Broadband To Go Wireless USB AdapterMy wife and I purchased this device so she could keep on top of her business while we traveled through the Western US during a recent vacation. We were in Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and Nevada. We used this device on two computers, one running Windows 7, and the other running Windows XP. We used the device for one month, with the unlimited data plan, during which our total download amount was about 2GB (at least that's what the device web page stated).Pros:o On a good day, it works reasonably well, giving download speeds of approximately 150 kbps.o Unlimited data plan is a nice idea, and a reasonable price (if it worked).Cons:o Speed / performance is highly variable and independent of signal strength. We often experienced very sluggish performance, many times in areas with good signal strength. The response on many occasions was so slow it was essentially impossible to use for simple web surfing.o Software is rather awkward and confusing to set up initially.o Software is somewhat buggy during day to day operation. It often takes more than one try to make it work correctly (a ""try"" meaning either removing and re-inserting the adapter, or rebooting the computer with the adapter in, or out - usually one of these will get the thing to recognize the device and make a connection.)Summary:Not recommended.One wonders about the honesty of Virgin Mobile. Although there is no way for me to prove it, I strongly suspect the company routinely throttles down the performance of the device, perhaps because they have sold more unlimited data plans than there network is capable of servicing."
1320,"It started out doing OK.  The sound was decent.  Then I started to notice some crackling in my speakers during play.  Originally I thought it was just my car (XC90).  However, I have since tried it on a few rental cars I've had and have experienced the same problem (ie, eliminating my personal car is the only test subject).  So given that I've experienced the same crackling problem on a variety of vehicles I'm left to assume the product isn't that great.  Wish I had better news."
1321,"Alright, I love the features and you can't beat the price.  Everyone has said that and it's true.The interface is tragic though.  It's clunky, scattered, unintuitive, and all in all seems pretty poorly thought out.  Poorly in the sense that any middle school kid could have come up with a better interface.  Options are scattered, and you can't do anything else while streaming A2DP bluetooth music.  You can't even turn the screen off like you can for every other input.  You can't change the color of the button lights like you can on some basic receivers, so if you don't like a nice pure blue, don't bother.  The screen is resistive, but still fairly responsive, so that's good; and the buttons are big, so that's good too.  I would recommend bumping up to a higher model just to avoid the UI, or at least waiting until a later model with an interface that makes the least bit of sense.Update:  I'm reducing the review to 2 stars as my bluetooth just stopped working on this unit.  It says it's connected, but there's no audio.  It just stopped spontaneously."
1322,"This looked like such a great idea. A good sized tote - about the width of two grocery bags - to keep items in your trunk from rolling around.It has handles, it made of strong canvas and has a non-slip bottom. I have a car trash can that is made out of the same materials, that I've had for 10 years and it's still in great shape.The big problem is opening it. I tried for quite a while, then had my son who is the 'fixer' around our house. Neither of us could get it to stay open. Finally I went onto the Company A review page, which I normally don't do before I write a review and there were some great suggestions about how to get it to stay open. You have to push the handles really hard to get them to slip behind the arrows and then the tote will stay open. It worked but completely smashed my fingernail, not just the tip but halfway down the nail bed - ouch!It's very nice now that it's open but I wouldn't buy it expecting to fold it down for storage and when you do open it - be careful!"
1323,"I already own one of these monitors and I bought another one to match it.  To my dismay, when I rotated it into portrait mode, the viewing angle became messed up.  The colors change, and there's a weird gradient on the screen caused by the difference in viewing angle between your left and right eye.  It can be a problem because it causes eye strain with text (like if you're studying/working on the computer for many hours a day) or if you're doing graphics work, because the colors are totally skewed.  If I do graphics work, I have to drag the image to my other monitor to check the colors, and when I'm studying, I only leave reference material on that monitor and I only need to glance at.  The monitor also stopped working after 6 months. The monitor is fine if you leave it in landscape mode.Looking for a new, and different, monitor now."
1324,"Just purchased this to replace the original power cord/charger for my 3 1/2 year old Company B 1520. That one lasted a long time but is now all taped up...still works if the tape doesn't move!  This new unit's specs are the same as the original, and marked with the Midnight name and trademark.  Only physical difference is this one is a 3-prong plug, vs. the 2-prong on the original.  Powers the laptop fine.  I ran it on the battery down to 80% charge to test the  ability to charge, and it charged the laptop completely normally in about 10 minutes.  Great find given that it's less than half of what Midnight charges.  Will update this review in a few months to remark on its longevity/durability.Update - August 12, 2011Have now had this AC adapter-charger for 4 months and it's crapped out.  Will still give me AC power but will not charge laptop.  Laptop recognized the problem and started giving me error messages saying it wasn't recognizing the adapter and wasn't getting at least 60V [this is a 90V adapter].  I can see the insulation around the plug is worn around a juncture and there's exposed wire.So if my original one lasted 3.5 years and this one lasted 4 months, I can't really make the case that it's not worth the extra money to buy from Midnight.  Only problem is that this unit says it's original Midnight equipment."
1325,"Would have earned 4 stars except for three issues (1) Lists are difficult to manage - they do not transfer over from Windows Media Player and laborious to build on the device(2) Earphones broke after a month and, most importantly, (3) operating system was accidently deleted (common issue per Internet postings) and Coby never replied to several emails asking for help to restore."
1326,"I had a gx 650 that ran well for about 6 months at about 3hrs/day then died. I use a core i-7, eah 5770, and haf 932 case. My daily avg. ambient t is about 30+ Deg C outside of the USA. After reading the the reviews on johhnyguru.com now I know why. It seems that all or most of the gx series can only handle ambient t at about 25deg C. So, if you are not living in the far northern or southern part of the equator, or have a room ambient t of 25 deg c or less, then you better look for a better psu. A 5 yr. warranty is great until you actually have to use it and then wait for your psu to be fixed. There is no peace of mind here in having this warranty, rather it's a great marketing trick."
1327,"So I got this bag initially when I had my plastic body Canon XSi and plastic based kit lenses (like the 18-55mm and 55-250mm lens).  You can fit all this gear in there and even the flash and its cords/chargers etc and its not that bad with the single strap on your shoulder.Well I got rid of that camera and moved upto the 7d and got some better lenses.  One of them is the 24-70L lens.  Just putting that camera and lens in there made the bad weigh at least 3-5lbs more to me.  This is where the SINGLE strap concept just isnt going to cut it.  After taking this on a 2week trip to India traveling and shooting, my shoulder was constantly killing me after 30mins because all the weight is on that one shoulder.So for anything thats a metal like body camera and metal body lenses that have weight, Id steer away from this single strap bag and stick with a two strap shoulder concept (like a standard backpack) to save your shoulders.Dixit"
1328,"I have never successfully gotten through a Blu-ray on this device.  They always freeze or lock up the device, sometimes even causing it to turn off!  It's extremely annoying because then you have to watch the previews again before you can fast forward to where you left off in the movie.  It does great for Netflix, but terrible on Blu-rays and DVDs."
1329,It seems like a lot of companies try to weasel out of the rebate.. Powercolor is one. Purchased on Black Friday 2013.. I was just sent an email (after 2 inquiries) stating my check was being processed (4-4-14) can you say ..FILTH. Asus has tried pulling the same crap. From now on I am going to ignore the rebate (weasel) price. If it listed for $100 w/$20 rebate I will buy it when it hits $80 dollars. Scum must think our time is worthless....can you say out of business soon weasels
1330,"This is my first review on Company A, really. I am doing it because I am so disappointed with this product. From the moment you touch it it feels very cheap. The zipper is the cheapest available, the straps are uncomfortable and are hooked to the sides of the bag in the center, which means once you have your camera in it it tilts and your hip hits the upper edge of the bag. Uncomfortable. The ""suspension system"" is an interesting idea, and this product gets two stars rather than one due to that.Also, it takes too much time to get the camera in and out, and if you have straps attached to the camera (you should!) you need to push them in -- no natural place for them. I was using it for a couple of hours with my canon 60D and hated every moment. Returning it now as we speak."
1331,"It's great with a very short lens and no grip, no tripod mount, but too tight with even the smallest accesory."
1332,Feels good but the mic would not work and the green is not a mint it is more of a ugly emerald green. The part with the mic and controls was lifted on mine. I sent them back.
1333,"When the box works, it does a decent enough job.There are some glitches in the basic functionality;AnnoyingWhen the screen saver comes on, if you click the remote sometimes the screen doesn't repaint, but is stillthere awaiting your input (Netflix application is where I'm seeing it).  If you just keep maddeningly clickingthe remote, that generally gets the devices' attention.Rubbish;The browser, no idea what is going on here, but if from the main menu you type in a URL, it -will- take you to theinitial site (Company A for instance, but there were a couple of others that I tried), after that if you click on a linkon the page (Company A streaming being the most annoying one), you get the very generic message ""page not found"".I thought, well, I have playon, I'll use that to get the Company A content that I've paid for as well as the prime streaming.You can actually in theory do that via going into the set up section for file shares.  Tried it, the thing nevercame back.  I think it may have been an issue with it scanning the file system, trying to make a list of media.Guessing, gave up after 2-3 minutes and rebooted the device).Don't get it;You see requests for an Company A streaming app on both the Boxee site as well as the Company A site, but absolutely noresponse on either site from either company.  Part of which is the reason I'm giving this thing such a craprating.  Support / responsiveness of the vendor rates very high in my book.Goodness;I'm using AT&T; Uverse and netflix streaming is excellent.A good selection of other ""things"" from the internet.Use it to cut off your cable?Not likelyThere certainly is a lot of content out on the Internet, but a lot of it is more ""bait and switch"", instead of fullepisodes, some of the sites put up clips of episodes and point you back to their main site.  A lot of content ishomegrown, which isn't in and of itself bad, but it's a very fragmented experience.  If you're using to sittingback and mindlessly clicking the remote until you find something you like, forget about it.  Review all the sites,review the list of stuff on the site, play whatever it is and hope that it lasts for more than a couple of minutes.TV shows, not a lot of luck here (finding free up to date content)I hear Hulu-plus is decent, but even if you pay, it has embedded ads?!?  Pointless, another of the reasons I optedto try this technology was to get rid of the obnoxious ads, particularly those that kick up the sound volume on theTV.Luckily I do like old movies, old tv series and Netflix (for me) does a decent enough job of that.Also, if you're thinking this is going to be some sort of magical, automatic, media toaster where you don't have tohit forums, review sites off your pc and generally turn it into a second job to make effective use of it....  Ihave a couple of bridges I can sell you on the cheap.Bottom line, for what it does 4 out of 5;  Implied promises 1 out of 5 Average rating 2, since implied functionalityis what I was after in the first place."
1334,"This DVD recorder barely works passably, but is clearly on the low scale of DVD recorders.But the REAL problem I have is with Toshiba, which has the worst support service I've ever experienced.  It's all automated, and worthless.  And tho you THINK you'll ultimately get a real person on the line -- because you are being told to &#34;Wait, someone will be with you shortly&#34; -- after about five minutes you're told to call back later.  Every time.  They must laugh at the idiots (like me) who purchase their product believing they can get ANY assistance, if needed.I will NEVER buy another Toshiba  product.  I've learned my lesson.  And I hope this word to the wise will discourage others from ever looking at Toshiba products as potential purchases.  Don't do it: If anything ever goes wrong, there will be absolutely no help from Toshiba -- because they are the WORST."
1335,"Although they work, they don't really fit my ears the best and they don't have the best sound. I bought them as in-ear monitors for vocals when I'm playing (I'm a drummer) but they don't seem to cover the lower tones very well. They have a &#34;dry&#34; sound to them, almost like they don't have any bass. The headphones that come with Ipods are better than these, and I don't care for them much either. Unless you're using them for a phone or something, I wouldn't buy them."
1336,"I purchased this camera at a local retailer. I was mainly attracted by its HD video feature. I wanted to use it in addition to my camcorder to record myself playing the piano, indoors of course.Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed by the video quality. On my first video, the whole picture was yellow, clearly a white balance problem.On my second video, with the DMC-FH20 set on a tripod, everything was blinking, including the piano lid, which should have been a solid black. Even though there are 1280x720 pixels at 30fps, the quality is barely better than what you get from a typical camera phone. And it is inferior to my Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 webcam.Also, another thing to know is that you can't change the zoom while recording video. You have to stop the recording, change the zoom setting, and then start recording again. This didn't bother me for the piano recording since I was recording myself, but you should know about this limitation - this camera is no camcorder.One more limitation in video is that the camera records in Quicktime (motion JPEG) format, but not AVC HD. This causes files to be large. I'm not sure if the Quicktime CODEC contributes to the poor video quality also, but it might.When it comes to still picture quality, they come out very noisy indoors without the flash. With the flash on, they are actually OK. But I'm not sure that having 14 megapixels on such a small sensor really adds much. 8-10 would probably be just fine and might have less noise.I returned the camera mainly because I couldn't stand the video quality. As a still camera I might have kept it, but I wouldn't have paid as much for it, and I was hoping to minimize the number of photo/video devices I own.Pros :- 8x optical zoom which is better than most compact cameras- pocketable size- Future-proof SDXC card slot- OK pictures with the flashCons :- Poor low-light performance without flash- Poor video quality, not HD quality by any stretch of the imagination- Zoom can't be changed during video recording- Proprietary lithium-ion battery- No optical or electronic viewfinder, only LCD screen"
1337,"This product represents a conundrum:  what do you do when camcorders have become so small you no longer need a case?Case Logic invariably produces well-made, durable products with useful nooks and crannies.Would I use this for my Flip HD?  No---there's no need.It's too small for my Canon camcorder.I cannot imagine who might need this product, which makes me think that Case Logic and other accessory manufacturers would spend their time more wisely building out useful tools kept in simple pouches (such as that which houses the Flip) rather than shrinking down cases from the days when camcorders were larger.It's time to change.Nobody's going to lug around a pile of individual cases for devices which fit easily in a pocket."
1338,"The product works but has a lot of issues.- it's not very stable. It falls at sharp turns.- volume was way too small even at loudest;- remote doesn't work, volume up sometimes works as volume downThe only pro is it has an USB jack which can b used to power another deviceOverall, worth the money but most ppl should stay away"
1339,"I'm an extremely knowledgeable developer/network guru.  This device fought me.  Do not buy this if you know what you're doing, or are going to configure it a bit before taking it to the final installation destination.  You can't even FATHOM how bad the setup for this router is.  I mean, go ahead and try to make it as stupid as possible.  Done?  Now compare it to this:1. Initially, you can only set it up by the CD. No browser connection allowed.  (Actually, you can... see below.)2. So you optimistically plug it into your switch and boot the CD.3. Error!  Too many networks found.  Can't configure the router.  So plug it into the desktop computer directly.4. What?  You plugged it into a second port on your P.C. so you could stay internet/network connected?  Nope, router still says too many networks.  You can only have the router connected.5. Okay, with ONLY the router connected, Cisco Connect found the router. But it's not connected to the internet.  Aborting!  Huh?!Seriously, this is one screwed up setup.  And if you then go to ""advanced"" setup (which you can't do before failing all the rest), it warns you that this could prevent you from using Cisco Connect in the future.  Oh, we can only hope!Oh, and did I mention there's no printed manual!Once you get this puppy configured halfway, as long as you wrote down (and promptly changed in TWO places) the cryptic passcode it creates for you, it seems to be a fine piece of kit.  But getting that far... if you know how to do it normally... is frustrating.  Instead, you should either use Cisco Connect with just the router connected to your Windows/Mac box, or read page 16 in the PDF inside a subdirectory of the CD and use 192.168.1.1/admin/admin to get into the configuration.  That's easier and faster.I'll update this review with performance, etc, later if it warrants it."
1340,"Good sound in these headphones. I wish they would last. I had a pair that lasted almost 6 months until the actual speaker part separated from it's housing. After using super glue for a month it finally developed a short. I am hard on headphones so I assumed it was something I had done. So I bought another pair because i love the sound for the price. They lasted 2 weeks until they had the same problem as my previous pair. Skullcandy was good about offering me credit if I shipped them the broken ones, but I don't really want another pair that will break again.If you plan on siting in a chair and not moving form that spot while the headphones are in and basically just sitting still, these headphones are great, If you plan on walking around with these. Maybe you should try something else."
1341,"Gave to my brother as a gift and they broke after a month. The neckbands starts peeling after  about a week or so. Keep in mind he  used them before bed and around the house, and that feature is probably for joggers so the sweat will probably finish them off faster. Then after a month one speaker went off and the thing snapped. They might be good for you if your just  going to use them while you sit at your computer or something like that. The sound was good but the quality of the product wasn't."
1342,"This is my second (and last) Magellan GPS product.  I really DO like it.  My ONLY complaint is that I bought 'lifetime maps'.  For those of you expecting maps as long as the unit works, beware!1. 'lifetime' is defined by Magellan as a product lifetime of '3 years'.  If you buy it near the end of its lifetime, that's your problem.-- updated 11/15/2012;  Now on their website, they say 'lifetime is as long as maps are available for that device, but you have to pay $99.99 to add the 'lifetime maps' service.  Considering that one map update is almost that, it's a bargain, BUT, that still doesn't help when I thought I BOUGHT 'lifetime maps' already.2.  I'm trying to get a map update now.  I've owned it for a year (bought it new here at Company A).  I'm told I have to BUY the maps.  Trying to find a phone number or email link or ANY way to contact 'customer support' is almost impossible.  I finally found a way to register a complaint, but if they don't reply, I have NO way to contact them.Don't get me wrong: the GPS unit works fine.  I've used it to travel thousands of miles.  This is the largest and easiest screen I've ever owned. But it's the map upgrades that I'll look at FAR more closely when I buy another one.  I assumed 'lifetime maps' simply meant I didn't have to worry about getting maps in the future.  (*sigh*).--- updated 11/15/2012FYI: I bought this LESS than a year ago -- it was shipped to me from Company A in 1/9/2012.  I finally found an email link and sent in an email request for a free map update.  The map update is $89.99, but i deliberately bought this model so I wouldn't have to buy map updates.--- updated 4/10/2013NEVER got a response from Magellan.  My husband and I both had magellan units (I've bought 3), but when we had to replace one last month, I bought a Garmin.  No more Magellan, I'm sorry to say. The lack of any customer support has lost them a repeating customer."
1343,"Tested the monitor's DVI port with several cables and always got ""NO SIGNAL"" error in the screen... also tried with all the same cables to another computer that works with a Midnight 24"" monitor on DVI port and the result was the same...Reading on several forums I found this might be an issue with the power source and voltage required by this monitor... will let you know soon.So far I am using my computer's DVI port with an adapter connected to a VGA cable... as VGA port on monitor gives no errors. Disappointed."
1344,Found these to be hard to work with.  They would not focus smoothly and the field of vision was very small.
1345,The screen protector was a waste of energy.  The rubber case won't be used but worth the $5.
1346,"First let me say, I loved this unit when it first went into action.  I got this for my wife for Christmas and when we first set up in her kitchen, it worked great.  The sound was more than enough to fill the room and it worked with her iPhone 4S perfectly.  The buttons on the top were pretty cool, as it only takes a slight touch to activate most of them.  The radio reception for adequate, given that we live in an area that generally has poor radio signal.But then, about 4 days after using it, the iPhone dock stopped working.  There is no connection when the phone is set into the cradle.  It neither charges, nor plays the phone through the unit.  I don't know if there is a short or something, but I do know it does not work.I'm rather disappointed in this.  I would have loved to give this thing a much better review, but now, I think I will be looking for a replacement.  I will have to investigate the return policy with this through Company A.Stay away from this discontinued Sony unit.  I read some bad reviews and thought the people were just negative by nature because Sony normally produces top quality electronics.  If you want to use it for simply a stereo, which by the way is battery operated, go for it.  If you expect it to be a dock, look somewhere else."
1347,"I have a lot of rokkor lens' so I was excited the I would be able to use them with my Canon 60d & t2i, but alas I only get an error message when I take a photo. I read a review that said some of them were faulty so I returned it and ordered another. We will see how that one works out."
1348,"Hi folks. I've given this product two stars because it is very much a let-down from the factory stereo in my '02 Mustang (base model. I was having problems with getting disks to switch and eject in the factory 6 CD changer and thought why not go to a USB car stereo where I can load up a huge assortment of music on a flash drive and play tunes on shuffle. I looked at the reviews here and there was praise of the sound. So, I pulled the trigger on this model because I don't need blue tooth, DVD, navigation, marine, satellite radio. I wanted it for one function really, the USB capability. I have had other JVC products over the years and thought, this might be as good. Well, the sound has that cheap car stereo sound of yesteryear where there is no presence and a sound of distance as if your listening to a stereo outside of a room and there are obstructions in the way. It's capable in most other regards and doesn't look particularly bad but I'm stuck with a disappointment now and I'm pretty shocked. I had the Mach 400 and not the Mach 1000 stereo factory installed in the car, so one would expect at least an even performance switch sound wise. Not so. I don't know where to steer you if sound is the most important feature to you accept for away from this JVC product. Bummed."
1349,"The battery was the same as the standard battery that arrived with the computer, however I can get two hours at best with a full charge. Not worth it to return it for refund."
1350,"The backdrops wrinkle very easily. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting wrinkle-free backdrops, otherwise your shots are going to look icky."
1351,Had to return this item. Couldn't get the computer and boards to except each other. Took the computer into the shop.They put in new boards.
1352,"Pros:  I like the size and styleThey come in black or white (I hate white electronics so this eliminated some competition)Cons: The sound quality isn't as good as my last wireless speakers from Acoustic ResearchFor the price, my expectations were higher for sound quality and interference toleranceYou cannot buy just the transmitter from Grace (I had just a pair of speakers at first and I contacted them and they told me I would have to buy this set which I did (So I ended up with 4 speakers)Within a few weeks it sounds like 2 of the 4 speakers are blown.  They are distorted, muffled and sound bad.  The other two still sound OK.These still use analog signals just like the ones I bought 10 years ago from another brand, and these are prone to static and interference like those were.Other thoughts:  I really hoped with these being a ""new"" design from a newer player on the market that these would bring something new to the game.  The transmitter for these work with my 10 year old wireless speakers from another company.It looks like I'll be trying to replace the built-in 2 1/2 inch speakers myself with something of a better quality.UPDATE: I have spent many hours fidgeting with these speakers.  I have replaced the speakers with after market ones and then gone back to the stock ones.  The end result:  the enclosure is designed specifically around the speaker they use and finding an exact replacement was impossible for me.  What I found was compatible and worked, but the way the enclosure is designed will only sound good with identical replacements.  In the end I have 2 speakers that sound like carp, and 2 speakers that sound OK.  I trashed the 2 defective speakers and considered them a waste of money.  Unfortunately, I will not purchase again from this company."
1353,"Purchased this product for Netflix and iso video files. So far streaming Netflix from this device has been a problem. Other devices don't have issue, but this device freezes a lot. Not sure if my product is defective or if this is consistent with other people."
1354,"This is not really a Harmony remote because it completely lacks Activities, the signature feature of Harmony remotes. It appears to have a single activity button (Watch TV), but even this is not a real activity in the traditional Harmony sense - all it does is turn on the TV and then switch to Device mode for your default video input device. You cannot customize this pseudo-activity. This remote would not be of interest to someone actually looking for a real Harmony remote. It would only be of use for someone looking for a replacement remote which can take advantage of Logitech's large online database of devices. It's certainly not worth the price though."
1355,"This TV is about 2 years old and out of warranty. The TV is good, picture is good, but a two year old TV should not have component failure like this.The IR sensor on the TV went out. The remote that came with the TV wont work (but still works on the other components), and confirmed by another universal remote that works on everything else but the TV Looking on the net, this is a common problem with these TV's.The repair guy knew all about the problem. The part is inexpensive &lt;$10.00, but they will ship a main board also just in case, so $251 with labor to install, and if the main board is ok (which they say is typically the case), the total will be $152.00.Without this issue, this TV would be a 4 star (4.5 if there was a choice).Perhaps they fixed this in the newer models, I would hope so. So if you are OK with some inconvenience, and additional costs, it is a good TV, but I expected no issues so soon, so two stars from me. I suggest considering getting the extended warranty (which I rarely do, and would never suggest until now)."
1356,"This item does its job when it comes to extension and horizontal rotation, but on the vertical swivel, it fails miserably. The construction is sturdy, but the connector to the monitor relies on two plastic fused to metal screw to control the torque. Which means, when the screw goes bye bye, your monitor no longer stays up instead it faces down. Not recommended!!"
1357,For some reason this device doesn't produce stero sound through a radio. I had another transmitter that worked much better. I liked this one only because of the cradle which my other transmitter didn't have.
1358,"If you wiggle the cord, the sound will go in and out, playing havoc with phonecalls. I foresee having to replace this soon."
1359,Very cheaply made.  One leg popped off when removeing one of those tags with the thin plastic.If it wasn't such a pain would return it.
1360,"I bought this for a friend for christmas so we can stay in touch.So my review is really for how the other-end is experiencing this camera.I'm not sure if it's a setting either of us can't figure out, but the image keeps switching from standard to widescreen to standard. AND it often blacks out for a second then comes back to normal.I would complain, but my friend has no idea what i'm experiencing visually.I'm positive it's not my built-in isight that's causing the problem."
1361,"The battery is OK for a replacement. It certainly doesn't stay charged as long as the original Midnight, but it worked.Had it for some time now and it won't even hold a charge at this point. Have to leave the Laptop plugged in to use it."
1362,"Worked great for a year, perhaps a year and a half.  At that point it kept turning on to the dock function.  I would turn it off and it would turn itself right back on.  If I wanted to listen to the radio or line in functions, it would flip back to the dock, so I had to replace it.  A hundred dollars is far too much for something that will only last a little over a year.  While it was working I really liked it.  I replaced it with this sony.  It doesn't have as good sound as the philips does, but I hope it lasts longer.http://www.Company A.com/gp/product/B005GUAIBU/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1"
1363,The ear hook clip replacements did not fit my device.  They are very sturdy but could not make it to fit any of my devices.
1364,"Although the cap seems to be well made, I found it impossible to attach the included tether to it. if you are an old gut with arthritic hands, check around for a product the is a little more user-friendly."
1365,"The user interface is a cumbersome disgrace of a a UI.  It's not buggy, just poorly designed.  The last firmware update nuked support for my wireless dongle that was working just fine. I had to roll back to a previous version of the firmware to get wireless working again.  The EDID reading (HDMI hadshake) is buggy with my Phillips TV.  It's a known issue with several TV manufactures that WD doesn't seem to want to address.  HDMI works great for all video except netflix....  netflix (to avoid technical discussion) simply 'uses more copy protection'  which uncovers this flaw in this WD device.  I had to run this box via component cables instead of HDMI to get netflix to work.I'm keeping it and moving it to the bedroom while replacing living room media center with something better; however, I would not purchase this again if given the chance mostly due to the UI layout and the lack of meaningful updates from Western Digital.But with all the negatives, I just add that the feature set is good.  This box simply does play every single type of file I've thrown at it."
1366,"I've owned this since October and use it every few days to charge my iPad.  Now I see what the over reviewers have said.  Although my unit is still functioning, one of the outlet plugs has broken and it doesn't always properly connect.  I expect it will only last a few more days at this point..."
1367,"This is a good computer in it's class, good value for money and I have no complaints with it.BUT when I registered the product I created an Acer Web account. Today I wanted to get some clarification on upgrades - and guess what I CAN'T login - Acer has decided (apropos of what I know not) to disable the account (it has ""expired""). So I got on the line with Acer to re-up my account. There response is YOU HAVE TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT. I sugested they delete the account and I'll recreate it - they insist that my ONLY option is to create a new email account then a new Acer account. What a load of cobblers - they expect me to create a new email account (increasing my exposure to all kinds of nasties, including ID theft because THEY SCREWED UP). This kind of ""technical"" support I do NOT need! If this is the best they can do I'll be looking elsewhere for future purchases."
1368,"After reading many good reviews, I brought my Magellan SE4 in 2011. It was easy to setup and use, has great speech turn by turn directions with many other impressive features. I was very happy with it until I discovered I would have to pay another $79 to update the maps. In the past few years, there's been a lot of new construction in my area, so I can't totally rely on it's accuracy. It makes good sense to me to apply the money I would spend on updates on another GPS with free lifetime maps."
1369,Like others I didn't know the unit needed to be wired to power.  The instructions make no mention of that detail.  Very amateurish instructions.  I finally found one line on their Website instructions that mentioned the wiring and but it did not say to wire to the yellow always live wire.  Once installed the presets only show on screen every other time the unit is turned on.  When the presets are missing the channel can't be changed either though the unit does correctly remember the station that was on last time.  Overall the unit has been a headache.
1370,"I'm aware that not everyone has the same problem, but mine would black out occasionally - the second screen would just go black for a few seconds and turn back on.  It's quite annoying."
1371,"I'm not going to cover what's already been said, but I have a few things to add.The input selectors on the remote and front panel of the receiver are a stroke of genius!  It makes it possible for even my mother (no disrespect intended, but she just doesn't get technical things!) to operate the thing.  It also discourages users from inadvertently changing settings as she constantly used to do while trying to switch inputs.  In this regard, the receiver is definitely superior to the Denon AVR-3311ci (but unfortunately without MultEqXT).The fact that the remote has them too is also awesome, and that it switches remote function mode is also awesome.  It also controls many more things than most cheesy universal pre-programmed remotes.  Kudos for the guys who had the idea of internet lookup for programming remote codes and then programming the remote from the reciever!  That's the ""coolest"" feature on this thing, even if it's not completely necessary.I sure would have liked an RF (non-infrared) remote though, especially as a second remote for zone 2 and 3.  Let's face it, an IR remote for zone 2 and 3 is worthless since you're going to be running those zones outside the room.As far as the on screen display (OSD) and overall user interface, these people should all get Apples and iPods and play with them for a while to see what a real GUI (graphical user interface) should be.  I'm not an Apple guy, but they sure know how to make a good user interface.  The folks at Onkyo have a long way to go.  Sadly I've heard this receiver is one of the better ones in this regard, so this isn't a slam on this receiver in particular, but on receivers in general.For anyone at Onkyo who may be paying attention, and to users everywhere, this is my pro/con list for the user interface:Pro-Easily readable, and fairly well organized once you get the hang of it.Lots of options!Fairly good looking.Cons-Remote buttons are unclear as to what they do, and receiver is sometimes slow to respond.Many buttons won't work at a particular time, with no explanation on the OSD.Many options are often greyed out, with no explanation unless you read the manual.  Good grief people, a simple ""this option is not avaiable because..."" would be great.Most relevant information is only available on the OSD, rather than the receiver front display.  Why do I have to have my big screen running to listen to internet radio?!  Show the station name and song title on the front display like every other internet radio!I'd like even more options (like volume change speed).The amp is powerful and clean, which is a big step up from my old Kenwood.  I'm not sure how it would do with all channels driven, but most likely this is a limited use case scenario.The front fold down panel is hefty and looks like it won't break easily.  The receiver has a great look to it and really adds class to my system.The internet radio is great, however I have some complaints:-As I said above, show the song title and station name on the display!  I don't want to have my expensive TV running just to show song title!-Make it easier to change the station, just like regular stations.-Quicker start up would be nice.  It takes probably a full minute to start up the internet radio from power off.I would also like to add that the OSD is usually pretty important to see, so in general (not just internet radio) you often need to run the TV even for audio sources.  To make matters worse, there's no provision for analog out while HDMI is selected, so you can't run a little display for audio and the HDMI output for video.  You can switch, but it's a menu operated choice that's not easy for novices to switch.For this kind of money I almost expect a color LCD front display.  I know no other receiver company does it for this price, but it wouldn't add that much to the cost, and it sure would enhance what kind of info you can put there.  I'm not into bling, but it would be much more flexible than the old vacuum florescent display they use, and would hopefully solve some of these problems mentioned above.I had high hopes for this receiver, and it's fulfilled most of them, but it is a little rough around the edges, as I assume many of these AV receivers are.  Let's face it, receiver manufacturers are charting new ground here, and they don't appear to be doing their homework in the GUI category, but again, this is a great receiver that does what it says it will do.I chose this receiver over the Denon AVR-3311ci because of several things:- 9 channels in the amp, this is cool and handy- Crutchfield guys said this one is easier to use- More zone options- More pre-outsUPDATE: After it was a few months out of warrantee, it stopped having sound with HDMI input video sources.  Thankfully, Onkyo agreed to repair it free of charge, but looking on the web, this seems to be a _very_ common problem on this line of receivers.  I expected more from Onkyo, but have to applaud them for owning up to it by repairing my unit free of charge.  After I received it back, it worked great, but then soon started not playing sound for HDMI video sources unless you select another input and then select the original input again.Say I turn it on to play a DVD.  It shows the video, but no sound.  I have to select ""Game"" input (or any other) and then select DVD again, then it will play sound.  I told this to Onkyo and they agreed to fix it again in the future if it fails completely again.  I definitely give them Kudos for the customer support, but this doesn't completely make up for a receiver that I have little confidence in.Bottom line: AVOID THIS LINE OF RECEIVERS!"
1372,It can work well etc not connect all the person of this company are very amnables and has very customer serivce
1373,"$20 Skullcandy Ink'd 2 were far superior, Yes I had them seated in the ear canal, nice case, returning ASAP"
1374,"After installing this, my laptop slowed to a near-crawl.  I planned to use it to manually back up my documents once a week or so, but the ""always on"" nature of the software just used too much memory for me to keep the drive installed.  Even with the drive turned off, it would ""backup,"" really just slowing me down.  I've un-installed the software, and will probably just do manual back-ups when I can."
1375,Item looks nice but will not work with my Midnight 860.  The computer just keeps telling me the driver will not install correctly. Have found no fix for it thus far.
1376,I purchased two of these for my two kids.  Both have iPhone4's I have an iPhone 4 too.  The Philips app that needs to be installed to make the speakers work has major problems.  The phone won't recognize the speaker when docked and Philips support has only one solution: Hold both buttons down until the phone reboots.  I've done that with all the phone and then they will work for a short while then stop working again. This has happened with three different phones using two of these speakers so it is no fluke.Philips if you are reading this you need to fix it quick and you can post a reply comment or they will be returned to Company A for a refund FAST!!
1377,"I very rarely return items to Company A, but this was one of those items. It is hard to buy speakers or sensory items on the internet- there is something about touching, seeing, hearing etc that needs to be done. With this product, I would recommend heading over to Best Buy/Target/Wal-mart and listening to this in person. I found the low volume sound to be pretty decent, but as soon as the volume was increased, the quality of the tone was lost. I wanted something with much better quality, so I ended up spending about twice this amount on a larger product (Bose). I would not recommend this product for whole room sound or sound outside the size of a cubicle."
1378,"Just  ok headphones. Not the best. Poor sound quality, comparing to my other denon that cost me $100. Have them as spear ones."
1379,"These cords are very cheaply built and simply do not last long.  The adhesive is very weak and regularly come off.  Also, delivery time was extremely long."
1380,"First of all: this is cheap. A nice, cheap option.The laser pointer is nowhere to be found, it has a low power white led light instead.Ok for HTPC uses, but NOT for presentations.The touchpad is not that good. parts of it are not that sensitive, so I ended up using only 1/3 of it.Missing 'stop' media key. It does has pause/play, fwd, etc.Not sure how long it will last. Remember this is a cheap option, so battery cannot be replaced.I'll update this when the unit dies, hopefully wont be soon xD"
1381,"When I first saw the mouse, I was quite intrigued by it and had to order one to see how great it is. Well, it disappointed me greatly! It is cool looking and might even impress your friends but that's about it. From the usability standpoint, it scores very low. You have to hold onto it firmly. Unless you do so, you can't quite hit the desired mouse button. I constantly finding myself hitting the scroll-bar instead of the left button. Also, it is quite uncomfortable to use as there are no room to rest your thumb and ring finger.It keeps the USB dongle on the back of the mouse with a fairly strong magnet but I fear that it will fall off one of these days. Fortunately, the dongle is small enough to keep it plugged into your laptop.While it's an interesting engineering work, I wouldn't recommend it for daily use. Go with Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 instead."
1382,I returned this case. It was much lighter and cheaper than I was expecting. I was expecting something like a miniature laptop case. This isn't even that substantial.
1383,"The date starts off great, it feels effortless and the lighting is very nice. However as time passes, you realize the keyboard is hardly maintainable. It's one of these replace not repair products but the darn thing is so expensive that it doesn't make logical sense. My gripes, the keys get dirty easily, that is things get stuck under them and its impossible to clean and if you try to lift the keys up you will more than likely break a key. Then you are not a happy camper. There's also the finish which wears away in 6 months it seems like. You end up with a keyboard that looks terrible with the high traffic keys buffed down to a polish while the other keys have a matte finish. I've also found that it flexes a lot and after a while it gets warped. I'm on a 2nd replacement from Logitech, first one had an issue where the alt key died. The replacement has worn down, I'm starting to lose the space key and alt key again. And the finish is worn away again.I think I will get a proper keyboard next go around, maybe a K95. In the first six months, I'm in love. Six months later, I want a divorce. That's this keyboard in a nutshell for me."
1384,"I have never owned a wireless keyboard--much less one that has backlight illumination--and was excited to receive this.  Initially, it worked well but the keyboard feel was less exact that my old Logitech K120, and I made more errors.  Additionally, the lighted keyboard automatically shut off after about two seconds of not typing--an annoyance presumably intended to prolong battery life.  Then, the illumination became sporadic and would not work for several minutes only to suddenly and inexplicably resume.  Finally, it gave up the ghost entirely and nothing I could do would coax the backlight to restart.  Recharging the battery made no difference.  Adding insult to injury, my effort to exchange this for an identical model was an exercise in frustration.  The Company A return site simply would not allow me to get to the ""print label"" screen after multiple tries.  A live chat resulted in the individual claiming to send me an email for the labels but multiple refreshes of my browser failed to discover it.  Finally, I simply requested a refund on the site and that went through.  A half-hour later the labels appeared in my email but by then I had repackaged the item for return.  In retrospect, I am glad I did not exchange it and will search for a more reliable keyboard."
1385,"Took almost my entire day trying to figure out how to get it working, as it was not plug in and go as stated. I had to update some hidden Motionjoy driver that the devices installed on their own. I was looking for a nice, easy to use wireless keyboard and mouse that's almost silent, but this keyboard is quite loud and bulky. The wheel on the mouse feels dry and non-smooth."
1386,"""Don't fit with my macbook pro 13"", early 2011. The product description wasn't clear about the macbook pro model. The product is very good but didn't fit in my macbook pro early 2011."""
1387,i give it 2 stars instead of 1 because i had two other macally enclosures ( of different models ) in the past and those worked.  also the build quality on this enclosure is not bad.  unfortunately when i connected it to both my mac and my windows pc it didn't mount.  i didn't use the provided usb power cable but guess what - if it cannot run from bus power alone they should have included an AC adapter and they didn't so i just sent it right back.  also installation of the hard drive was the most difficult i have ever experienced in a USB enclosure and i have used several over the years - the you have to use quite a bit of force to make it go in - but on the flip side once in it is mounted very securely.  also i should add that i have both USB and firewire on my computers and neither connection worked.anyway two stars.  maybe i got a lemon but from my experience i cannot recommend it.
1388,"Let me start out by saying this case is awesome. Period. Read the other reviews for why. The two stars are for....Company A. I bought not one but two of these great cases, and BOTH were missing the toolbox of screws. Oh, you know, no big deal, you're only missing 80+ something odd screws so when you go to excitedly install your stuff into this bada$$ case, you get that wonderful feeling of being ripped off. Then you stare at it fondly, raising a silent fist to the deity that off'd you.Or not. Company A, read this and fix this crap. Stop selling products with missing parts marked as ""new""."
1389,Holes do not line up with anything. But may be there is some ssd or computer bay that it works with.
1390,"This charger delivers what it promises - two 2.1 amp USB charging ports, which is great for newer iPhones and iPads .. wish it was more mobility friendly - the two prong power plug doesnt fold down like Apple products do .. I want to carry this everyday but with these prongs sticking out it makes it less bag-friendly. As a charger maybe it is a 4 or 5 star product, but as a portable carry item it was disappointing. Also, the cable they provide was very low quality - it doesnt stay plugged into my iPhone or iPad - it does not have the ability to &#34;lock&#34; into the phone, so it falls out often - which is very frustrating to find you phone unplugged itself when you thought it was charging over night and now you do not have a charged phone."
1391,"The sound quality from this speaker is not very good. For a plug-in speaker, I expected a lot better sound reproduction...this was tinny, thin-sounding, and had no deep bass response at all. There is no volume control or equalizer controls on the speaker...it's only off or on. All controls of the volume and tone have to come from the player or phone you're plugging into the speaker. The audio cord on the speaker is too short to be of much use unless you have a remote to control your MP3 player. If you have to pick up the player, you'll pull the speaker around with it.My family is very spread out across the Eastern half of the country, so we do a lot of long road trips. I bought this speaker so I could play my mp3s on the road instead of trying to find a different radio station every 50 miles. On the third trip, about halfway to Boston, the speaker just died. It was playing one minute, the next...silence. The battery light was still on, the switch was one...just no sound. I tested the speaker with other audio sources...it's dead.Pros:- The rechargeable battery did make it truly portable. The battery lasted quite a while, so it would be very convenient to take to the beach, drive-in movie (if your mp3 player picks up FM signals like mine).- Nicely sized. It doesn't take up a lot of room in your glove compartment or beach basket.- Attractive modern styling.Cons:- Sounds thin and tinny. Not very good sound reproduction.- Ridiculously short audio cord.- No volume or tone controls.- Stopped working after very few hours of use.It's possible, because of the number of good reviews, that I just got a rare dud that quit working. If that's the case, then as long as you know not to expect perfect sound clarity, this is a good speaker to take to the beach or picnic. It does sound better than those super-cheap battery-operated speakers, but it's far from perfect."
1392,"I swear I looked at each and every single lighted keyboard available for sale and read every possible review.  I thought this would be an ok keyboard and it just is not.  The keys stick, and because it is a smaller keyboard than usual, the delete, backspace, shift, end, enter and etc keys are not where you would expect them to be.  I thought I'd get used to it but nope, they're just in bad counterintuitive places.  I'm going to have to buy yet another gd keyboard.  NOT happy."
1393,"I got these at BestBuy on sale, and good for me, as I have returned the KEB40 before leaving the parking lot. (Got Sony MDR-EX38iP instead.) Here are my reasons:- poor sound quality (tiny, lack of bass, lack of clarity)- poor fit, even with different optional earbud sizes- weak cable, and seems it would break easily"
1394,"This product includes lifetime maps for ""U.S. and Canada."" Alaska is part of U.S., right? I landed in Anchorage June 1 and discovered Alaska not included in my Garmin nuvi. I feel ripped off.

Garmin a huge disappointment to me."

1396,"It's fine for stills on the Canon T2i but not for HD video, at least in 30fps 1080p mode.  It records 2-3 seconds and then stops since the card is too slow.  This happens over and over.  So I think that the class 10 rating is very deceptive - in practice it can't even be class 6 (as class 6 is supposed to be adequate for HD video)."
1397,"It plays my music/audiobooks, etc. That's awesome.  It's a pain in the $$$ to use though.  The user interface is bad, and the touchpad is so finicky.  Sansa does not respond to all the feedback they get, albeit some things were updated."
1398,I thought this was such a great deal at first! I worked fine for a while and for only $15! But after a few months of less than average use (as a back up battery) it won't keep my 7D charged for more than 30 seconds.  I guess wasabi is a crapshoot because it seems like some people are getting lucky with their batteries.If it's worth the $15 risk go for it but don't be surprised if it dies on you within a few months!
1399,"As the owner of a 705 I figured the 800 would be a big step up- touch screen, next generation hardware, etc. Wrong, as far as I can tell there' absolutely no new functionality, the battery does not last any longer, the screen is a bit bigger but no better quality in bright light, the bike mount has not improved, etc. The touch screen is nice but difficult to operate on the move- even on smooth roads it is more distracting than I thought it would be to operate the unit- better off with hardware buttons. If you are in the market for a high end GPS cycling unit do yourself a favor and pick up a 705 second hand and use the extra cash to get something else. Garmin was just sitting on their somewhat dubious laurels with this one."
1400,I found the bluetooth aux out to be of low sound quality. The highs were exaggerated and this made all music sound harsh. The in call sound quality generated lots of complaints. It paired ok with my verizon iphone after a few tries. What made me return it was the vent mount. It was very bouncy and not very secure. The windshield mount wouldn't work for me in my honda element as it was too far away. What does work as an audio only solution is my blackberry digital gateway. The sound is much more natural and pairs instantly with the iphone 4.
1401,"I bought this projector because it was cheap and from a name brand.While it worked, the picture was pretty good (for a $170 projector).  Don't expect anything close to an HD signal from this projector.  While it accepts a 1080i/p signal, realize that its output is only 854x480.  But like I said, for what you pay the picture is pretty good.It worked for about an hour before it lost connectivity with the DVD player.  I tried to sync the signal, but the projector wouldn't recognize it.  Tried both HDMI and composite inputs, but no signal was found.  Boxed it back up that night and returned it."
1402,"I was using the Backbeat 903R and decided to try the 903+ for the additional features offered. They sound great and work well for listening to music and I like the audio prompts that are offered. Definitely better button placements too.However, there seem to be an issue when using these with the iPhone4 and it's documented on the Plantronics website. I've actually had two 903+ headsets in the last few days and both have the same issues. First, there's an extreme amount of hissing or static in the left ear with phone calls, which is undoubtedly due to the ""open mic"" feature of the headset. The second set is even worse and I have a terrible high pitched squeal similar to what you hear with some folks and their hearing aids.They have several troubleshooting tips on the Plantronics website including repairing the headset and rebooting the iPhone, but it doesn't seem to have helped much. I will try these for another day or two to see what I can figure out about eliminating the problem but I fear I will need to return them.In the meantime, the 903R headset still works well and I will continue to use it regularly. I don't know if these issues exist with any other phones but it sure is confirmed for the iPhone4. I wish I would have known that before considering buying them. I'd be interested in any future versions that work better."
1403,"I owned the previous version of this headset.  I really like the newer version of the controls.  The sound is also very good and connects well with my ITouch v3.This items started well, but the battery did not last very long.  This headset just failed quickly."
1404,"I was and still am a big fan of the iMaingo2, which I used to use almost daily at work. I got tired of buying batteries, however, and so switched to this product. It worked well for about three weeks, then I began having problems. Because of my high-noise work environment, the iMaingo has to operate at nearly full volume. This caused two difficulties. One is that the batteries wouldn't quite last through a full work shift, which was very annoying. (I'd get about 7 hours.) The second issue is far more serious, however. After two weeks of use the sound quality began to degrade to the point that it can no longer be used at high volume. The speakers sound ""blown"".I also was unhappy with the power-switching system, which I found unnecessarily complex.I own an iPad, and hear iMaingo is coming out with a product for that as well. I certainly hope it's more like the iMaingo2 than the iMaingoX."
1405,"I bought this case to protect the scratch-magnet chrome back.  I had a 3rd Generation Ipod Touch and a case from Belkin that covered the front home button which I liked a lot since the case stayed on the ipod really well. This case, on the other hand, does NOT stay on very well. Whenever I remove the ipod from my pocket, the edges are always off and I have to put it back on.  Also, the strap that runs across the bottom of the ipod just below the home button seems VERY WEAK and I can see this part ripping off or gett stretched out to the point where it'll be better if I cut it off. This was only $5 bucks, give or take a few pennies, so I guess I can't expect much. This is going to be my temporary case until more manufacturers make quality cases for the 4th gen ipod touch."
1406,"After my 10 year old MS trackball Explorer finally died, I was in the market for a new trackball. I love the feel and the responsiveness of the Marble Mouse, but the lack of a scroll wheel sometimes drives me nuts. So I thought I've give this one a try based on all the glowing reviews.Maybe I'm just used to the finger controlled trackballs, but I found it extremely difficult to accurately control this trackball with my thumb. After a week of trying, I was simply too frustrated with it and went back to a finger controlled trackball.Moving the pointer horizontally was fine, as I could do it with one long smooth motion of my thumb, but trying to move the pointer vertically was another matter entirely, I kept having to bend and flick my thumb several times to keep the ball going which meant I simply could not get the same smooth action vertically as I could horizontally. This made accurate highlighting of text or precise selection in Photoshop next to impossible. It also caused my thumb to feel strained after a while."
1407,"I consider myself average when it comes to ordinary projects.  I install most of the things around the house, put toys and furniture together and do a bit of woodworking.  I also install any add-ons I purchase for my computer.  The point being that I should have been able to install this screen protector.  After screwing one up, I am quite sure I would get the second one right, but that was the only one.  for such a cheap piece of plastic film it would have really been nice if Skinomi would have included at least one spare, or something to practice with given the problematic nature of the product's installation.  I will give it 2 stars because I believe if you can get it on correctly it will probably work."
1408,"Although the sound quality of these earphones is pretty decent, the active noise cancellation function doesn't work.  When the active noise cancellation function is turned on the mic on each earphone simply mics the noise into one's ears."
1409,I would save your money rather than trying to get this guy to work in a fashion that will support clear calls with a bluetooth headset. I wish ooma had opted for a good old fashioned headset jack on the telo handset.
1410,"I was impressed with the spec's on this TV when I bought it. But the remote turns out to be rather flake when used. Also, the picture has a very narrow viewing angle. If you are not looking at it from the right up and down and side angle the picture is washed out and uninviting. I wish I had spent more money on an other TV."
1411,"I already have three MP3 players:  a Sansa 8GB, a Sansa 2GB, and an ancient Creative one that's 64MB or something puny like that.  Still, I couldn't resist a free 8GB player through the Vine program.Since I don't have an iPod and never have I can't tell you how it compares to that.  But since I didn't even like this as much as my Sansa ones, then I'm sure an iPod would blow this away.I don't really like the interface or the menus of the Archos.  It was annoying to hunt around the menus for how to set up shuffling and repeating.  Then I had to hunt for another menu to change the auto shutoff from 10 minutes to something longer.  (I'm not sure when I'd ever need a 10 minute auto shutoff.)After I loaded a bunch of files, I clicked on one artist folder and was told that it wasn't in the right format to play.  Now these weren't questionable files I downloaded from Limewire or Bearshare or something like that; these were MP3 files I bought right here from Company A!  Apparently it did play some of the other MP3s from Company A, but that still leaves me wondering just how many of the hundreds I spent time loading it won't play.Unlike my Sansa there isn't an easy way to delete songs once you've put them on.  On the Sansa you can just delete right from the song menu.  The Archos I think I'd have to hook it up to the USB on my computer, open Windows Explorer, and then delete.  (I'll be happy to change this paragraph if someone has a better way.)  That's way too bulky.Even the shuffle feature isn't that good.  I uploaded hundreds of songs by a variety of artists and yet still when it ""shuffled"" it would play some artists in close proximity.  I mean when I've got a few hundred songs a few dozen artists why are you playing two Coldplay songs in a row?  Not very random there.  This happened a number of times too, which I find annoying.I couldn't get the video feature to work.  The manual says you need some converter program but I couldn't find any software for it.  The manual said it was under a ""Software"" folder but I didn't see that folder and I had the ""show hidden files"" on so I don't know what's going on with that.  Not that I see much use for the video feature anyway.  Even if I could upload a whole movie, I'm not going to watch it on a two-inch screen.  That would be lame.In closing, other than added storage and perhaps a slight edge in the sound, the Archos doesn't top my old Sansa 2GB, let alone newer models and definitely not an iPod.That is all."
1412,Seemed to be a product worthy of the cost at first but then when night came it switched to night vision and there was no getting back to regular video.  That causes you to get a white screen during daytime.  Annoying!  Sent it back.
1413,"This case provides adequate protection once it's on, but getting it on is a bit of a challenge because the plastic is so stiff.  I had t press and squeeze my ipod so hard to get it to fit in this case that the screen had some temporary discoloration from being flexed.  Luckily it wasn't permanent, but I don't like subjecting my expensive electronics to that kind of force to get them into something that is supposed to protect them.  Also it fits so tightly that if you have any kind of screen protector film on your ipod it causes bubbles in all the corners.  I got another case that fits looser that was cheaper and I'm much happier with."
1414,"Both this style and the black style for phones, fail. I've owned my SE535's for a couple of years and have gone through 2 of these cables and two of the phone style. That's insane."
1415,"The adaptor works fine and does what it should, but when the plug is pulled out of the computer (even carefully) the cover slides off exposing the connections...really no excuse for that especially since its not the type of thing that you want to leave plugged in all the time (since on most computers plugging into front mic and headphone jacks activates these and turns off other default choices)."
1416,So I bought 2... One works fine and one literally broke the second I opened the legs. The leg literally cracked and snapped off...So ya whatever it's 5 bucks but still it's a waste of my time dealing with return
1417,"Bought this hub because I have a MacBook Pro which only has 2 USB ports and needed to connect external hard drive, matrox dual head to go, keyboard, mouse, iPhone, and anything else that MIGHT require powered USB slot and the power adapter had a piece of metal rattling around in it that I had to remove before I plugged it in and it never powered anything I plugged into it.  When I contacted the company they told me that ""... This is not a powered USB hub as the A/C adapter is to power the LED lights that light up when you plug something in to each port.Unless you need a passive 10 port USB hub, do NOT buy this.The only thing keeping me from rating this one star was that it DOES function as a passive USB hub."
1418,"I am a little disappointed with this case.  The cutout for the front and rear camera partially covers the camera and the video/picture is affected.  I can reposition the iPod so that the camera is clear of obstructions but once I close the case I may have to reposition the iPod prior to using the camera the next time.  This case is of decent quality but not on par with DLO's leather case for the previous generation iPod touch.  Other than the nuisance with the camera cutout, this case will provide maximum protection for your iPod touch.  Note that this case comes in a Ziploc bag.  The screen protectors are a nice addition.  The tip of the pen is foam and works, but is useless to me."
1419,"This product has too many limitations for me.The playlist, touch screen and flexibility were not up to my expectations.I guess you get what you pay for, but they had me fooled.No, I would not recommend this product."
1420,"I was really hoping to like this product!  The provided screen protector has really, really  bad glare.  It (the screen protector part) also looks like it would scratch very easily.  The fit of the case is a bit ""creaky"", and the bottom does not fit snugly, leaving a gap in the two halves.  I'm sending it back.  : ("
1421,"I had an OE pouch just like this out of the box that my blackberry came in.  I lost the pouch on an airplane, so was happy to be able to get the identical one from here on Company A for a good price.  Im using it, but it had issues from new.  Specifically:1) The belt clip was in no way adhered to the pouch, so it slips around in the hold in the ""leather"" that it sticks out of.2) The ""leather"" that is used is a very low quality fake bonded material that immediately starts to show scrapes and ""chips"" out of its outer service.  The one that came with my BB took over a year to start to show any effects of ageing/rubbing/wear, while this one did instantly.Id stay away and look for a high quality variant."
1422,"First, there's no doubt that these little T-Amps are a wonder at the price. The 2020 chip in this (and several other T-Amps, including the far superior -- and two-to-three times as pricey -- Topping TP20) is amazing. (Apparently it was named one of the ""25 microchips that shook the world,"" or some such thing --- at least that's what the always-reputable Wikipedia tell me. Seriously, though, Wikipedia isn't lying. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers gave the chip that designation.)The problem with the LP-2020A+ isn't the sound of the chip (which is great) or the power of the amp (which is decent enough to drive small bookshelf speakers). Rather, the issue is the overall build quality of the Lepai.Turning the unit on or off produces a moderately loud popping noise through the speakers (not good!). Now, from reading online, this can be fixed if you're electronically inclined (I'm not) and want to spend the time/money modifying the Lepai. Plus, holding the Lepai is like holding a knock-off toy truck. It feels...insubstantial. (Of course, if it sounded great without causing the popping noise, I wouldn't care how it felt!)All in all, unless you're looking for an electronics project, spring for a better T-Amp, like the aforementioned Topping TP20MK2."
1423,"I needed a large screen for my presentations. I read the reviews and liked what people where saying about the quality of the unit for the money you paid. I got it today and I'm dissapointed with the build quality. They use really low grade sheet metal for the screen casing and the tripod. And they cheaped out on the parts that do count which include the attachment points (plastic) where the screen attaches to the tripod, including handles, the attachment points for the moving parts like the tripod, etc. I can imagine they also cheaped out on the spring inside that keeps the screen taut and rolls-up the screen. Even the spray paint on the unit is low grade it looks like they used a paint brush to paint it on. If someone is using this as a portable unit for presentations, even if they plan on using it periodically, I can't see how this is going to last. They also ship it in a very long box that is not rigid enough for shipping. When I opened the box, the screen casing was bent, fedex must of dropped it on an object right in the middle of the unit making the casing bend out of shape. I don't think anyone you could make it any cheaper and the company who made it (made in china) should really make it better and charge more if that is what it takes to make a decent product. I would look for something in the $300 to $400 price range for something better if you're looking for a decent product. The Epson Duet 80"" screen is amazing quality and is less than $150. I havent seen any design like it (rolls out horizontally not vertically). Too bad they don't make bigger versions of it."
1424,"This bag is OK. There is a huge problem however, which leads me not to recommend this bag:the strap is not well designed and the attachment opens spontaneously, and the bag drops to the ground, or swings out on one fitting.This can damage the contents.You can fix this by buying a U-shaped screw in fitting. But why should I?Not recommended"
1425,"Cooling fan on this card alone makes more noise than 650W PSU, 2600K stock cooler, and rear 120mm fans COMBINED.If you put your GPU constantly under heavy load, it might be worth it. Otherwise, you are better off with fanless GeForce 8400GS from other manufacturers.Other than that, this card works as expected. No problem whatsoever."
1426,"I knew the case was made for the MacBook Air when I bought it, but the dimensions sounded like it would fit my Company F M11X. It fit inside the case no problem, I started zipping it up and that's when the problem started. The actual metal zipper pull snapped in half, and I wasn't even using unreasonable force to try to zip it. Looking at how snug the zipper would have been had it not broken, it would have never worked with my laptop anyway, which is a shame because it seemed to be able to provide good protection with it's design. But the main zipper just snapping like it's made out of plastic? I guess there's a reason I've never heard of rooCASE. If you have a MacBook Air or another insanely thin 11.6 notebook, this could be a great case for you. But for those of us who have normal thickness 11.6 notebooks, find a better case. I assume mine was just bad luck with the zipper breaking, but wasting 24 bucks on a case that's in the trash is irritating to say the least."
1427,"It transmits audio and low resolution video just fine, but whenever I try to pass higher resolution video it just blacks out.  I switched to a different adapter and it worked fine, so the problem wasn't my source or display."
1428,"I got this adapter to connect my brand-new X230 Tablet to HDMI-enabled devices. Alas, it did not work. Cable Matters customer service was very helpful and after some email exchange I received a second tested adapter which did not work either. The customer service concluded that the adapters were not compatible with my laptop. I returned them and got a refund. After that I bought an adapter from a different company which has been working perfectly ever since.The verdict: two stars for excellent customer service. Yet two stars only because the adapter actually *was not* compatible to my laptop and absolutely nothing in the sales info indicated that the adapter was not compatible with certain PC configurations."
1429,"Pros: Cable seems high quality for the most part.Cons: didn't get any signal at all, tried different monitors and nothing.the lock-in tabs on the DP side are terrible. 3-4 times of pulling the plug out and the end started breaking off the cable itself.sent it back and Company A fully refunded me. what would I do without Company A? :D"
1430,"Perhaps it was my luck, the one I received was great until I plugged into my device and pulled out ... the plastic of the connector came off leaving the connector still plugged in. So no good. Nonetheless, I have confident with Samsung products. Like I said, it may be my luck."
1431,You still have to hold this up in your laptop or It will overheat on top of the bed spread.It doesn't cool as advertised but I am stuck with this so I will just have to use it on my lap onlyor elevate it manually on the bed if necessary
1432,Look noughting like the picture. Makes your wrist sweat a lot. Doesn't feel good on wrist. Color is a bit ugly. Makes Ipod look ugly. Not worth the money. Get something else.
1433,"I just got this one as B-stock from Company A. After burning-in for nearly 20 hours, the sound is not very good.Coming from several Grado SR60/80, Sennheiser MX470/471 and PX100 headphones, I can honestly say this one is quite muddy and way too bassy. I tested this using a Sony A-818 and my laptop equipped with external sound card, resulting the same unpleasant darkish sound. I could not believe MX470/471 and HD238 all come from the new product line of Sennheiser, because they are so sonically different (MX470 being very transparent but lacking some bass while HD238 has too much low end and very little clarity compared to the new MX series).Overall, I would say this model is over-rated. Even with its B-stock price, it could still be over-priced. With its MSRP, I think this got to be the worst new product that I have tried from Sennheiser in the last two years.P.S. Maybe my particular phones are really defective? Since I opened them up, the left earpad won't stay on without holding up with my ear."
1434,"It's hard to review a hub since it doesn't really ""do"" much in the active sense of the word.  It works as it is designed, although I agree with some of the other reviews about the cables jutting in different angles.  That's one feature that I didn't find useful at all, especially since I don't have a lot of space on my desk to begin with.  The retractable cord is nice -- probably the most useful ""feature"" of the hub.  Otherwise, it works as it should, the connections were firm (no jiggly or that feeling like the port was going to fall out).  Would have preferred something a bit more linear though."
1435,"Didn't buy from Company A, wished I had. However, it came to me in an email, I loved it, bought it and then it failed in couple hours of use. I returned for replacement. The new one seemed to work fine. Then I didn't have a use for it for a few months. Got it out, hooked one of my tablets up to the big flat screen TV, just to see if that combination would work. The replacement unit didn't work now either. But, at least I know that the tablet to TV idea works and that this type of keyboard/roller ball mouse works on Android tablet to TV.Pros: Great shape, nice quick step buttons, and it comes with rechargable batteries. They charge from an older style 4 pin Micro USB plug.It has soft rubberized feel and the roller mouse and it's quick buttons are also nice features.Cons: The batteries are poor quality and need to be tossed before installing with good, say, 2500mah rechargable AA batteries.THE BIGGEST CON IS THE QUALITY OF BOTH OF THE UNITS I TESTED. THEY JUST DON'T WORK PAST A FEW HOURS OF USE.SAD REALLY BECAUSE THIS KEYBOARD AS SO MUCH POTENTIAL.I GAVE IT 2 STARS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT POTENTIAL."
1436,"Bluetooth devices should be updated to address changes in the protocols and issues that have been identified. This product advertises that you can do that and more--it also claims you can apply different &#34;apps&#34; to personalize the device. After considerable efforts, I have found no way to update the firmware (on my MAC) or found apps to personalize. The firmware problem is a common one based on my internet research. The &#34;updater&#34; software, which works in combination with a website, identifies that an update exists, but no matter how many times you click for it to download, it does not. I was interested in an app to change the devices &#34;voice,&#34; but it is nowhere to be found.PROS--Can be loud enough to fill a room--Does work out of the box even though the firmware is out of date--Is cute--battery charge lastsCONS--Sound quality is average for this price point--firmware cannot be updated on a MAC (I speak from experience)--cannot be personalized (as stated in the instruction manual)If I were to do it all over again, I would have spent $50 to $75 dollars for a better device--one with better sound quality and the ability to update."
1437,"After 100 disks, I have a 15% failure rate either due to write failures or verify failures. That makes these disks of marginal value despite their cheap price.I'm burning using ImgBurn software. I have numerous (5) writers and these disk only wrote consistently in one of those drives, a fairly recent Sony BD-5300S. An older DVD writer was able to write the disks but then couldn't read the disk it just wrote. Testing the so created disks on another drive did not turn up any problems however. Initializing the disk failed often times at the beginning of the write while attempting to set capacity. This didn't coaster the disk and a retry would often times succeed or the disk would burn okay on another drive. Still, it's another indication that these disks are marginal. The white of these disks seems a little yellowish compared to another set of printable disks I own.I did not burn these disks at the rated speed, all burned at 4x or 6x (the minimum the BD-5300S would allow)."
1438,"This is one of the worst devices that I have ever owned PRIOD.....WARNING 4 POINTS OF CUATUION,#1 Viewsonic WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH THIS, they will give you a ""Special Number"" to call#2 Again viewsonic DOES NOT support this device, a third party company called US Merchants does. I bought it at Office Depot on Monday night and it took me nearly the whole next day after 7 phone calls in a 6 hr period to finally get someone on the phone who could help and the first buch of people said I had to wait for someone else !!!#3 Most of the people on here giving this good review are doing so based on insatlling HACKED ROM's from site like XDA Developers and while I too have done that and it does work better NO ONE should have to go through the time it takes to do that just to get a brand new device to work properly NOT TO MENTION IT VOIDS THE WARRANTY for those who are not tech savy or programmers#4 When you run it with a HACKED ROM the tablet is running wide open in SU or Root mode meaning you are HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO PROBLEMS AND ATTACKS ! And god knows who made that ROM or what Backdoors they put into it, now consider this is running internally on you're network... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !(With that said if you are hacker, or Android fan boy looking for a device to play with then it is great, besides the screen)Anyway back to the horrible technical support, when I finally got someone from US Merchants on the phone who knew what they were talking about, they told me there was nothing they could do as their server was down and it would be back up soon. 2 days later it was up and the after doing the update things got worse. My opinon as the owner of both this and an Ipad is to BUY A REFURBISHED 1st Generation IPAD 16 Gb Wife model direct from Apple for 349.99 with 1 yr warranty. You will get upscale top of the shelf technical support, a better screen, more apps and and have no worries as the device wil just work as advertised period ......I say this as someone who is an IT Pro and has been computing since the early 1980's. In that time, I have owned well over 30 computers, nearly every game console and so many handheld devices you would not believe. Over the years and have used all the Operating Systems From Apple, to Atari, MS DOS, Windows, Unix, Linux and others. I have even owned computers most people including many IT Pros have never even heard of like Mattel Aquarius. I have owned original Palm devices from the Palm III to the Centro, Palm Web OS devices, Pocket PC's, Windows Mobile Phones, Symbion, Apple iOS on a phone and ipod touch, an ipad, an android 2.1 Coby Kyros tablet, Android phones and so on. My house is like a graveyard for used electronics I even have a TRS 80 Model I, which still works. YOU GET THE POINT !THE BOTTOM LINEThis device stock has no market without hacking and rooting the device, the User Interface or UI is sluggish and hangs up, it crashes from time to time and the screen is terrible. The overall experince is no where near the quality of my Palm Pre, Zune HD, Ipod touch, or Ipad, for that matter even the Coby Kyros has more going for it out of the box, when considering price point and hardware. As I said above if you are a hacker or Android Fanboy looking for something running adroid to play with then it is a decent device, yet that is not what a device sold at reailers like Company A and Office Depot should be and this is why I gave it only 2 stars. This device should be sold though tech outlets to professionals for experimental or development purposes as it stands. If sold in that way for 299 it would be a solid 4 star product, but it is not and if it were not for how well it actually works once you hack and install a new ROM, I would have given it one star."
1439,"i would not recommend this mini...  the display is very dim and the processor is very slow...  video's are jerky and sometimes, goes into a pause mode...the trackpad is quirky and not very reliable...  half the time, it's doing anything but scrolling...  right click doesn't always work...  left click sometimes behaves like it's being depressed full time...so...for travel, it's not even equivalent to my smart phone...just bigger screen and a keyboard..."
1440,"First let me say outright, its by no means worth $20+.  Am I going to return it?  No.Its an ok piece, couldn't have costed more than 3 dollars to manufacture.  Its a rubbery material similar to that of live strong wrist bands, you know?  Cheap feeling.Pretty damn uncomfortable.There is just no reason to by this, the utility of it is pointless as well (unrelated to this specific product).If you have 20 bucks to throw around, sure. Otherwise get something useful."
1441,"The included speakers/amplifier must be 1/10th of 1 watt, they can barely be heard in a small bedroom. I just wanted something to play USB AND Vinyl and this WOULD have been a perfect item. I will look for something nicer. It does play records well and is made well enough, but the speakers are POOR."
1442,"lost most control of my fingers, body, have constant spasms & tremors (post-polio) now throat Cancer ,so pleaqe bear with me, it hurts like hell 2 type or move(but i ain't dead yet doggitt!)I purchased mine directly from the apple store. I also purchased the 160 gig Classic 7th gen ipod (from here) had problems using the doc insert and had question about leaving the ipod plugged into the usb port would the remote still work. Well, everyone i called (4-5 people) none knew anything about the universal dock and only one voluenterred to find the info or a tech in the correct department. otherwise i got a short Terse No~ (I know nothing)! I got sick of calling so i called apple 2 send it back. their suck port is getting even worse (if thats possible)the unit its self is lacking #1 you cannot change playlists, and i found he menu buttonnever worked. since i'm kinda phycially disabled i assumed this remote would help me find items well it was actually a hinderance.  i never knew where i was, sine it seemed 2 be some delay or hesitation when using the remote and i had 2 get so close 2 the unit i may as well use the controls on the ipod (and i did) 4 that much money 59 buxs it should  have included at least a set of amplified mini speakers or an amplification built into the dock.Romote looked nice but thats about it (looked nice) sad part is i liked the concept but not how apple uteized it!Now what would make apple think a remote 4 the ipod would be nice if iu could't change playlists and if only the menubutton worked (hint hit - apple fix this stuff and i'd by it in a heartbeat.  And get some at least basic suck port)."
1443,"This case looks like a solid, surprisingly high quality product and an overall great deal.Unfortunately I and many others seem to be getting crappy, generic looking cases that are ready to fall apart at the poorly glued together seams.It will fit a Samsung Galaxy S2 with a gel case but I wouldn't entrust an expensive smartphone to whatever refuse I received that they dare to call a &#34;leather case&#34;.The costs of return shipping are more expensive than this case.To those wondering why I would post a negative review for a product that I know full well isn't what the listing is for: check the other reviews, a good number of people are also receiving cheap crap that looks nothing like what is listed so perspective buyers deserve to know that they will NOT be getting what they paid for."
1444,"We ended up returning this not long after we received it. The GUI was very poor and it kept freezing. If you're intending to stream content, get a good quality blue-ray player for the same price. It won't have a hard drive, but you can plug one in."
1445,"I installed this in my hot tub along with a set of rockford speakers to replace the garbage that came with the tub. It's mounted in a totally dry location with a cover over the front, it's NEVER been wet. I went to use it a few days ago & no sound at all, the receiver won't respond to any commands except input changes from the face or the remote. I tried resetting it many times with no luck. I love the ipod tray & I have the hard wired remote in where a tweeter was factory installed so I guess I'll by another with a warranty this time.Thanks sony, I expected much more out of a marine stereo. I had a non-marine kenwood in my last hot tub for 3-4 years when I sold the house."
1446,"The product works well for the price and covers the top and bottom. However, The bottom piece wouldn't line up no matter how many times I installed and reinstalled. I ended up breaking off one of the tabs in the process. The top piece is a piece of work when trying to take it off. I literally thought I was going to break my laptop in the process. A trick I learned here or in another forum is to stick a credit card underneath and slide. It comes right off with almost zero force. After I took the cover off I never put it back on again. Don't want to go through that experience again EVER."
1447,"great cheap price. but the price speaks for itself. very fuzzy.. not happy with it, but i use it anyway,, picture is ok."
1448,Bought this camera with the high hopes of the GPS but that balloon was popped very quickly.  First time I turned on the camera it took the GPS 20 minutes to find its position.  I changed the settings to continuous tracking so when the camera is off it still would know its position.  This did not work.  After turning the camera on again it took 15 minutes to find its position.  GPS does not good if I have to wait that long.  Returning camera to Company A.
1449,"So, I paid $260 for a camera with no apparent way to control the ISO, no common sense way, no dedicated control for doing so, and WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to do so and no auto-intelligence to control the iso in certain modes, and no intelligent combination of certain modes (like skin mode + something else). Angry.But here is my experience: the skin improvement feature is excellent. The background blur mode is not impressive. Not impressed by the 3D mode either. The movie mode looks like Animal Planet type documentary quality, except for a noticeable fish-eye like effect, but this isn't a camcorder with a large lens, so that's not a surprise. Hopefully there's some software that can remove the fish-eye effect from the vids. The pictures are great quality.During the day outside I didn't try any vivid or natural color settings, just shot as is and the pictures were satisfactory. I noticed when blowing up pics to look at the background though, that the details weren't sharp, but looked soft, BUT even though soft, it still had much detail, more than previous point n' shoot cams I've used, like the Fuji HS20. Or maybe the softness isn't worth mentioning because I don't have enough experience. I'm seriously considering returning this camera though because of that moronic decision to make the ISO something you need to dig into and have an advanced DSLR degree to figure out, in exchange for something obvious and quick, which is what everyone with common sense wants. I might exchange it for theCanon Powershot SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD Deluxe Bundle With 4 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card, Digpro Compact Camera Deluxe Carrying Case, and moreor aPanasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 12.1 MP Rugged/Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)since it's more weather-resistant and designed to withstand this dusty desert  environment I live in. But the TS3 reviews are troubling.Update: About 30 mins after writing this review I figured on my own how to raise the ISO, however, not above 800. At that point a hand with a padlock flashes. Where the rubber finger rest is in the back of the camera is where the white balance, ISO and always on/off mode settings should be, like skin improvement so that they can be combined with other modes. And though that rubber serves to protect the camera in a fall, the rubber would be much better in other areas to give more protection in a fall.I found some Yahoo Answers answer in response to someone asking how to control the ISO, and this idiot, as are most Yahoo Answerers, gave a stupid typical answer to ""go look here in this manual and you'll find out"" rather than doing any actual thinking and studying on his own to KNOW that for a fact. But, so I check and big surprise there's no explanation in the guide which this answerer said, ""Knows all"". Angry.Anyone care to explain in the comments as to how to get it to go above 800? Like are there modes that I may be on that prevent that? What modes are compatible with 1600 and 3200?Update: Within hours of use it got dust UNDER the lens, multiple areas. And I realized this when I started seeing blackish spots in the pictures.Concerning the ""awesome"" wide angle, the ends of the picture are HIGHLY distorted and looks terrible, so what's the point of it? Most definitely a return.DID I ALSO MENTION THAT Company A HAS BANNED ME AS OF THIS WEEK, FOR REACHING AN UNSTATED REFUND CAP LIMIT, DESPITE BEING A CUSTOMER FOR FOUR YEARS AND BUYING ON AVERAGE TEN ITEMS OR MORE FROM THEM EACH MONTH AND THEY BEING THE ONES OR OTHER SELLERS, DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD GET REFUNDS, AND THAT THEY REPEATEDLY DELETE ONLY NEGATIVE REVIEWS I MAKE? THE BBB ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THEM A FRAUDULENT A+ RATING (JUST CHECK OUT THE REAL REVIEWS PEOPLE GIVE THIS COMPANY ON THE NET). They have employees who stalk gays, Christians and global warming skeptics."
1450,"I was considering to buy this model so I went to a retail store to check it out. This was definitely not the SONY I used to know. The fit and finish was so poor that it shocked me. The bezel was made by such a low grade plastic and it was not even straight if you look it from the top of the unit. It had a visible gap between the bezel and the panel in the lower corner. The worst part was the base, which was totally unstable. It is the worst design I have ever seen in any TVs. The picture sharpness was okay but the color was blueish in the dark display. The TV was not in the same class of comparable SHARP and SAMSUNG models. Does anyone know who makes the panel for SONY on this model? I know FOXCONN made a lot of SONY models. It's sad to see that SONY, one of the best names in the industry, has gone down to tier 3 level. Their models are not even close to SAMSUNG or SHARP models in terms of design, built and picture quality. No wonder their sales volume is down. I would rather spend a little more on a SAMSUNG or SHARP model instead."
1451,It's not what I wanted!  There are to sizes of the small end and they didn't tell me. I just I have to write it off as being dumb.
1452,When its working its a great drive.  But these drives have an issue that causes them to go into a sleep mode and never come back.  You have to run through a couple of tricks to get them to show up again.
1453,I purchased this in March to setup with an extra monitor I had that I had hooked up to an Apple TV and I was planning on using in a guest bedroom as an internet TV and home media system.First off buyers should be aware that you need a powered USB port to power this speaker and a headphone jack to transmit sound. The unit is very stylish and overall it looks to be a great idea. Unfortunately the results were very disappointing. When the volume was maxed out it's barely worth listening too. I tried the unit on my MacBook Pro and the internal speakers blew it away. I also hooked it up to a first generation Intel Imac and the internal speakers were louder. The sound quality was perhaps better but the volume was far less and not worth using. I would have returned the unit but AM Express charges a restocking fee and it wasn't worth the time.This thing is now sitting in the pile of misfit electronics waiting for a home. I would not recommend it for any use.
1454,"Although I was extremely careful applying it to my screen, there were too many air bubbles that could not be smoothed out."
1455,"I've only had this keyboard for a short time, but then again first impressions are important...PROs- compact, great looks- BT connection worked right away, no issues at all- battery indicator- unfortunately, that's already about it :(CONs- loud typing, the whole keyboard makes a cheap plasticy rattling noise upon every key stroke, like a toy almost- Whoever at Targus came up with the dumb idea of swapping Backspace and Del key should be FIRED, together with the manager who didn't have this tested - on ALL of my PC keyboards (and also on my original Apple Mac keyboard) the Backspace is the BIG key, not the forward delete key. This is counter intuituitive beyond beyond believe, and driving me nuts. I guess one can get used to everything over time, but this is completely unnecessary and very disappointing- The order of the four keys on the lower left is proof that while the command key suggests that it's a keyboard for both Windows and Mac, the Windows PC lclearly was the afterthought as fn/control should be swapped, and option/command should also be swapped so that Alt-Tab is as comfortable as possible.- Low contrast of printed signs on keys don't make it a winner in low light conditions which is often the case when travelling. I suggest backlit keyboard on demand for next generation.CONCLUSIONI will give this keyboard a chance for a week, if the swapped delete keys are still driving me nuts by then I will re-sell it (unless I've already thrown it out of the window out of frustration). Would definitely not buy it again for that price."
1456,"This router has no support for GSM/UMTS modems, so if you were planning to use it with GSM carrier, forget about it, buy another router."
1457,Thick and clear and adhesive but did not quite fit (too big) and also would not lie flat on screen - so had opaque bubbles on screen.  Gave up on using it.
1458,"Have had this camera for app. 6 months now. It was purchased from eBay brand new and I am NOT a camera specialist.I replaced my bulky Canon SX20 which was bulky with the SX230HS based on countless reviews I read regarding quality, performance and video quality. I didn't expect exactly the same quality..but based on what I read, it should have come close.  Here comes the quick review:Good:- I can deal with the proprietary battery. There a number of knockoff copies that are 1/10 the price. They just don't last as long..- Outdoor pictures have amazing colour depth- Options are relatively straight forward- Optical zoom shots are reasonable- Price; Great price point for the features..if they worked as expected...Bad:- Video is below what I expected. I find both indoor and outdoor somewhat grainy and constant refocusing in light changes- Sound on video is crackly from just the lightest adjustment of hand or wind or anything.- Indoor pictures are hit and miss. I really don't understand how crappy some reasonably lit photos can be. I took a recent photo at my daughters graduation that had plenty of lighting and a clear day outside through big windows. And, the photo was completely blurred. I have tried the quick touch to focus. But, this is again hit and miss.- Related to the above, I found focusing/lock takes WAY TOO LONG. I feel like I have force a shot at times...and it doesn't know what to do- A little thicker and heavier than I anticipated- Sports mode or lack of (speed shots) do not exist. Don't buy this camera for sporting events..All in all, disappointed. Canon name has taken a hit on this one in my books."
1459,we ordered this for my sons birthday to go with his new ipod touch. we wanted something similar to an otterbox to protect the ipod. the blue portion of the case is very sturdy but goes on over top of the white rubber sleeve. the white rubber portion bunches up and doesnt easily shape as it should around the ipod. in addition to this the white portion that is supposed to fit into the headphone jack etc doesnt stay in when put in place. it is bunched up and pops back out as soon as you release it.
1460,"Didn't work very well, could have been due to the   dsl ... goes down often so diff to say if a good buy had to send back"
1461,"The idea is to make music available from your mp3 when the radio signal is poor.... unfortunately,  because this unit feeds the music via radio signal (which was not stated in the advertisement webpage), the mp3 music is no better than the radio channels.... ie.... not worth the trouble.  if you just want to be able to connect your mp3 and you waon't be traveling outside an area where there is a strong radio signal, then you might be satisfied."
1462,"I am sad to say after 30 years of being a loyal Sony customer I have found a product that I would not recommend. In the early 80's I bought a Sony Walkman and I was elated at the performance. I have since owned TV's, stereos, Playstations, etc. With this product I am overwhelmingly disappointed. I read the reviews related to lag of audio and despite that I took a chance. What a mistake. The Netflix screen is painfully small and difficult to navigate (Note: I have a 60"" Sharp Aquos so the TV isn't the issue. Netflix on the PS3 is fine). The startup time is exceedingly long (considering previous offerings). One would expect turning on the fast startup might overcome that. However, that produces a black screen everytime I try to turn it on. Finally, switching between my DVR, cable, Netflix, the stereo and a DVD/Blu-ray renders audio unavailable prompting you to turn off the unit to regain the audio (see long start up times) which is painful as well. Please understand I am not being critical for the sake of being negative. When these issues were brought up to Sony they denied culpability and wouldn't do anything to recitify the situation.HOWEVER, when it does work...it works well. The wireless rear speakers produce awesome sound that has caused my family to jump more than once."
1463,"Bought the Blu-ray player to play dvds, the occasional blu-ray disk but mainly for the internet applications and the ability to watch my home movies, photos, and listen to music over the home network.Blu-ray disks play fine; so do dvds.  The menus contain so many internet applications with no way to filter or search.  It's overkill and bogs down the experience.The worst part is DLNA.  DLNA is a fancy term to state streaming your videos, pictures, and songs over the home network to play on your tv.  Well, it sucks big time.  Not all Sony's fault but they are on the standards board and they market the crap out of this feature.If you are streaming your videos/movies over the network, it only plays mpeg-2 videos.  If you have AVI, AVCHD (High Def), WMV, and other mpeg file types, forget it.  Can't even play Sony's own HD videos over the network.  Even if it came from a Sony camcorder.  I've heard some of these file types work when plugging usb directly to the player.  Didn't try it.Ironically, some of my mp4 (High Def) files from my flip video recorder do play.  It's a big tease and over marketed.  That's what Sony has become known for.If you want a basic blu-ray/dvd player with some internet connectivity, this works.  Just set your expectations that you can only view some of your videos and some of your photos over the network."
1464,"UPDATE 6/26/13: they have completely stopped working.Update:  after using these since August I now have a problem where they won't spin at low speed even though you can hear them whining.  Take a star off for longevity...I have these on top of my big audio receiver because there is little room for ventilation and it throws off a lot of heat.  They exhaust out out a tremendous amount of air and keep the component temperature nice and reasonable.  I was surprised at how powerful they are, as they almost vent a 5 foot wide cabinet with stereo components and a very hot running Playstation 3 all by themselves. Almost.Only downside keeping them from 5 stars is that they are a little loud on full speed - it's being a bit picky, but when I have the surround sound on nice and loud, watching a blu ray movie, during the quiet scenes I don't want to hear something that sounds like a computer exhaust fan running.Been using them for a long while now, no issues, work non-stop.  Good quality."
1465,"I did not buy this product on Company A, but thought of letting others know about my experience with this eyepiece set.With due respect to all the 5 star reviewers, I beg to differ on the quality of most of the parts in this set. I used this with my modest 130EQ Celestron reflector. The filters are probably the worst. The blue filter could not bring out any additional details with my kit 20mm/10mm eyepieces or with the set's 15mm eyepiece. The 6 mm seems better, but it is too much for my scope.The 'power doubling lens' is not at all a decent barlow. After attaching it with the 20 mm / 15 mm, the details became worse with it. The only good thing is the t-thread that you get with it, since that would cost you $10 or more outside.Hence though the set may look cheap on the face of it, there are only a couple of things that I could really use."
1466,"If you did your research your here because someone on a forum said this was a good buy. Yes it is, but be ready to buy a hub with a power outlet. The Razpi can not produce enough power to make this function properly. Other than Razpi I lent it out to a friend because her HP laptop's wifi adapter was spotty and needed a more reliable source. Works great on laptops."
1467,"I have two of these, but I just have to say that every time I put the Xoom in the dock I feel like it's going to damage the Xoom.Why Motorola didn't put an index pin or something on the dock to make it easier to align the three separate connectors is beyond me... and why Motorola charges an arm and a leg for the HD dock is beyond me as well (that's really the one you want -- you just can't afford it).I use it, but this may not be something most people find that useful."
1468,"Everyone writing positive reviews must be either paid by Logitech or have their computer about a foot away from the USB receiver module because my keyboard is just 2 feet away and I REGULARLY and CONSISTENTLY get dropped letters and lags and buffering in what I type. Furthermore, the battery is unreliable and it takes LIGHT TO WARM THIS KEYBOARD UP to the point where you can start typing. This keyboard is annoying as hell...not happy. In fact, when I bought a Mac Mini I had the opportunity to purchase the same K750 (white, apple-compatible version) and I spent the extra $10 and got the REAL Apple keyboard and it works flawlessly in a similar setup."
1469,"Tried these out, and only could get about one mile out of them.  I thought maybe it was 16 mile clear sight view.  So, I took them out on the lake on the ice. (kept them warm under the coat till needed to be used.  Still only one mile in clear view.  Very disappointed.  Ad claim should be 1.6 mile  not 16 mile.  Not happy,  may give them to some kid, as they are not what was advertised and do not perform even a tenth of the claim."
1470,"It's nice to have a case for the iPad, but I wanted one that worked with the fancy magnetic cover and this one did not."
1471,"Seemed very flimsy. I never used it-just left the nice, thick faux leather case I have now on my tablet. I donated it to Goodwill when I cleaned out my closets in December."
1472,"I must admit the first time I used the Archos Vision 30c I wanted to throw it at the wall.  It's user interface is so mind-numbingly stupid you will find yourself saying, ""What were they thinking?"" or ""Did they even test this out?"" To begin, the touch controls are unresponsive.  I found myself poking at the display constantly and moving too deep into a menu because I ended touching an area too many times or for too long.  Anyone with normal sized fingers id going to have issues with the volume controls.  You will end up wanting to hire a 4-year-old just to have them press the buttons with their smaller fingers.Ok on to the positives...It's small and it's cheapI tested the music playback.  I used a pair of Seinnheiser HD212 Pro headphones (much larger than earbuds).  During the music playback the sound quality was good, on par with other mp3 players.  Once again the volume slider is very difficult to control.When I switched to the radio I noticed the sound quality decreased significantly.  I was able to get several stations in my area.  This may be due to the fact that I was usuing a large set of headphones (The headphones act as the antenna).  I don't know.  I was able to select the stations using the Next and Prev buttons on the bottom of the display.  If I had to use the station slider, it would have been impossible.I played the video they included, 'Big Bunny'.  The video was difficult to watch because of the reflectiveness of the glass.  Your own face will reflect on the screen, annoying.  The user interface was the biggest issue once again, not responsive. Photos suffered from the same reflection issue. On top of that fingerprints show up on the glass and are hard to wipe away.They have also included a useless calculater and calendar; my cell phone does those better.It is hard to find a situation in which I would reccomend this mp3 player. On paper it sounds like it would be a good player.  I imagine quality was sacrificed to make it so cheap.  I would rather pay more for a device I like, than get a cheap player that I will hate. I think if they had a firmware update and made the user interface better this would be a good player.  So if you can look past this shortcoming you may actually like this device."
1473,Bought this charger in June 2012 for my HP laptop and it worked OK until last week.  It did get hot throughout the year but last week the laptop actually shut down due to a heat warning.  The charger was so hot you couldn't touch it.  I'm just happy we were home and didn't end up with a fire.  I don't think I'm buying the same one again.
1474,"Wow, this thing is a piece of junk - I unfortunately bought 4.  D-Link is a huge company however they've managed to hire the most inept development team known to mankind.  The web interface is limited and the setup of the cameras takes forever.  I downloaded both their iOS and Android software and both are clunky when they actually work.  There is intermittent connection once setup.  The setup is very slow and frustrating.  Plenty of reviews on their apps so go look the App Stores.I instead use iCam (paid software) so I can get multiple devices showing on a single screen.  With this software (I'm not endorsing this software specifically) you use your Mac/PC as a host to pull in all the camera sources via MJPEG (to connect use http://[IPADDRESS]/video.cgi plus the username/password).  Then you connect to your computer using the mobile app and pull all the streams simultaneously.If you don't use a 3rd-party software, the D-Link software requires you to toggle (read: initiate a reconnect) through cameras which takes forever.  I've heard great things about Dropcam but it literally is 4x the cost of what I paid for one of these.  I guess you get what you pay for..."
1475,"Just no. Photos are horrible, camera is not worth the money spent. Would have been better to go with a brand KNOWN for cameras."
1476,Not nearly sturdy enough for anything larger than a dslr. The ad didn't clearly state its weight limitation. I sent it back.
1477,"I had purchased this Sylvania SDVD9000B2 9-Inch Portable DVD Player some time ago and it was pretty much useless to me because it had such a low volume output at maximum settings (yes, I should have read the Player reviews in more detail - others had complained about the same low output).So I purchased a FiiO E6 Headphone Amplifier that works wonderfully well and I can hear the DVDs now !!!!!And I can plug the this player AC adapter into a wall outlet and plug the FiiO into the USB port on the player and run them both off the AC.The FiiO Amplifier does what I wanted it to do, and I can now listen to the DVDs as I wanted, and now I can enjoy the portability, flexibility and ease of use of this DVD player.  It's just a shame one has to spend more money to fix a low volume problem that shouldn't have existed to begin with."
1478,I purchased this item for the new iPad (iPad 3) and the sleep/wake function does not work well.  If I move the cover around after closing it will eventually turn the iPad off but this takes more effort than turning it off manually. I would not buy another one.
1479,It's alright. The case it just over a year old and already falling apart. I expected it to last longer. I don't take it anywhere so it doesn't see travel.
1480,"I first bought this TV in December 2011.  The unit arrived in perfect condition, and I had it up on a stand in minutes.  After turning it on, I noticed a buzzing noise, but figured it was just the TV warming up.  After checking all surfaces and trying out the remote, the shipping guys got my signature and were gone.  Unfortunately, the buzzing remained.  No matter what I tried, it would not go away.  My couch is about 10ft back from the TV, and the buzzing/droning noise was very annoying.  After a couple days, I called Company A and asked for a replacement.  Company A is simply awesome.  Your wish is my command should be their motto.Anyway, the new unit arrived about a week later (Christmas was putting the kibosh on deliveries.  This second unit was similarly in perfect physical condition, but suffered from the same annoying buzzing.  I decided that maybe I could live with it, because the picture is simply phenomenal.  But then I noticed something much more annoying...During the day, I spent a couple hours listening to SACDs on my Oppo.  The Oppo puts up a screen similar to other CD/DVD players, with the corners of the screen holding information like track title, time remaining, etc.  At the center of the screen is s large OPPO in bright white.  You guessed it:  it burned the word OPPO in the screen, and it never came out.  The only time it was noticeable was when the scene turned bright, such as  a sunny sky or snow on a mountain.  You could see the work OPPO in all of its annoying glory right there in the center of the screen.I called Samsung and learned that burn-in was not covered under the warranty, and that I shouldn't watch channels with tickers (like any news channel), or any channel that puts it logo on the screen all the time (like all the other channels).  When I asked how to get rid of the burned in image, they said it was permanent.  When I asked how to avoid burn-in in the future, they said to watch full-screen TV.  I pointed out that almost every television station violates their burn-in rules.  No dice.So I returned the second unit as well, and am still on the search for the perfect TV.  For $2400, you would think there would not be so many issues with these TV's.  I'm going to hold out for OLED."
1481,"light weight but sound quality is not good, no bass at all and also the speakers quality is very low"
1482,"I had purchased some cassette players with a CD player as well at Target awhile back and they were both junk and broke and ruined a bunch of tapes I had. The sound quality is pretty bad on this, but it works."
1483,"This unit has a pretty short range. It is kind of odd since bluetooth is supposed to work quite far. I guess they just have a really cheap transmitter or something. I am not sure. As for the keyboard itself, it works alright. The mouse pad is quite sporadic though. Not very responsive nor does it respond properly. The unit works, but not how I would want to use it. I wouldn't recommend this unit."
1484,"Just as a word of warning, some of these units are obviously defective. Mine had about an inch and half thick gray line on the screen where the pixels had died. I will attach a photo. I didn't use the tablet so I cannot talk about its features. But I actually bought it based on good reviews all over internet. So, in general this tablet seems to perform well for most people and it is quite liked. But it is possible to get a lemon.I had posted a photo of the asus transformer with the line showing in the middle of the screen but it is no longer there. I wonder who took my photo down?? Hmmm"
1485,"When I got the Samsung Galaxy Tab (Wi-Fi) I was so excited, till I found out I could not play my games on it let alone could not get Netflex either that is only for the much better units. I guess you have to pay more if you want more! But I gave it a shot but the screen kepted going dark on me all the time then I was researching for my husbands business and it went dark, I figured it turned off so I turned it on the tab never responded so I plugged it in to the charger and waited then tryed again to turn it on nothing. So I waited 2 hours and tryed again to turn it on nothing. That upset me so I sent it back. I trust Company A and I know they will take care of this. I really like their site!"
1486,"I am sorry, I was very very excited about getting this product and now that I got it, quite a disappointment.1. First of all the sound is very poor. I had a 5.1 Logitech system made for computers and it sounded better.2. Second of all, the conections are not enough. Only 2 component IN, I need more.3. Hard to set up and you need to spend about 3 to 4 hours to connect all your devices and make it work properly. I bought this to make it easier and simpler and it is just as difficult to just connect all your devices to your TV Set.Also if you have this receptor connected with Component to the Proyector or the TV and you connect the Nintendo Wii with RCA Video, you will not be able to see it!!! SO!! I can not hear it in component and I can not see it in RCA, AWESOME!!I understand that Component can not convert to HDMI, but RCA to component??? Most equipment can handle that, the DVR I have can handle that!! And this can not do such a simple action... So absolutely not worth it. I regret this purchase."
1487,This product disappointed me because within a week it broke. I was looking for a long term case but that didn't happen.
1488,"This device works as expected, but the quality of the image is not great, even when the lighting conditions are great. Keep in mind that the video resolution is not HD, but 640x480. I would not buy it again."
1489,"After about a month since installation, it started dropping power connection.I need to open up the laptop, get the motherboard out, and do re-sodering again, which is a big pain."
1490,"if you want to take pictures of yourself,Or you want to be in your pictures within around 10 feet or less and you aim the switch just right at the sensor on the front of your camera your in the right place.If you want to take pictures of others without your arm being part of the picture because you have to keep putting it in the way to get the thing to work; then buy the wired trigger and not this cheap thing."
1491,"I purchased the card to replace a faulty GeForce 256 Mb card.  My main use is for movie's editing through Adobe Premiere Pro CS4.  In general the card is adequate.  But I have found out that a graphic card, in principle, gives no acceleration for encoding in Adobe Premiere Pro CS4. It is not fault of the card.1)Installation on the computer is very easy.2)Driver installation - disc does not open either in my or in my wife's computer.  Fortunately, the computer seeks and finds the driver online.But this driver is version 8, while the company told me that now they have version 11.  With the help of the company's agent I managed to download this version but we both were unable to install it to the card.3)The package comes with no warranty card. On the phone they told me that the warranty is 3 years.4)I was able to reach the Technical support, and the evaluation depends on who is answering you. The first technician almost did not want to listen to me and suggested I return the card to Company A for replacement.  I hang up and called again.  Another technician spent half an hour with me on the phone and mainly resolved my problems.There is another story that I found after several days of use.  I installed Windows 7 at the same time, and there was no sound. I assumed the operating system was at fault, and Microsoft guys of two levels of support spent hours with me and could not resolve the issue, so I almost decided to go back to Vista. Computer saw some HMDI player but not my player. Then I recalled that the card was installed at the same time, took the card out and immediately had sound restored.  I searched the solution via Google and was advised to re-install the card, then to restart the computer, to go to BIOS during start-up and to change audio setting from ""Auto"" to ""Enable"", and the problem was resolved for ever.On March 9, 2012, my monitor gave a message: ""No Input Signal"".  Restarting many times did not help. A friend advised me to take off the card and to connect the monitor to the VGA port of the computer.  The computer immediately started to function as normal.  Therefore, this card with a 3-years warranty died after 5 months.  I am returning it to the manufacturer for replacement but I think that the card from this manufacturer should be avoided.  I reduce my rating to 2 stars."
1492,"Bought this card actually as a high range card (comparatively) for an older desktop.  After installing the card, which barely fit because the ""single slot"" is more like 1.5 Slots and it rubbed the fan shroud I had, I proceeded to get nothing but massive screen tearing and artifacting with the graphics card.  Whenever playing a game, randomly in game it would tear or when going into a 2nd server after being in 1 for a long time the graphics card would be artifacting and staggering until the computer was restarted.  I know the desktop is older but its not way out of spec.  Running the game on the lowest settings still caused it to tear and artifact.  On top of that even running a standard video for 10 minutes in windows media player would cause the screen to tear until restarted.  After doing some research around online (hindsight is 20:20) I found that the 6670 Series from AMD is notorious for screen tearing.  Apparently you either get a good one or a bad one.  So Roll the dice, or spend a couple bucks more and get a better 1. Have ordered the 6770 and have heard better reviews from that one so hopefully it'll do the trick."
1493,"It is nice enough on the back, but overlaps the front enough to cause the smart cover to not grip quite as well with the magnets.  On the side the smart cover still grips fine, but the when the cover is closed it slides just a bit causing the ipad to come on and drain the battery a bit.  If you're careful it isn't an issue."
1494,"Are sellers on Company A really allowed to call an item ""leather"" in the title when the product is absolutely NOT leather? I know the fine print says synthetic--it still doesn't make it right. Also, this case fits the Nook Color badly. The Nook Color is a shade taller than the case and sticks out the top."
1495,I first bought 1 of these product..very good it fits my kindle..looks and smell leather as advertised..i bought another one..the 2nd order is alrady made of cheap and poor quality synthetic..i reordered thinking ill be getting just like the first one..
1496,"I had hope for the extender but unfortunately it would not configure itself with the popular Linksys WRT54GL router I have. Albeit, I have custom firmware on it (it runs the popular Tomato). Still, as I kept researching in how to make it work, it turns out that it would take a lot of work and in the end if it did work I would likely have much lower throughput on it so I unfortunately had to return the product.On a positive note, I liked the small footprint and design."
1497,"Interesting what Google turns up - like charging 2X for the same box.Looks like a nice box, at 1/2 the price listed here. Not sure what improvements were made to the i5 from 2nd gen to 3rd, but for a donor Linux box, perfect at $360."
1498,"This is my second one of these, love the fit and thinness but they just don't last. I will avoid them for future purchases."
1499,"It is a Toshiba portfolio case, but it is nothing like what is pictured.  Instead of sliding the tablet into the case, the tablet snaps in under three tabs.  It seems well made, but is just isn't handy to use.  I should have sent them back."
1500,"Not that they were terrible, but just average. I replaced with the Sony MDR-V6 headphones, which have a better sound to me. Since I didn't purchase with Company A Prime (it wasn't available--private seller) , I had to pay freight back, which was about $10."
1501,This is the second set of G.Skill i bought and i didn't like it.One stick arrived dead so i have to return it. Got two sticks of Corsair and loving it.
1502,"I purchased this trackball only because Logitech does not have a left-handed wireless trackball. Unfortunately when I am within a document (doc,txt,rtf. etc) when I scroll down to the bottom, the curser immediately drifts up to the center. When I move the curser back down, it can be a challenge to enter new text before the trackball moves the curser back to the middle.In games &#34;right-clicking&#34; will do what it is suppose to do, and, it will also initiate other game functions. I would say that this mouse is disfunctional for both word documents and games."
1503,These hubs have poor power output characteristics.The power output fluctuates violently.If you plug in more than 3 devices that use the full amount of power specified in the USB2.0 standard the devices start to disconnect and return bad data.I attempted to use these hubs with Block Erupters for bitcoin mining but they were not able to power more than three of them per hub reliably.
1504,"When I have few usb's connected (4tb external, 3tb external, 2tb external, logitec tiny receiver for mouse & kbd.). Now if I'm in the middle of the process of copying, or anything that involves writing on the disk, it gets abrupted when I connect another USB eg. my 64gb usb flash, which is the 5th connection. Everything suddenly looses connection and reconnects. That's a major NO NO. if someone accidentally plugs in his ipod while I'm in the middle of some serious data transfer, I'm in trouble! I gotta now make sure no one plugs anything, each and every visitor & I have almost as many how many ports on this adapter per day."
1505,Tried soldering wires that broke where it came apart at but it kept coming apart where glued together and breaking the wires.
1506,"have owned my Px3's for a couple months, they were a replacement for my old PX21's. So far they have been nothing but troublesome, the USB wireless adapter likes to come unplugged from tthe back since its not very tightly put together, and just today I had to replace both clips on the top of the headset after only two months of light use, the threads for the screws in there fell apart as if they were made of jello. These are cheaply built and the more I use Turtle Beach products the more I see that. My PX 21's had some flaws in the same areas. Im frustrated for a $130 dollar product I expected more. The sound quality is good when they want to work with Windows, but often times they dont."
1507,"When connected to my laptop the item did charge the battery.  However, the tips that are used are way too loose and not labeled.  Made connecting a guessing game."
1508,"These headphones sound great and they have excellent noise cancellation on low-frequency sounds, especially fan noises or airplane noises. However, I intended to study with these but had to return them because unfortunately they do not block out higher frequency noises such as voices or paper shuffling. I wanted these to block out all noise so I could study in a coffee shop, but unfortunately a pair of cheap ear plugs performs better for this function. One thing I do not like about the cables Bose uses is that they are high impedance. I know they have a higher low setting, but even the low impedance setting is quite high and therefore I have to crank up the volume on an iPhone to achieve normal listening levels, I would say about 75 to 100% volume depending on the song. Another gripe I had was that considering the price of these headphones, the plugs or not gold coated so when you rotate the plug in an iPhone or computer, you get some distortion noises common on cheap headphones due to poor contact or transmission. Sound quality is on par with high-quality headphones such as the Dr. Dre beats Pro and Grado SR80i. I would agree with many other reviewers that these headphones have a good bass response but they're not for bass lovers. The bass is accurate, but you cannot really get a booming or bass thumping feel from them. The extra cable for iPhone remote microphone control is excellent, but I did not have an opportunity to test call quality with the inline microphone. The inline remote microphone also work with Apple computers. Unfortunately these did not fill my purpose, so I had to return them."
1509,"Just received my keyboard yesterday, after several attempts to connect it via bluetooth to my 3rd generation iPad it finally did.  The delete, R, L, Z and a few other keys worked sporadically.  Not sure if it's a compatibility issue or if its hardware related.  Either way, I'm returning it and going with the Kensington Keyfolio Pro 2 which was just recently reduced in price."
1510,"would loved to have liked this product if it had been new/unused and in original packaging...evidently it had been used previously...the battery tabs had been removed, alkaline batteries weren't at full strength do to use or shelf life...directions were poorly xeroxed copies... as this was fulfilled by Company A i had no problems in returning it...being afraid i would have the same problem with a replacement i chose a refund and ordered another product instead..."
1511,"I really wanted to like this and I wanted it to work. Perhaps the problem isn't with the VooMote but with the particular A/V components I have, although none of them are that old or strange brands. The crux of the problem is that during the programming process, none of the built-in codes worked. But when I tried to do the manual (and very tedious) programming, even those didn't work. Believe me I tried. Sometimes, I could get one of the buttons working but not others. Once I got one of the remotes to work and the for some reason it stopped working later.Maybe I'll try again when they update the iPhone app and see if begins working better. Because I really want this to work. I love the idea of it."
1512,"I wanted an inexpensive alternative to use with my DSLR. This isn't it.Pros: Lightweight and tripod-mountable.Cons: Doesn't slide smoothly. There is no tension when sliding so the footage rarely comes out as intended. The lack of tension means that there isn't consistent points of contact between the plate and the slider rails. SO, my Canon 60D and 50mm 1.8 mounted via a ball head will rock back and forth on the slider which really translates over to the footage."
1513,"The installation procedure is not intuitive, you have to expend several minutes to configure it properly. The WIFI signal, I installed this camera like 10 meters away ant its signal is better than my laptop. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t have the I/O alarm port as the pictures of the Company A site. The video and pan response is very slow when you use the higher resolution (640*480). The motion detection sometimes has problem (false positives or not detection). The audio functionality is poor, the input audio (microphone) is very bad and the other direction doesn&#8217;t work. The ActiveX mode doesn&#8217;t work in internet explorer 9."
1514,"My big complaint about this one is that when it is wet outside, it registers the water droplets (assuming) as something in front of the sensor."
1515,"The quality is questionable. It fits into my iPad no problem, but I get worried because it wiggles. It would take a while to read my sd card, and sometimes it would just hang. Other times it would just not read at all. When it does work, it would take forever to read images taken from a 12MP DSLR. It could take so long that it would significantly drain my battery."
1516,"It can't program Time Warner cable box or Yamaha receiver. There is no open/close button for DVD player either. I was able to program Samsung LCD TV and Sony DVD player, but that's pretty much it. When I contacted the customer service via chat, here is how it went.

1517,"Good (basic model) while it lasted. After less than 4 weeks it would not allow me to push buttons to enter address. If I pressed ""D"" it would enter ""3"", and the erase would not work. Would not recommend."
1518,"Unfortunately I did not purchase this charger at Company A.Fortunately caught it on time. 18650 IMR AW battries used. Charger takes 1 battery at a time no issue but 2 high drain battries at once you will detect over volt(smells of plastic). Those were 14 bucks batteries I trusted with ""Trust Fire"". I will consider their company with more care next time."
1519,"I was hoping that I would be one of the many happy customers of this hood. The item came, and I was worried that the product description on the packaging was written for Canon G-1x, but the bar code on the backside said for Fuji X100. When I opened the box, I was disappointed, as it was (I assumed) for the other camera. It was black in color and in petal shape, not circular and silver as depicted. I tried to mount it to my lens without success. I returned it. I wanted to buy another one but I don't feel like wasting my time returning the item shall they send the wrong item again."
1520,I had all sorts of issues getting this to work with my new Sony Vaio S with USB 3.0.  Most devices plugged in through this hub would not be recognized.
1521,I ordered these for my old TP1s and returned them immediately due to the stiffness and thinking there wasn't anything from Bose themselves for a product they stopped selling in 2010. Turns out they do still sell them if you ask -$35 plus tax and free shipping and they just clip into place. No tape to hold them on. Have a new pair of TriPorts. Just email Bose and they'll send you the link. Part # is 029176 but the Bose site no longer lists them and you can't search so email them for the link or call.
1522,"Product cooled my laptop down quite well, while it lasted. Not very comfortable, and USB power wire doesn't fit well. It's supposed to wrap around a couple little plastic arms hidden away under the device but they don't keep the wire secured and always come loose. This would just be a minor inconvenience, except that since the wire is meant to wrap around the bottom if you try to move the pad with your laptop you will probably get the wire caught on something. In my case it caught on the edge of my desk and pulled the wire from the tiny connector inside the cooling pad. It didn't even make a sound or give any noticeable resistance."
1523,"Doesn't really work well for HTPC purposes, as it goes to sleep & takes a significant amount of time to &#34;wake&#34; again. This makes it not very useful for quickly pausing, jumping back 10 seconds, or the like. Perhaps for other purposes, but I cannot see using it for controlling video at all."
1524,"I bought this case because of the good reviews, but found myself pulling it off my iPad days after having it! This case, first off has no kind of lining to protect the back of your iPad or the screen for that matter! It also seemed to get charged up with electrical static after a while, which I could no longer deal, so into the garbage it went... I would have requested a refund, but it just wasn't worth the effort!"
1525,"I have 3 Rokus.  One older model. I believe the XD.  Works great.  Has the 5Ghz range on it.  I now have the older model in my room which is on the far side of the house, so I have to run it on the 2.4.  Never had any issues. I bought a new roku2 xs.  Wireless does not have 5ghz at all and 2.4ghz stinks.  I cannot get HD on Company A or Vudu on the crappy wireless they have in the new model.  I have a wireless gateway(5ghz)  I plug the Roku 2 xs into via ethernet in order to get HD.  I figured it was just a fluke.  Since VUDU came out and ROKU refuses to support it on the older model. I bought another XS.  Big mistake.  The 2nd one is only 20 feet from the router.  I cannot get a consistent stream. Again I had to buy another wireless gateway and plug the roku into it using the wired connection.If you don't need any features like I do (some programming I like is only on the roku)  I would really pass and go with the boxe.  Company A is not available on the boxee.  Just these junk roku2's.Pass if you can. Old models GREAT.  New roku 2's  JUNK.  My career is a Network admin...so I not crazy.  The wireless they have in the new ones just isn't right."
1526,"Setup was easy, the deep color video processing brings out the best picture. The biggest performance increase over other streamers is on Hulu picture quality and the 5.1 from Netflix and Company A. And that is all that is good to report.The interface is chunky and sluggish to repond to the remote,I've seen lockups, freezes, and reboots when streaming from USB or private channel DLNA servers, and lockups on information channels,Picture quality can be awseome but it can also drop off at time, mosaic affects or fuzzy video (I'm using wired ethernet from ISP 15-19mbps down.)Jerky/strobing on pans in video.Stuttering in the sound in Angry Birds.Apart from the Netflix, Company A, and Hulu+, the rest of the hundred or so channels are padding that are available on web/tablet/smartphone.The gradient range (light to dark) from the player is not standard for video. This flaw is so fundamental it's shocking to see it in any commercially produced AV product. Darks are too dark, highlights to light. If I tweak the settings on my TV so the Roku's picture looks correct every other source/channel looks washed out and pale.It runs hot, even idling the temp is hot. It's the hottest thing on my AV stack, even when idle. Can't imagine it will last long running so hot.The warranty is only 90 days - to me, nothing screams cheap design, badly made, no quality control like a 90 day warranty. Other streamers, Blu-Ray players have one year warranties.I've noticed that many titles I watch on Netflix with 5.1 have AV sync issues, sound ahead of picture. I've since found out that it's a known bug in the last FW update Dec. 14th 2001. Now, coming up on 3 months and it's not fixed.There are other ongoing performance issues that could be considered bugs - check the forums.Overall, the Roku behaves like an underpowered smartphone. The support and design can't be all that good as the gradient range issue, HLS streaming bugs, 5.1 AV sync problem, and overall performance are unfixed since launch. For the price, it's terrible value for money for such a poorly designed and supported product. Blu-Ray players of the same price range are a better deal for streaming.It may be the only way to get 5.1 sound for Netflix and Company A but number of negatives is too much for me to put up with. If a blu-ray player comes along with 5.1 Netflix and Company A I will be send the Roku back.I upgraded to a Sony BDP-S590 and compared the two for a while. The choice was easy and the Roku went back."
1527,"I bought this drive about 9 months ago because it was relatively inexpensive, had a 6 GB/s connection and a 64 MB cache.  It is still working and has had no problems.So why two stars?  How can a drive manufacturer get by with a rating of 2400 power on hours?  That's just over one year at 8 hours a day, five days a week - or three months 24/7.  If I had dug far enough I would have discovered this before I made the purchase and I would have bought something else.  For instance an Hitachi drive with a rating of 2 million hours.  Maybe I'll be lucky but as I approach the end of rated life I'm nervous.  I'm making frequent backups.  Come on guys."
1528,I bought this because it was inexpensive.- It is slow loading Netflix... strike 1!- It had an audio &#34;vibration&#34; coming through the speakers... strike 2!- It was heavily pixelated and looked about as good as an up-scaled VHS player... strike 3!Returned it and bought a Roku 2 XS... VERY happy!
1529,"Plain and simple, I bought this unit to extend my range in a 2900 sqft Cape style home. Router was placed in the lower floor (same place as old router). The range was NO better than my old 655 or 615 router. In fact I think it was a bit decreased over the older 655 router. I would not recommend."
1530,"This keyboard would get a 5 star from me except for one flaw...the right upper case key is on the far side of the up,down, left and right keys that are the same size. I have not after a week of using this got my right baby finger to stretch to this upper case key of the same size and every single time hit the up key that stops my typing in its tracks. You will have to look every time unless this becomes your only keyboard. the rest of the keys are fine, the feel is ok, it is simi quiet with just a little noise while typing...It was easily detected on the xp and win 7 machine...it comes with a very small receiver that can plug into a usb port nearly unseen and take up about a quarter inch of space sticking out. this fits into the battery area of the keyboard for storage while on the road...and this battery case seems to come off and close...with average ease. the usb receiver has also a larger range extender that probably is just part of the antenna system with nothing active just more metal ticking out covered in plastic about another 1.5 inches. this part does not have a storage spot in the battery area of the keyboard. as you see, I am only using the left upper case key here as this one really is nearly impossible to get use to... the only near fatal flaw of this keyboard. the touch pad is about the side of a laptop with a cheaper feel to the surface...plastic texture feel, but seems to work well...I have not had to go into windows to see if it shows up with touch and feature adjustments as it seems to default ok with a tap on the keyboard for the left button, that I use....I have an electronics, tinkering background, so since I like this keyboard and the battery life states the battery will last a year...and there is a slide power switch at the top that is easily found to use...I will try to make the arrow keys all work as the right upper case key as will be needed unless you are a hunt and peck typist...good luck in the dim or dark...."
1531,looks good but is really cheap.  If used on a daily basis it really wore out fast.  Paid money for a better one
1532,This is cute trash. Its cute and colorful and novel. just dont use it.my second one my tire was stolen and the rims. It worked better than the first by a small margin. I buy corded so i dont drop and break them. I didnt even have to do that. My god baby liked the lights but i didnt let her handle it. Luckily so she could have choked on a wheel. I am disappointed I had to throw it away again. I love to vroom vroom. But this is the facts i got what i paid for and less. I am sure this can be made better. maybe if I crazy glued everything down first. sigh
1533,"This works sometimes if conditions are perfect.  A very good idea, but functionality is marginal.  Not really useable.  Don't recommend it."
1534,"Problem was, I have Mac Pro and this unit is set up for PC software, Won't work.  Set up for Smart Phone but not Mac.I'm sure this is a good product, but I really never got a chance to set it up.  The reason I returned it was because it was at that time almost impossible to set up with Mac  equipment.  This might be changed by now.This is a good example of why I buy at Company A.  If you have a problem of any kind, Company A will exchange it or refund it.  Easy to work with, I got my refund in about a week."
1535,"I purchased these to use myself on long commercial flights and for my youngest daughter to listen to music in our small airplane. Compared to other low cost noise canceling headphones, these were only marginal in their noise canceling performance. The battery compartment for the 2 AAA batteries is ridiculously hard to get to. And, they were flimsy at best. Worse, the failure mode is that the flimsy hinge requires two small screws screwed into to very small plastic posts. This is where my right ear cup hinge failed, and it failed while I was using them, not my teenage daughter. Believe me, I was not being rough with them. The two star was because it did come with a (cheap) carrying case that fit perfectly in the outer pocket of my carryon. If these had worked well, I was going to buy a second and third pair for the two sisters. I will buy another headphone for them, and because these are broke and now useless for noise canceling, I will have to replace them for the youngest daughter, too."
1536,"The headphones work great when they actually work! On my first pair I had to return them because the left earbud was blown. Then with the second pair I ordered the battery fried after only getting to use them twice. Like I said if the battery worked and I didn't get a faulty pair they would be great headphones. This time I'm not getting a replacement, I'm returning them for my refund."
1537,"So far I have not offered anything out of the ordinary from what I could have taken another HDMI cable, I think the best so far has been the price."
1538,"This system has excellent features for the price. The problem is it does not work correctly. I spent hours monkeying around with this Vulkano and reviewing the forums and the web. Maybe future software updates will make this work better but I am not going to wait. I am sending mine back to Company A. I very rarely send things back so his is a big deal for me.The Vulkano disconnects for the network on a regular basis. In my case this occurred only when the Vulkano was used to stream data. Recording and down loading content does not seem to cause this to happen. When the Vulkano does disconnect  it requires manual intervention at the Vulkano to reconnect. The system can be told to reconnect from the menu or it can be power cycled.  This makes the Vulkano useless if you want to watch programs remotely. My solution to this problem was to not use streaming. If I did stream by accident I immediately remotely rebooted the Vulkano. If the Vulkano does disconnect you can no longer remotely reboot the Vulkano. I think the Vulkano should automatically reconnect but it does not. My unit was connected via WiFi. Maybe this problem does not exist for hard wired connection.I attached a 160 G hard drive to the system, It worked for a while. After pulling the plug on the machine and reconnecting the power, the system no longer recognized the hard drive. The drive needed to be reformatted from my computed before I could try to use it again, I think that unless you have the Vulkano attached to a UPS you should not use a external hard drive.When I first setup the Vulkano the EPG did not work correctly. Depending on which computer I configured it with I would see different numbers of channels. On  one of my computer I could only get 2 channels. After about a week it did fill in but if I reset it and start over it goes back to 2 channels again.The transfer of programs sometimes hang and they have to be canceled and restarted. When you do this the transfer starts over from the beginning, If this is a big file it can take a while to transfer.The Vulkano is always on. There is no way to turn it off. To turn off you must pull the plug. The Vulkano generates a lot of heat.You cannot schedule a program to record all episodes. You have to go in each week and do it yourself. This will get very tiring.If you want to watch shows on your mobile device you much purchase the app. I tried the free one but it did not work. I did not try the pay one because I did not want to pay for it, if I was going to return the Vulkano.Technical support is not very helpful. I contacted them about the EPG. They said &#34;Don't worry about it&#34; we are working on it. That is the only thing they had to say. No sorry, No questions about anything I might have done to cause the problem.I think the way this solution works is the Vulkano connects to a remote server. When the Vulkano client wants to connect to the Vulkano they connect to the remote server and the server puts the client and the Vulkano in contact with each other. I don't really like depending on the middle man server. What happens when the server does not work anymore. I think it would be better if the user could directly connect to the Vulkano."
1539,"I bought this to replace a 7port Uspeed that wasn't working out for me. And this works good, where the Uspeed wouldn't and it arrived 6.5 hours after being ordered. Prime is so cool!!Update:I have some USB 3 drives permanently hooked to a PC. This hub dismounts the drives hooked to it every few days and you have to power cycle the hub to get them to remount. Not may favorite hub."
1540,"Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, WhiteI received my Kindle Fire on Nov. 15 and two Kindle Fire covers on Nov. 17.  Was intending to keep both covers,  but I returned this one as soon as UPS showed up at my door with the second cover - handed the driver the return package containing Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware.I really love Marware products.  I have two camera cases, one pda case and a Compaq 1000 laptop case made by Marware - all very good.This case had many problems.  First, getting the Kindle Fire snapped in or out was a mighty chore making me think I might break my Kindle after a few repeats of the procedure.Second, the case was lightweight (great), but made of very cheap plastic with sharp edges (bad).  Third,  the ""stand"" simply did not work properly and the Kindle would fall backwards on my living room cocktail table with a thunk.I DID keep the second cover which was a Marware jurni Kindle Fire Cover in red and it is awesome and worth every penny. (AT the time it was $10 cheaper than the Microshell - go figure)."
1541,"I bought this to charge my nexus 7 on, it won't charge it but will sync up via bluetooth. Sort of pointless... I then tried my ATT GS2 (i777) and that charges and syncs but the dock doesn't connect via the charging port, it actually uses bluetooth for some reason and my GS2 kept disconnecting and reconnecting.I'm returning this, it's pointless in my life because it won't charge my Nexus 7, and my phone the alarm on it is not reliable because because the bluetooth keeps dropping..."
1542,"I agree with the comments that without a separate woofer, this is very overpriced for the quality of sound.  It is better than the typical LCD TV, but not much better.  If you are going to buy it, buy the woofer. Although some reviewers claim that creates another problem.The sound is very unimpressive considering the price.  I have $32 computer speakers, Altec Lansing BXR1221 2, which do a much nicer job at $220 cheaper.  Unfortunately for me, my TV has no 3mm jack output, I have to use the new digital optical output, which precludes using computer speakers.In addition, I can not plug in a  3 mm jack to the Yamaha, and use a cheap and effective woofer.  The sub woofer output on the Yamaha surround bar is of some new variety that I am not familiar with and I find nothing which readily identifies how I would get a sub woofer output.Anyone reading this who knows the kind of output for sub woofer on this very modest but expensive piece of electronics will do me a big favor by telling me what it is."
1543,"So i got this on last black Friday was a great deal. worked fine, great audio, awesome features. right away i noticed the wireless receiver would disconnect for few seconds then connect back. i thought nothing of it, it happened every 3-4 days or so and for 1-3 seconds. but it kept getting worse until it became very frequent, every 20-30 mins and for longer periods of time till it stopped reconnecting and i had to unplug the usb and re-plug and sometimes that didn't even work i'd have to restart the computer. i thought the usb port is failing so i switched, didn't work, uninstalled re-installed drivers/ software downloaded upgrades, still kept happening. because it had to do with the usb i thought maybe it was the windows, formatted, fresh install, fresh drivers, still kept happening. i contacted creative they were VERY helpful and sent me a brand new one in the box still with the wrapper. worked perfectly.... for about 3 weeks, then started disconnecting, i thought ok its the motherboard...(even though this only happened with headphones and non of the other devices connected) i took headphones off and stored it because i didn't have enough money to get the mother board i wanted (asus maximus V formula) until last week i found it on sale and got it! installed it very excited, fresh windows install, fresh updated drivers and i went to grab my favorite headphones and only 3 days later it started again... by disconnecting i mean the wireless receiver would just turn off. if your listening to music it would stop, if your in a game ur sound goes out and u have no idea whats going on. and u literally have to either die in MP mode and reconnect the usb or u might have to shut down the game lose ur turn in the queue or disconnect from your friends party so u can restart, only to have it happen again in 20 mins! its verrrryyy annoying. and i cant imagine i got 2 defective units! what are the odds?!"
1544,"speed is decent, i like the durable design.it was good while it lasted, i really liked it.after a few months, it started to crap out.sometimes it gets detected, sometimes not.i have to keep replugging it into the port until it finally detects..i tried to file for a warranty/replacement, but then i haven't gotten any response back from corsair after a month or two now.."
1545,"The sound of the recorded video is kind of statics. It is exacerbated when you are going faster in the highway.The video quality is not impressive either, not to mention the horrible battery life and not being user friendly."
1546,"Disclaimer:  I like music, and some songs sound much better to me through headphones, but I'm not an audio expert in any way.  My review will be one for casual listeners like me, who comparison shop to get the best product for however much they are willing to spend.I was excited when I saw that these headphones were one of the choices on my Vine newsletter as right now I only have one pair of headphones and would like to have one pair to keep at work for when I work late or on weekends, and one pair for home.  I didn't care for the white color and black zebra stripes, but the fact that the list price was $99 made me think they'd have good sound and be well designed. I got out my inexpensive Sennheiser headphones (HD201 List price $29.95 but priced at only $17.58 on Company A  [...] so that I could compare them.CORD IS MUCH TOO SHORT:  After undoing all the twist ties to get them out of the packaging I was surprised to see how short the cord is.  I measured it - 43"".  At home I listen to music on my laptop, which is often on top of the ottomon in front of the chair where I sit (rather than on my lap.  The JBL cord is barely long enough to reach the input jack on the side of the laptop when I have the laptop on the ottomon.  If I go to the office on weekends I take my laptop and place it off to the side of my work area - the work area being where I have files and the keyboard for my office computer.  The JBL cord is definitely not long enough for me to plug into my laptop and be able to move freely at my desk. I measured the Sennheiser cord and it is 116 inches, which allows me to plug them into my laptop and move around freely in my desk chair without even thinking about them.  Given the length of the cord, I think these JBL's would only be usable with an MP3 player or smart phone that was on the listener's lap, or on an arm band, or in a shirt pocket.YOUR HEAD MIGHT BE TOO BIG FOR THESE:  After plugging them into my laptop, I pulled each side to fully extend it from the over the head part as I do with my other headphones.  After I do this, I position them on my ears and pull the over the head piece down to a comfortable position. I have an average size head, and when these JBL headphones are fully extended the ear pieces fit comfortably over my ears.  But when the cheaper Sennheiser's are fully extended they reach 1.5 to 2 inches further down on each side than the JBL's - so the cheaper ones extend 3 to 4 inches further in total and as a result are much more likely to be adjustable to sit properly on your ears.  The pads on the JBL ear pieces are round and measure just short of 3 inches in diameter. The JBL padding takes up all but about an inch (diameter of circular area)of the inside of each ear piece. By comparison, my cheap headphones have earpads that are about 4 inches tall and 3 inches across with the unpadded, open area on the inside 2.5 inches tall and 1.5 inches across.THE OVER THE HEAD PIECE HAS NO PADDING:  I wouldn't want to wear these for very long given the lack of padding.POOR POSITIONING OF THE VOLUME CONTROL: There is a hard plastic volume control piece located 4.25 inches below one of the ear pads.  I tried using it and could detect absolutely no difference in volume after pushing each of the two volume buttons six or seven times in a row.  The volume control feels very cheaply made.  Though my cheap headphones don't have volume controls at all, I would expect a volume control to be located somewhere lower on the cords and thus easier to reach.Given how poorly these JBL's compare to the much cheaper Sennheiser HD201 headphones, I don't understand why these JBL headphones are priced at almost $100.  It's possible that the sound quality of the JBL's is vastly superior to that of the Sennheisers, and that it's a difference which I cannot detect but other people might. The white color and black stripes would be appealing to a lot of kids under ten years old but I would guess they would find the over the head part uncomfortable."
1547,"I bought this item back in April, The connector was not soldered in well and quickly stopped working. I returned it and got a new one back, I got the same problem.  It is cheaply built but has good writing speed while it worked. If you want to buy it I hope you are planning to use it in stationary mode, by which i mean you wont move it a lot.I wouldn't buy this again since i want something i can reliably transport around and this has turned to be quite the let down in that aspect.I really can't recommend this to anybody as a portable external hard drive."

1549,"Who wants a black, brushed aluminum gizmo with a dent in it? Not I. Back it went.The replacement charged my iPhone 5 just find until it went to sleep (its LCD battery gauge blanked out). At that point.. no charging. I don't want to keep on clicking the button on the side to wake it up, so this one's going back too."
1550,This usb kit could be better made.  Does the job for now but not stable. Make sure you dont bump it.  Does not stay firmly in.  Its the best you have to work with till they make it better....unless you need it...wait till they improve on it.
1551,Difficult to attach and screw threads need to be added and more pronounced.  Can not use it as it is designed!  Waste of money.
1552,"When you get the angle of these things correct, they are awesome.  They were cheap and are great for giving large files to friends.I have 2 issues.  The first is be warned that the shipping is applied per item.  It may be easy to look at these and think that you can buy a dozen and pay nothing, but you will pay an absurd price FOR EVER ONE.  Then, all arrived together in one little dirt cheap plastic delivery bag.  I was not happy.  I complained to the company and they refund me partially, but I still ended up paying over $30 for about $4 worth of shipping.The other thing is that I often had troubles getting them to line up with my MacBook Pro.  They went in, but wouldn't respond until they were angled just right.  I then would be very careful to keep them in that position."
1553,"Bought this to replace my Sansa clip. Very great concept but needs a lot of tweaking to work out the problems.Left a detailed review on here about my experience with it already. Continued my search and discovered Phillips Raga. Happy with my raga, goodbye Sansa clips!"
1554,"I'm extremely disappointed with Asus for shipping this product. As the owner of numerous Asus computing products including monitors, netbooks, motherboards, and network hardware, I am stunned to see the poor quality of design in the UX21 notebook. Intel have cultivated the ""ultrabook"" designation to compete with the renowned performance and reliability of Apple's Macbook Air; what we got with the UX21 seems more like it was slapped together as a trade show demo and then never revised.The executive summary: there is a *deafening* 60 Hz buzz from the 1/8-inch audio jack, on AC or battery. I have tested with half a dozen other computers, smartphones, music players, and a tablet on the same speakers and headphones, and ONLY the UX21 produces the buzz. Both the original and the replacement units produce the buzz. In 2011 this is an inconceivably embarrassing defect.If you want to listen to music on this computer, you can safely rule out purchasing it right now. On to the details.I'm reviewing a second, replacement unit, having confirmed the same problems in the replacement as I experienced with the first one, which is already on its way back to Company A.Battery runtime for me has been about 60% of the nominal rating. I understand that battery ratings tend to be inflated, but I have not seen this level of exaggeration in any Asus marketing or even in other manufacturers' marketing. I've set the backlight to the minimum brightness value, turned on every power-saving feature in the operating system, disabled wireless and bluetooth and removed everything from every USB port... there's no 5-hour runtime in this battery. I last clocked it at 2 hours, 51 minutes. I don't know how much work you expect to do with less than three hours of battery, but I'd consider that more of a toy.Inserting and removing the power plug is a terrifying and risky experience. The first time I unplugged it while the machine was running (and a second time, later, the next day) the machine powered down instantly. This is obviously not what you want when you are getting up from your desk to go give a presentation. Numerous times I've pulled or inserted the power, only to see any USB device plugged into the adjacent USB port suddenly power off. The only condition I found to revive that USB port was a full shutdown and subsequent cold boot of the system.The VGA port sounded lovely on paper. And it kind of works... except that the output is as blurry and as noisy as running a real VGA port with 10-foot cable. And that suspending the machine with an external monitor plugged in occasionally produces a hard lockup of the OS (again, requiring a full shutdown and cold boot).The touchpad is a cheap Sentelic knockoff; as others have noted you'll need to install the bleeding-edge alpha drivers immediately upon receiving the system. If you're used to Synaptics touchpads, you're in for a rude awakening. Sentelic have several years of work to do before they can catch up to the market leaders. I really wish Asus had shipped this with a Synaptics pad, instead of this irritating B-list piece of crap.There are a few positive things about this system. The keyboard is nice to type on, and continues in the same vein as Asus's previous keyboards on small laptops. The display, while not quite up to the standard of competitors' IPS panels, is of acceptable quality. The size and weight of the system are perfect, and are even close enough to those of the 11-inch Macbook Air that it can fit in most cases designed for that system.The SSD is extremely fast. Boot times with this system are stunning. And that's a good thing, because given how poor the rest of the hardware is, you're going to be rebooting it all the damn time."
1555,"I'd been using a pair of in-ear headphones, and wanted to try something different.  Not sure why.  Came up with these thru a Google search.The wrap-around cable has a stiff wire in it, which allows it to keep its shape behind your ear.  Personally I found this to wear at the back of my ear and got uncomfortable after a few nights wear.  The flat part is also not soft and can sometimes hurt a little when you lie on it (on your side) depending on what kind of pillow you use.  They also fall off quite easily.  Toss and turn just a little even against a down pillow case and they'll work themselves off, despite carefully shaping them, even making them quite tight around my ear.Meh.  Might work well for others though."
1556,"I was kind of surprised at how cheaply made this thing is. Yes, it will cover your iPod, but it cracks easily and it looks... well... less than impressive.Why would someone buy this?How can they justify asking 20 dollars for this thing?These are just a couple of the existential questions I was left to ponder after receiving my Belkin Essential 034 Case."
1557,"I liked the  way it worked under the conditions it had to work under :1) A used  refurbished computer - that  needed the broken CD-ROM repaired.2)HP WEBCAM Software therefore not properly installed on computer from its CD .I couldn't therefore  get proper internet connection for the webcam to do its job,because the Webcam (which  still worked)had to operate with bad  equipment.Send another review in May 2014 - then I will be able to give a much better report - for I will have a new  computer - with a CD-DVD ROM - which the webcam will be able to properly function, for a decent review. 4/4/14"
1558,"It's been about 4 months, and the power supply is already loose and breaks contact.  I can't charge my batteries at all with it.  I've gotten a lot of Opteka stuff in the past, but this is the first time I've been disappointed... Wish I could return it!"
1559,"Based on other reviews, I thought these would be the answer to my earbud dilemma on the long, long flights home, sitting in coach, of course.  Probably center seat, with a screaming baby behind me. Yes, I need a good set of earbuds. Unfortunately, these are not the ones. They are okay, but not great. My search continues for a noise cancellation set of earbuds."
1560,"I'm going to save you all some time and tell you that I wouldn't recommend these headphones.They do look pretty cool, a little bit retro, a little bit futuristic.  But that's all they've got going for them.  To begin, they fit awkwardly.  There's a good reason that well designed headphones pivot on more than one axis -- human heads are shaped funny.  These headphones don't allow for that, and the result is that the sound doesn't come through as well, they feel odd to wear, and they started hurting my ears after a while.They look like over-ear headphones, but they're not, unless you've got the world's smallest ears.  Instead, they sit on the ears, and because they only have one point of movement, it's not a smooth fit.  There are plenty of points that bear the brunt of the pressure, so that it doesn't take long for these headphones to start hurting.  I was also continually re-adjusting them, trying to get them in a more comfortable position.The sound is decent.  It's better than iPod headphones, but it's nothing particularly special.  I have another pair, also smaller ones like these, that are better.  The clumsy way that the headphones wound up smashing my ears muffled the sound.The last thing I want to note is with relation to construction.  There's a wire that runs from either side of the band that connects the headphones to the headphones themselves, completely exposed, where it would be easy for some accident to break it."
1561,"I waited until after my Kindle Fire arrived to order a case for 2 reasons1) I wanted to get a feel for the device before I decided what I needed2) Based on my experiences with my other tablets, first run cases are usually pretty basic and overpriced, so I wanted to see what else would come outAfter my Fire came I quickly relized I didn't feel safe just throwing it in my purse without any protection. I ordered a sleeve and this Company A Basics stand, thinking that Company A knows their products and is usually smart enough to see what works well with existing ones before they come out with or promote their own.Verdict:a) This thing is too bulky. It's not the most efficient design at all. You could come up with something equally safe and equally useful that doesn't make it so huge. The Fire all on its own is a little thicker and heavier than it needs to be, and when you add this case, it's like carrying around a brick. On my iPad I have a case with a built-in keyboard and that entire thing is still slimmer than the fire with this plain case.b) The elastic holders are too tight. They are so tight that once you get the Fire wedged in, you are constantly afraid it will pop back out. This is not so nice.c) Does the stand work? Kind of. Friction might hold it in place, but it seems like the Fire plus the case backing are too thick for the grooves in the stand. Mine slid right out of the most upright one immediately.$25 was tempting for a case - real leather! Company A! But no. $25 is way too much if you immediately hate the case. I'm still deciding if I might return it. I've ordered one of the other brands (which has the hand holding strap on the back and fewer parts) and until it gets here I will probably just carry the Fire in the sleeve I'd ordered (Vertek).Please note, I have used a number of tablets with a variety of different types of cases and covers and this is the worst bulk to device ratio I have ever seen. Very disappointed."
1562,Do knuckleheads at ZyXEL know that WEP2 requires 8 character minimum password? Then do not ship it with default passoword: &#34;1234&#34;.I cannot connect to it up as my devices check for WEP2 compliance so they will not let me click &#34;submit&#34; if passowrd is too short by standard. I do not use PCs so I cannot connect with Ethernet (have you seen one on modern tablets or smartphones?)I give it two starts for general design and form factor.
1563,"Item consists of a set of micro usb accessories and an absolute rubbish key fob. I recently purchased a 4GB SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip audio media player for my wife and since this item was available with Company A Prime shipping I opted to purchase it as well. The power adapters are suitable and do function properly but the USB to Micro-USB data transfer cable is a dismal failure. Although the data transfer cable does indeed power up the SanDisk Sansa audio player the device is always unrecognized by the PC. However, the cable that came included with the SanDisk media player always functions properly. Since the power adapters do function and I currently require auxiliary power for the device I shall not be bothering to return the set because of one defective item and shall purchase a more reliable replacement cable. I found that the 9 inch cable that was included with the Sansa audio player is far too short to suit my needs and I shall be ordering another 6 foot data transfer cable asap."
1564,"This came with UK firmware. A software push KINDA made it work. Can receive calls, but not place outgoing. Customer support not the best. Waiting for new firmware push."
1565,"This was recommended highly but was difficult for me to use -- I don't have the steadiest of hands & couldn't get the plastic cover onto the Kindle. Nor could I figure out how to get it to stand properly. Instead I cut a hole in the styrofoam in the box the Kindle was delivered in, & wedge the Kindle Fire in to watch video. I do keep the Kindle in the case, and do like the notebook design. I'm a reluctant Kindle user to start with, so my liking the notebook design maybe relates to my preference for real books with real covers, spines & pages."
1566,"Was able to power an iPad 4 using a genuine Apple lightning cable for a few times. Now I plug it in and the iPad says &#34;not charging&#34;. I plug the same iPad and cable in a wall charger and it works fine. Either this device's circuitry has failed or the iOS 7 update is more picky about the charger. It's been awhile since I upgraded to iOS 7, so I can't say for sure where the problem is. Bottomline is that it no longer works. Seems to still work to charge non-Apple USB devices though."
1567,"This product stopped working two days after I started using it. I got a good price and it looks good, but looks only go so far. Normally I would not leave such a review, but I need a car charger, because I travel frequently. Not worth the cost of returning, either."
1568,I was super excited to get the anti-glare and scree protector applied. I followed the directions but couldn't get the alignment to work. There was always a space at one edge which prevented the protector from being fully applied.Also the small piece of cardboard that was provided to push the bubbles out was pretty worthless.I wouldn't recommend this product. At least I was only out $4.
1569,"I received this case while i was still waiting for my backordered prime.  I received the prime and tried it in the case and the case doesn't function properly.  Will be sending back for refund and trying another. On a scale of 1-5: Quality-4, Fit-2, Finish-2."
1570,"So, the original charger lasted about 3 years without a problem, then suddenly had a short at the plug end.  I bought this one to replace it.  The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Company A) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."
1571,The lights stands are very cheaply made and get knocked over all the time.  The lights are only for flash ... some come with both flash and constant light.  I would not recommend these lights.
1572,This doesn't really fit the kindle fire hd.  It does cover the main part of the screen but not the whole thing.
1573,"This is a great concept. I was simply looking for a surge protector and an extra wall adapter to charge my iPhone. Didn't realize I could get them both in one small device! However, neither USB port will charge my Blackberry Torch. I was a little disappointed about that. But it does charge my iPhone and all other outlets do work. So, I can only give it two stars because it doesn't support all the devices it claims. Oh well, still a good price."
1574,"I am finding little use for the battery so far. There are plenty of adapters so most phones and computers are covered. However, the charge for a laptop has been less than ideal.I do not find it a worthy substitute for a second computer battery."
1575,"The ThinkPad 2 tab is probably THE nicest Win8 tab out there right now.  It's very slim and light, it's fast, and it sounds good.  I love the stylus and it's just a great companion that is starting to take over for my small laptop on trips.  But this case, ugh.  The ports are hard to reach, it triples the thickness of the tab, and it feels like it's almost three times heavier.  Also it's VERY hard to get in and out of the case.  It's too bad there isn't something more like Apples magnetic smart cover for the TP2.  This case works, if that's all you want.  And I like the folio type elastic strap to close it.  But this tab deserves better."

1577,Three of these Kindle AC charging units were purchased to be used with Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; Christmas presents.  Only two of the Kindle AC charging units worked . . . the third unit will not supply charging power to the attached Kindle Fire HD.  I have not contacted Company A about the defective Kindle AC charging unit but I plan to do so!
1578,This is not worth the price paid for it. It did not charge any faster than the original Kindle charger did. It get very warm when you use it and it covers two pluggins. I would not recommend this as a purchase...
1579,"NZXT Phantom 410 Mid Tower Gaming CaseIn general:I purchased this case several months ago for a family member who requested it and against my better judgement. I tend to agree with other reviews that the paint work is fragile on the plastic parts. The hard drive(s) and optical drive(s) tool-less design is an inexpensive and insecure method to retain drives to trays for the bays. The single included case fan is not really adequate for effective cooling of enthusiast peripherals. The fan controller is a nice feature assuming there was more than one fan included with the case. Grommets included with the case to shield power supply wires passing through the metal partitions are not at all satisfactory. The case door, assuming it is integral for aesthetics, is annoyingly cumbersome to anyone who needs frequent access to the drive bays and or ports it conceals.In Conclusion:The overall design of the case is somewhat attractive when compared to corporate boxes, is large enough to house the biggest graphics cards, and provides USB 3.0 ports. On the other hand, adding fans, functional grommets, screws for drive trays, and abrasion resistant coatings on plastic parts would improve the characteristics of this chassis. The bottom line is, there are better cases offered by other vendors for slightly more money, and believe me, the extra 30 or 40 USD will warrant the extra expense and lower the grief level of having to go out and purchase additional parts. In the same respect, there are better 100 USD cases offered by other vendors. In reality, a gamer who spends around 1000 USD on just graphics cards is not likely to purchase this 100 USD chassis."
1580,The camera takes good pictures and has a fast shutter.  I returned this item because the camera processing/writing to disk takes at least 3 seconds.  This was in all modes that I used.
1581,"I dont keep very high standard for laptops and was looking for a workable laptop for browsing, documentation, music etc etc. The laptop does the job, but the cons are the following:1. The touchpad buttons are noisy, its been 2 months and there is an effort to do the right clicks and its noisy, u can feel and hear the button press2. Getting WiFi after getting off sleep mode takes more than 2 mins. I have 2 other computers and both connect in a zap, but not this one.3. I also find the laptop to be slow in general.Not happy with the purchase, should have picked the Toshiba."
1582,The place that was supplying this took to long so I bought a different case from someone else.The case I bought is a Moko but not a angle stand type.
1583,"Nice keyboard, very fast ...But when will manufactures stop putting glossy screens on laptops!? I don't want to see myself in the screen, I want to see my documents. Please give us a MATTE screen!EDIT-Used the laptop for 3 days and returned!The screen is just too glossy and too dim to use. A white background looks blueish and makes text hard to read. Then there is the fan. I am a serious user, and the fan was just humming at a high pitch that gave me a headache. Between the screen and the fan, I was unable to look at anything electronic as I had an eye ache and ringing in my ears.I moved to a samsung np530u3c - the screen on that is soo much brighter, and matte. The difference is literally night and day.However the folio had a better keyboard, was backlit and the battery lasted much longer. But in the long run, it doesn't matter how long the battery lasts, if I can't stand to stare at the screen."
1584,"Great case for the price and compared to others a better deal, its slim and has a hand strap which I actually find very useful. I am not sure what the elastic strap is for though. It can't be for keeping the case in a closed position since the middle clip/tab does a pretty decent job of it. Might be for keeping the back cover in a folded postion and prevent it from flapping around but then the strap has to be streched over the tablet and it covers bit of the screen... and its very tight for that anyways. The closing clip/tab takes a bit of stretching and flexing the case to be able to slip over the tablet edge and close. Overtime it has become a bit easier to close but still a very tight fit... other than tht it works fine and keeps your tablet cover closed safely. I would also like Poetic to provide colour options for the cover other than black. My wife has the white tf300 and the black cover sort of spoils the awesome looks on that one, no complaints with my navy blue one though.Overall I am quite happy with the product. Would be five stars if they provide one in white and do something with the closing tab.Update: The cover has become useless after I forgot it in my car one day. It was hot outside and although the car was under complete shade with no direct sunlight coming in the car, the case along with the clip and holders warped beyond recognition!!! Beware, this is not the product to have to protect your tablet from any level of elements. However for the price I think it should have atleast held up to summer heats in the shade. As I found out the same product is sold for $5 in some other parts of the world."
1585,"The admin tool for this router lacks a lot of features I'd like to see.  The traffic shaping feature doesn't seem to have any real effect--I tried to set a low QoS for BitTorrent traffic and it doesn't actually work.  Overall, the UI just doesn't shape up to the Linksys routers.Whenever I come home from work, my iPhone connects and starts syncing iCloud data, etc.  My roommate will instantly moan about how his ping goes through the roof on whatever kill-everything game that he's playing at the time--and he's not on wireless.  Most of these mobile devices open up a huge amount of simultaneous TCP/IP connections when they see a wireless connection, since they're basically holding their breath while on cellular data networks.  I can only surmise that this router is not up to the challenge.This makes me a sad panda."

1587,"We've had this case for about 6 months and it's falling apart, cracked and ripped at the edges. I wouldn't buy it again"
1588,"I bought this &#34;8GB&#34; drive to install a 7.7 GB Image for work. Kingston is a known name to me and the small package size made it convenient, and the metal case seems like it would stand up to the rough treatment that I would be subjecting to this device.  Arrived quick and was a nice snug fit in the port.The image failed to install, because the drive had 7,26 GB's of space."
1589,"I often need to play video in professional presentation (conference room setting), so I need a speaker that is portable and has significantly more volume than a laptop.  I tried this because of the good reviews and it's relatively small size.  But I am disappointed at its volume.  Of the ones I own, the Logitech Z305 has the best volume, fills a room of 20 ~ 30 people.  But it's big and heavy and makes my 15"" laptop screen topple over.  Second best is X-mini.  Making this one a third.  I didn't expect that.  I was hoping it's more on the scale of Logitech Z305."
1590,"Radio works easily, Video is great, install was was pretty easy.  Thought I could buy their droid phone adapter to take advantage of the App features, but that was a bust, only works with Iphone.  Oh well, I'll do better next time.  Love Pioneer products but this fell way short."
1591,"When i first got it i immediately hooked it up to replace my old Belkin router, which i felt was out of date so i decided to buy this to replace it. I didnt think much of it at the time but i realized that my main desktop in my work room had lost internet connection completely. However my laptop was just fine which was connected via wifi to the cisco. Went on and when my son decided to start using the laptop while i was working the internet connection would cut out on my main desktop completely. I couldnt use it at all, and it would go back and forth, mine would work.. but then my sons would go out on the laptop and vice versa. As if the two were fighting over bandwidth. I then contacted cisco to see what they could do. They had me change the IP address to the router and then it seemed to be working just fine. NOPE.. it continued however the main desktop never fully disconnected and the speed was horrendous. Needless to say, i had to return the router. I enjoyed it very much and it worked great, its broadcast of wifi was much greater than my previous router, however this one caveat was too great. Guess the old saying goes &#34;If it aint broke, dont fix it.&#34; Lesson learned."
1592,"I previously reviewed the Magellan eXplorist 510 Handheld GPS here (http://www.Company A.com/Magellan-eXplorist-510-Waterproof-Hiking/product-reviews/B003Y5H17I/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_2?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&pageNumber;=2&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending).My wife uses the 510 for her Girl Scout Troop, but I was curious enough to try out the 110 to see if it was worth saving a few bucks.  Well, yes and no.For one, I miss the built-in camera functionality that the 510 had.  The 510 had a built-in 3.2 MP camera; this one did not.  This model is purely for getting around, but if you're expecting a more all-in-one functionality that combines hiking and memory-making, look elsewhere.Secondly, the buttons - my biggest gripe.  The 510 has touch-screen functionality that makes it easy to use.  The buttons on the 110, however, border on GPS-flinging frustration...they're soft.  And I mean SOFT.  I feel like I have to mash the dang thing just to have it respond, although sometimes I wonder if it's the lag time on the device or whether or not I'm pressing hard enough.  The middle button is also a little bit finnicky as well.  I have big thumbs and using the center button to navigate menus is a little difficult.  The center button actually rests higher than the base of the device (inexplicably) which makes translation movements a little bit awkward.  With the buttons, this device lacks the weather resistance on the 510 as well.For an entry-level device, however, it does have geocaching (premium account available at cost) as well as trial maps loaded in along with hunt/fish locations.  It works well in this regard although, like the 510, the compass functions well based on a moving target...don't expect it to point north when you're stationary.  The display is also fairly decent but claims that it looks great in direct sunlight may be a little overblown.However, given that the price point for the 510 is about $130+ more, you get a lot more functionality out of the 510 to make it worth your while including weather resistance, etc.  Check out my review there for the ""more"" that it can do.  I'd personally recommend the 510 over this model."
1593,"Camera seemed to work well at first. But after I bought the Blue Iris software and started using some of it's features, in this case... panning and tilting. I found that every time the camera would pan left it would shut down and reset. Something is wrong inside it. Sadly I found this out too late for an exchange. so it is an expensive &#34;stationary&#34; version."
1594,"OK, first off, the plusses.  It sort of works as a stand.  It sorts of works somewhat better with smaller tablets-- e.g., the iPad Mini.  You can, sort of, make some adjustments of the legs and the back prop.  But, if that sounds way short of a ringing endorsement, that's because it is!Several problems with this stand.  As some of the more discerning reviewers have pointed out, it is unstable--at least it is if it is on a dining room table cloth.  Perhaps the underside grippy things help on an uncovered desk.  At it stands (or doesn't! :-)), it wobbles and can easily tip over.  I've tried it with both an iPad Air and an iPad Mini.  It works better for the smaller tablets, but switching between the two is a nuisance!  The feet need to be splayed out as far as they can go to get even a modicum of stability for the larger tablet, but then the mini tablets can't fit; they'll fall between the legs (portrait).Move the stand with the tablet and it's almost sure to fall over!  This morning, I even had grabbed the upright prop part with the iPad, and moved it over.  No problem, I naively thought.  All of a sudden, it fell over on its side!Another big issue.  Lift your tablet and the darn stand often sticks to it!Another problem... there is no felt covering on the top side of the feet where the tablet rests.  It has the felt on the front top side, but not the back!  It needs a better design so that the entire area is covered.  You can see that on some of the clones (or, wait-- this is a clone)--those have the felt on the back and front.  I know that a different stand (a mini-plastic easel) scratched the edge of my Mini because the hard plastic dug into it.  So, felt covering is important.  On both this and that, one can cut out and put some sticky felt strips on to cover things, which generally solves the problem.  Not elegant, but it works pretty well.Amazingly, overall, this stand is *worse* than the $2.99 mini-adjustable easel stand we bought at Jo Ann Fabrics!  That stand has an easy to adjust back frame, which means it is easy to change the viewing angle--it smoothly goes to any angle you want.  This stand does not work well.  Both the backing and the feet cannot be smoothly moved into another position-- instead, there are notches and you have move from one set gap to another.  When moving the feet, it even seems as if one is going to break a notch!I'd return this to Company A, but at its low price, it's not worth the time, hassle, mailing, or effort."
1595,"I was really hoping to like this thing because who wouldn't want a tidy spot to charge up small electronics?  The cord for this charging station is heavy duty, so it's not very easy to snake around things and to shape to the wall and that sort of thing.  This device has three USB charging ports and two regular plug-in outlets (AC outlets).  Philips has given this device a slide out side tray to hold your larger tablet or iPad-type device.  I don't have one of those, so I can't say how that worked out.First of all trying to figure out how to best wrap my cords around the cable management clips was a pain.  You can pop off the clip and wrap it apart from the charging station, but then you have to try to pop it back onto the tray without undoing your work.  And then once you do that, just hope that you wrapped the cable in a way that makes sense once you plug your small electronic device in on the charger.The tray that covers up the cable management area only flips up, it doesn't come off, so it is nearly impossible to manage those cords without cursing the pop up panel since it doesn't remove from the charger.  This home charger takes up a fair amount of space on my kitchen countertop.  More than I'm willing to give it.  It measures 8 3/4""x 8 3/4"" and is about 1 1/2"" thick.  That plus the big fat power cord to supply juice to all of the devices that need charging.This device is supposed to help you save energy because it automatically shuts off after six hours of charging.  Once it shuts off, you have to push the power button to get another six hours.  I never needed to charge anything for that long, so I just unplugged my small electronic device when it was fully charged and I was done.  I think I would look into one of those power mats without all the cords if I really needed something like this.  This thing is too much work for me and my needs."
1596,"I bought this to replace the pads of a sennheiser px100 headset.  5 pairs is nice, but they fit so poorly, I'm going to use all of them up within a year."
1597,"1) The rubber tip itself is very small and shallow. With very little pressure the metal ring that holds the tip in place is touching the screen. It doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to see that regular use will scratch the screen.2) Chrome-plated plastic clip breaks easily. Why not use a metal clip? If the clip is decorative, it is useless.3) The shiny look of the stylus itself gives it a cheap look. The stylus also feels cheap in the hand.4) A quick side-by side comparison with a rival stylus helps the buyer see how poor the quality of the materials are.5) Why not make one well made stylus for the money instead of shipping 6 cheaply made styli? This is the most baffling part of your business model.I feel like I'm going to scratch my screen using these because the rubber tip is quite shallow and size of it is small. So it seems like the metal behind the tip is not far from digging in. You definitely can't use this at an angle so you can't use it with drawing apps.*My advice: Buy a Bamboo stylus. It's worth the extra money and you can buy replacement tips.I am a product designer by trade and can spot a poor design, poor construction and cheap materials when I see them. I also must note that I am not a person who goes on miserably leaving bad reviews. My average review is 4-5 stars.***PS If you are another dissatisfied customer, PLEASE vote my review up so people can learn the truth about this product."
1598,"There are a lot of known wifi issues with this player, but since I have my computer connected to my home theater that wasn't an issue for me.However, this unit really had a problem with skipping and hitching.  Being new to blu ray I didn't know if this was the player or the discs, but after it happened enough I concluded it was the player.  I probably got a bad player.  I bought a different brand and no more problems with skipping."
1599,"Bought this to retrieve data off of my very old hard drives sitting around in my desk drawer for about 5 or six years.  It came nicely packaged.  It fit my old drives.  However, the power switch kept shorting out causing the retrieval process to either stop or restart.  The construction of the device was pretty cheaply done...nothing really sturdy about it.  The two positive things I have to say are:  1) The return was easy; and, 2) It had a usb 3.0 (which to me is just a nice thing not a necessity).  Otherwise, I bought a different one with a lower price that worked much better and was of better construction."
1600,I had purchased this for reading and editing files (PDF) purposes only.Cons.:* Crashed too often.* Not enough memory.* A bit too heavy for my own taste.* Had problems with apps.  Wouldn't run.I believe this is more an expensive toy for a spoiled kid.
1601,Worked for about two weeks.  Used it on 2 seperate computers. Same effect .  Charged half the time then would just quit .  Got way too hot and needed time to cool.  Was cheap so got what I paid for
1602,"They just work for few months. I always keep them in a save place to avoid problems with the wires and only use 4 or 5 hours a week at the gym. I bought a wireless, this kind of wired product are cheap but don't last more than few months."
1603,"I'm using this in my iPad 2, which is the same dimensions as the iPad 3 -- just a little thinner. It fits fine but does tend to slide around very slightly inside the case.The case itself is nice; black, fairly plain, with a magnetic closure. Of course, the keyboard is the big deal here, though, right?Well, when I received this item, one of the keys was already broken off, which didn't speak to its long-term durability. And while the keyboard itself is nice and light and attaches (or detaches) easily from the case with velcro tabs, I just don't find I'm using it as much as I should. I don't tend to leave it in the case, because I'm afraid of it getting bumped (I have three small kids whose main goal in life is to steal my iPad), and so if I want to use it, that means I have to go find it, attach it, go into ""settings,"" turn on Bluetooth and pair the keyboard and the iPad. (I don't leave Bluetooth on all the time because it makes my battery life sink like a rock.)So, honestly, I find that most of the time when I think, ""Gosh, a keyboard would be nice right now!"" ...I still mostly just end up using the on-screen keyboard. And this case is too pricey (fortunately, I received a free one to review) unless you're VERY sure you're going to use the keyboard on a regular basis. Maybe if you're really careful with your things, you have a place to keep the keyboard nearby, and you can frequently charge your iPad, it would work well for you."
1604,i went to best buy to get this card i though i enjoy XFX cards but i was wrong i have a XFX Radeon HD 6770 and working great at 100% only 300watts Reguire. i have a 875 power watt and i plug in everything correct for the XFX Radeon HD 7770 after spending $184 from best buy the card lastes 1 week then cause the computer restart 4 times and screen kept disappearing. i thought it was a bad card i went back replace it with a new one next thing u know 1 week later same problem i turn my card back in and told them the story i have enough ram CPU power psu power everything was new in that computer it was just built and still the graphic card couldn't do its job the fan was soo slow i even tune it and have it full  but still nothing ima go with diamond  card and give that a try. im not going to deal with XFX no more i even wrote a complaint about the card to the XFX website i haven't got no Response from them after 4 days.....
1605,"This case provides minimal protection. It's better than just carrying around your camera naked, I suppose, but only barely. It doesn't have room for long lenses, so if you're using much more than the kit lens, it will be a tight fit. There is no built in strap on the bag, so if you don't have a strap on the camera, it will just be inconvenient. There's no room for any accessories, let alone an external flash. (I'm using a Canon Rebel T3i, for reference.)Ultimately, it is a rather flimsy case and it won't do much more than protect your camera from scratches. It will not protect the camera from any substantial bumps or knocks. And it's pretty pricy for what you get. Go for something more substantial."
1606,"Looks nine, feels nice and fits well. The iPad mini snaps right in and the case is very, very snug. The magnet turns it on and off correctly. The problem I found with it is that when you fold the cover over to make a stand, unlike the Apple Smart Cover, the magnet doesn't hold very securely so the stand slowly falls apart and the iPad slides down almost onto the surface it is resting on. Since, other than protecting the screen, that is the main function of the cover, I didn't rate it very high and ended up returning it to Company A."
1607,"A family member bought this for me as a gift after I put it on a wishlist and then bought one for themselves. I feel bad for leading them to do this for themselves because of the tiny remote.Unfortunately I learned that with optical audio output the TV remote will not control the volume (I used PC style speakers/woofer and headphone jack before, was easier to use than this). Then I discovered that there are NO buttons on the soundbar or woofer. So the remote is a requirement, as long as you can find it or you don't change the input type accidently. This remote is so small, it will slip into the tiniest crevices of your couch. If you have young kids that use your TV, this is going to be a problem. Oh, and the sound bar shuts off after a period of time not in use. So again, that tiny remote must be found.The sound and sleek size is actually good for the price, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a universal remote (Logitech Harmony) to control it with. I recommend finding a sound bar with actual buttons on the bar, that won't turn off if not in use (otherwise my Xbox One would control this just fine), and that has a slightly larger remote with better button layout (my 9 year old could have done better than this).To be fair, I've learned that Optical Audio output expects the volume to be controlled outside of the TV remote. So for any sound bar setup, you are going to be best off with a universal remote, so just make sure you factor that into your costs."
1608,"It had good quality, a good mic, and worked without any driver installations. It was a good product... but it broke in a matter of one month. On top of this, it was very unreliable! Sometimes the product would look WORSE than my PSEye camera, and sometimes it would display full HD, it all depended on the mood it was in I guess. I would have given this a solid 4 stars, but I can't recommend a product that malfunctions only a month out of the box..."
1609,The moment I got this cable it would not work unless I adjusted the cable just perfectly. Once I got it adjusted I can tell no difference between these and any other aux cables.Pros:Very good price and design based on the monster aux cable.Quality feel and thick cable makes it feel more sturdy.Cons:Did not work correctly without adjustment.
1610,"I travel a lot, with an iPad, an iPhone and other USB-powered devices, so a portable charger that has two outlets, one of which will supply the 2.1A for an iPad, is a good thing. Functionally, the iLuv RockWall charger serves that purpose, but it is much larger than it needs to be and is awkwardly designed so that it tends to block other outlets and is difficult to safely remove from an outlet.I've uploaded two photos comparing the iLuv charger to thePowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Chargerwhich I've had for about six months. Both have a 2.1A and .5A USB port, but the PowerGen is much smaller and doesn't block outlets the way the iLuv does. Removing the iLuv from an outlet is problematic - if you follow the instructions on the charger by grasping it above the buttons (that need to be pushed in to release the swivel), you're pulling at an angle and putting strain on the hinge and prongs. If you do the natural thing and grasp closer to the prongs, you put yourself at risk of shock.I don't know why iLuv makes a big deal about the interchangeable plug, since they provide only one and I see no offer to sell additional plugs. It doesn't help that the iLuv's price is much higher than the PowerGen's either.  I see that PowerGen now has a15W versionwith a swivel plug, if that's what you want. It is still smaller and cheaper than the iLuv. The iLuv says it is a 15W charger (the PowerGen I have claims to be 10W), yet the iLuv's power consumption rating is lower.Lastly, I want to gripe about the overpackaging of the iLuv. There are three plastic pieces inside the cardboard box, none of which are coded for recycling (two of them appear to be PET.) The package could have been half the size and still adequate."
1611,Idk if mine wasn't made well. The picture was fuzzy and I can't tolerate that. I read though some had really good picture. I returned this and got a samsung 32-inch. The samsung is good.
1612,This was a nice looking radio for a low price. I ordered 2 of them and a programing cable. Once they arrived neither of them would work with the cable and software. I found that the owners manual was not really user friendly so I went to th Internet for help trying to get them to work. I never did get them working but found out that there may be a problem with the programing cable fitting the radio jacks. I returned the radios the day after they arrived. I never did get them to work.
1613,"While battery life seems to be pretty good, the extra power capacity comes with a price. The form factor is not consistent with original battery. There is a bulge on the bottom of the battery (when properly inserted into the bay), that causes the the back of my HP DM4 laptop to be about an inch higher than the front. It also interferes with the lid so that now cant open my laptop lid fully.  Wasn't expecting this."
1614,"They look great and seem solid (as far as plastic goes) and fits well as it comes with multiple sized ear but gels which is why I gave it 3 stars.  For sound quality as skull candy ""boasts""... I don't hear it.  Sounds the same as the $10 pair I got from Kmart years ago.  The audible range is the same, the bass sounds about the same and the only one up this has is the microphone.  But honestly... I don't understand why these are worth $45 on Company A and almost $70 at Best Buy when they are clearly worth only about $20 at best.  You'd be better off saving a few more bucks and buying the $100 pair of Bose ear buds.Plus side is that it does come with a nice carry case.  But honestly that doesn't make the headphones any better.These are a great replacement for the cheap ones I broke... but I feel that I paid WAY too much for them and don't seem to perform any better than most other cheaper brands.  Your just paying for the name and nothing more.The SONY DR-EX12IP ear buds have everything this one has but costs $19.I would have been better off trusting my gut and going with Sony like I always have.------------UPDATE 2/25/2014--------------They almost lasted 4 months.  The right channel just crapped out on me.  I used them only at work sitting at a desk all day.  Save your money.  They felt cheap when I got them originally and now I know they are cheap as they didn't even last 4 months.  The left channel with the volume control and microphone still works but I don't really care anymore now that its only good for one ear.First and last time I will buy Skullcandy."
1615,"I've waited a couple of months to write this review, just to be fair and give myself time to learn the peculiarities of operating this brand and to get used to my new HD TV. I own 2 and use 1 Panasonic DVD recorder and have come to really like them. They've become extinct and I decided to extend their life by using them for recording TV programs only and view the recordings on a separate player Unfortunately the reviews for the newer Panny players are not so hot so I opted for this for it's upscaling, HDMI abilities.Right out of the box, the remote is too small. I have a slender build and my fingers are always hitting the next key. It's impossible to use in the dark also because the keys are too small and close together. The unit seems to respond very slowly to any of it's tasks except skip forward.The title menu only works when it wants to, which is annoying when I want to switch to the next program. The aspect ratio choices  don't come out as well on screen as my TV's choices so that's another minus. As someone else noted, some of the dvds skip (but work fine on my recorder) and the disc drawer opens 85% and thus discs get scratched, trying to load them. When it's working right the picture is great but because of all the drawbacks and annoyances I'm only giving it 2 stars."
1616,"Purchased this case after returning the flimsy Apple Smart Case and reading multiple raving reviews here on Company A... What a disappointment:- Carbon Fiber look seems attractive but actually feels very plastic and cheap and started peeling around the speaker cutout on day one. The pattern itself seems to be prone to damage as well and shows prints from objects placed on the case.- Laying the iPad flat requires flipping the cover around and the plastic flap sticking out makes for a wobbly tabletop position.- Last but not least, the case is heavy at close to 13oz adds over 50% weight to the 23oz iPad. It's just not worth ruining the beautiful engineering underneath for the utility of the aluminum stand (which works as advertised).Case is going back in the box. Will be looking at a less plastic-y alternatives."
1617,Its been less than 6 months and this product has lost its color and rubbery coating. Would suggest that you stay away from this poor quailty and built product
1618,"***First Week or So***Bought this mostly for cosmetics and to avoid clutter.  I needed five wired connections downstairs and didn't want to install a switch on top of the router, modem and other devices already cluttering my wall of devices.The first couple of days it worked great as the main router in my system.  The main interface is much cleaner, quicker, and responsive albeit less feature packed than the TP-Link Archer C7 that had been relegated to Access Point duty (fantastic AP, might I add).  Fewer lights on the front of this than most routers I've used but there's a ton on the back.  So if lights will keep you up at night, plan for some light blocking.I played around with the wireless on this device and it was pretty good, but I chose the Archer as the Access Point instead because of it's even better 2.4GHz coverage and the ability to throw wireless AC on the 5GHz band.***1 Month Later***The luster has worn off.There is just something wrong with WAN -> LAN.  I really wanted to keep this as my main router because the interface is so sharp and easy to use but it just can't hold my internet connection with any kind of reliability.  I have a 60/4mbps cable connection and a Motorola surfboard modem (DOCSIS 3.0).  When the MyNet900 is on the system, speeds will jump between &lt;1mbps to 62mbps from minute to minute.  Sometimes it will be great for an hour or so and just as frequently, no internet at all.  It seems to really struggle when trying to open multiple tabs on one browser with any client in the system.  The first tab will open fine, probably even the 2nd.  Anything more than that and you will probably be looking at ""Connecting..."" until they time out, eventually load or I usually just give up.  Pings between all of the devices are still there, and all LAN activity, like file transfers, is great.  Power Cycling the modem and router fix it temporarily or until I try to load multiple tabs or windows again.  Sometimes it works fine but there is just no earthly way to predict it.  At one point, I recabled everything with Cat6 and even swapped out the leased modem from my ISP and purchased a similar one from OfficeMax.  No difference. I have restored defaults till I was blue in the face.  I have messed with both the wired and wireless QOS settings.  I have even rearranged my DHCP reservations (from everything reserved to nothing reserved and a mix of Reserved and Dynamic) and the results are the same.  There was no difference whether it was the firmware that was shipped with the router or the update that I installed a week or so later.Yesterday, I went out and bought a new 8 port D-Link switch that was on sale for $40 and moved the modem to my TP-Link Archer C7 router that had been serving as the AP. Restored the DHCP and NAT on the TP-Link and hooked up the switch back downstairs where the MyNet and modem used to reside and haven't had a problem.  I suppose there's a chance that I got a bad unit, but really, the setup I have now is what I should have just done in the first place.I'm going to hang on to the unit.  It's been just more than 30 days, so I don't feel right returning it.  The proper thing to do would probably be giving WD a chance to warranty it but I don't want the cost or hassle of shipping things back and forth to find out that it is an issue with this router that can't be solved.  I'd probably end up with a refurb that has the exact same issue.  Luckily, the MyNet900 has a cool setting that allows you to just flip it from Router to Access Point mode.  When the weather gets better, I may bury some Cat6 in some conduit out to the Garage/Shed and set it up as an AP out there.  I'll bet it works great like that and really, $75 for an N900 AP with 8 ports on it is not a bad price.It could be a problem with handling high-speed DOCSIS 3.0 connections or an incompatibility with anything Motorola, but this router isn't high-speed, internet ready.  Also, Western Digital's brief flirtation with the consumer router market seems to be over.  It appears that WD has ceased production of all networking equipment.***Update***Kid you not, four hours after updating this review when I donwgraded it from 5 to 2 stars, I got a reply from WD Tech Support.  It was responding to an e-mail I had sent them about these exact issues almost 2 weeks ago.  Not only was it slow in being attended to, but they obviously hadn't read it since it instructed me to adjust the QOS settings in the router.  I had specifically told them I had already done that with no results.  Not impressed."
1619,"I was eager to receive what was among the highest-rated Android tablets to-date (early October 2012). Within a day of use, I was reminded of why I dumped my Galaxy phone a couple years ago for a Nexus. Manufacturers crippled the OS, and load the device up with apps they think you should have. Time after time, I would go to the app store and receive a message that the app is incompatible with my device. I even had to mess around just to install the Company A app store. Who knows when/if they will ever get around to upgrading to the current version of Android, and what additional incompatibility issues that will introduce.Perhaps I would have been more satisfied (or at least looked past the limitations of this expensive tablet) if I used the S Pen, which some indicate is a legitimate differentiator, but I did not. So, I dumped this on eBay for a $80 loss, and look forward to getting a ""pure Google"" tablet - Nexus. Lesson learned."
1620,"When I bought this board I had read reviews about the many people who were victim to the dual channel memory boot loop issue. Even then I decided to try my luck since this board does look awesome and has a lot of bang for the buck (assuming you're lucky and the bang does work). It turns out I was ""contemplated"" with a faulty board. I gave it two stars since it seems to work (and look) good but for the fact I cannot use my memory sticks in dual channel setups or I'll get a boot loop. After writing a review in another place an ASRock representative told me to send it to them for assistance but since I live in Brazil (I've bought it while in the US) it's not that easy for me. I didn't even know if they'd ship it to Brazil nor I wanted to not have a working PC for so much time (shipping, assistance and shipping back could take months).Even though I could've had a great experience it didn't happen in my case. Because I don't like to rely on luck I probably won't buy from ASRock again."
1621,"I've tried several visor mounted speakerphones and they've done a decent job. They also normally have a built in FM transmitter, so you can pair an iPad or phone with it and transmit tunes to an empty station on your car stereo. Lacking an FM transmitter, and being specifically designed for a vehicle is a serious flaw in this device. The sound quality is okay, it does function as a Bluetooth speakerphone, but at this price point Motorola and Jabra make better devices with more features. I can't really see any reason to buy this over a different device. On a golf cart this might be good, but then again, there are better options out there."
1622,"Product arrived in good condition but wasn't all that well made.  The back piece seemed brittle and cheap, and the front cover isn't as well-made as Apple's.  I returned it.  I imagine it works fine and I like that it covers the back as well as the front."
1623,"Wasn't as described.  Doesn't link well with Windows 8.  The software provided is not compatible with Windows 8 - shuts down the blue tooth (I have a very high end pc; have been in the IT business [hardware/software/web/presentations/etc.,] for over 30years and was quite taken aback when a supposedly new technology has so many connectivity issues"
1624,"Very thin film, which was hard to place on the screen. I had expected much better quality for this price."
1625,"I thought the quality was good and they were comfortable in the ear.  However, these have a very low volume level.  Not recommended for musict"
1626,"I bought the model with the Canon EF mount to use with my 5D Mark III body. The lens is tack sharp wide open and focuses quickly and quietly with the center AF point. Unfortunately, in my tests using a tripod and shutter delay, shots that are recorded as in focus on the camera using a peripheral AF point are soft throughout. After noting this I found other reviews and forum comments with this same complaint.Tamron evidently needs to update the firmware to communicate better with the 5D Mark III (and perhaps other bodies as well). If all I wanted was to use the center point this lens would be great, especially with stabilization, but that's not what I wanted and I returned the lens."
1627,i bought it as gift to protect the ipad air white....bought the black...months later.... the color of the case mix with the ipad (white)...kinda thumbs down for ruining the ipad color..
1628,"Im so frustrated by this GPS. I was so excited, the big screen, all these &#34;features&#34;. Well lets get it straight half the features it touts you have to pay extra for every year, the map updates and map update I love except it cant find destinations that my garmin easily could find. That in itself is infuriating! And im not talking some random middle of nowhere place im talking HUGE massive resorts etc big tourist destinations, national and state parks etc. This to me is a huge downfall and ridiculous. Then you have the multi point destination feature which is WHY I bought this in the first place I still cant figure it out. Then theres the sound. I cant hear the dam thing its not loud enough even at its loudest setting unless you have absolutely nothing else going on in the car. I listen to books etc and it isnt loud enough for me to understand it or hear it properly to get the correct route instructions. I tried hooking it into my cars bluetooth but that didnt work either. Just a real big disapointment."
1629,When I received this video camera I was disappointed in it.  The instruction sheet is not well written and I would not recommend buying this camera.  It has too many languages and a bit difficult to understand it.  This seller should have tested this camera before selling it.  The instructions should be rewritten to everyone to understand.  I do not recommend this camera recorder.
1630,"Well it works and that should be good enough, but is made with cheap plastic. It broke after first use. I ended up using crazy glue to put it back together."
1631,"First, I think this was a terribly designed product, but it does have use.  Let's talk about the good first.It can sync images over to your phone or tablet.  If you are out in the field, this can be a nice addition since most camera screens have a much lower resolution than an iPad.  It can also act as a remote shutter with live view and it can act as a remote preview.  That's basically it.Here's the bad...* No native app for iPad - You have to use the iphone app with a really low resolution.  WHY would you omit an iPad app?!?!* Not reliable for all phones - In several reviews, you'll read comments that it doesn't work with phone X or Y.  I had a hard time getting it to work with my Samsung Galaxy S3, however it did finally work.  It was just frustrating getting there.* Crashes and disconnects - This was what didn't work so well with my phone.  I was constantly seeing the phone disconnect from the camera.  The downloads would constantly fail.* Remote shutter with Live view without camera controls - When the live view comes on, if the camera is in manual mode and you haven't set it up yet, its very possible that you will just see a black screen.  I couldn't get it to work (no matter the setting) in a dark room.  I just saw a black screen on live view.  You can't change the settings in live view and the camera disables many settings while the dongle is plugged in (d7100) and connected, so it won't even allow you to change the settings on the camera (or I didn't figure it out).  The remote shutter is nearly useless.Overall, unless you are looking for a way to wirelessly download images to your phone or tablet from your dSLR, I wouldn't buy this accessory.  Even if you are looking for that capability, I would seriously consider the alternatives first.  In some cases, just getting the camera kit for phone/tablet is better."
1632,"I've purchased these headphones twice now and appreciate the noise limiting feature and sizing for my boy's (5 & 8). The sound quality isn't fantastic, but is certainly comparable to other models in this price class.There is one big problem with these cans though...the soft pads for the head are constantly coming off. I watched my son's use them to make sure they weren't pulling them off...and they weren't. Just the act of a child taking them off and putting them on can knock the soft ring away. Putting the rings back on isn't horribly difficult, but it does require a little dexterity and each time you do it you stretch the elastic a bit more which then causes them to come off quicker the next time.So, if you enjoy chasing around small colorful rings buy these headphones.My suggestion to the company would be to design some sort of retaining clip to hold the pads more tightly to the plastic."
1633,"So i got this battery a few days ago. I charged it 24 hours before use. Only to say its at 90%. The battery drained real fast like the old one that i replaced. The original Hp battery only started to due that after three years of use. This one is doing it fresh off receiving it. I don't know if its because its used or because its cheap mark off. Either way, i am disappointed and feeling ripped off. I continued to use it for few days before leaving a review to make sure i covered all bases. No matter long i charge it, it goes no higher than 85-90% charge and then its down to under 40% in less than 20 minutes.Keep in mind also that this is being shipped from Asia. I thought the shipping was slow but now i realize that was the least of my concern/problems. Do your self a favor and learn from my mistakes. Buy original from Hp and spend the extra cash. I know i will next time."
1634,"I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I'm mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn't have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that's when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I'd rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one."
1635,"The Zoo-Tunes Portable Mini Character Speakers is a cute looking speaker system for use with ipods, ipads, iphones, etc. that nicely masks the fact that it is a speaker, but doesn't provide really great sound.  Also, the cord plug your device into the speaker is very short and it doesn't stay locked in very well when you wrap it up to put away."
1636,"i puchased this item from a big office supply store beginning with the letter s. i am taking it back. i only had it for 19 days and so far i went through 3 sets of AAA batteries and i only use it sparingly. it seems to go into standby and reconnect when i need it to, but today when i tried to use it, it wouldn't turn on or connect to my mac unless i put new batteries in. im taking it back to the store today. Company A's description indicates that this item contains internal rechargeable batteries. but mine did not"
1637,"I bought this device because I read so many reviews comparing it to the apple mouse, some even saying it was better. Combined with the high overall rating and the lower price, I determined I could deal with the quirks. If I had written this review a week after I had gotten it, perhaps I would have shared in their enthusiasm of the reviews I had read. The reality however, is this mouse is a bit temperamental. I typically use it off and on for about 6-8 hours a day, as I use my laptop for both personal and work use. I read how it took a few extra seconds to ""wake up"" after non-use, and actually got used to that pretty quickly. Unfortunately, the mouse now will disconnect even as I am using it to move the pointer across the screen, and I will have to stop and wait for it to reconnect. I've had it for about a month now, and I've already started on my 3rd set of batteries. I wonder, what's the point of this unit disconnecting so much if I am going to have to change the batteries so often? Perhaps I just got a lemon. Whatever the case, I find myself now regressing to the built-in track pad, and leaving the mouse abandoned to the side of my desk. After having some real time using it, I can't say I'd buy it again. If you expect some stability from your equipment, I'd try another brand."
1638,"Sadly, I was only ever able to use one out of the 3 covers provided. In one, the holes that were supposed to be open for the camera on the front of the tablet, wasn't. They wouldn't come out at all. A second one had actual rough spots on the plastic, almost like fine grains of sand that wouldn't come off. I couldn't place it aganst the screen of the tablet and I couldn't have it facing up or swiping the screen was impossible. Finally, the third one had the holes punched out and was clean enough to use. Sadly this is a high price to pay just for one screen protector."
1639,"Installation was simple.  It wasn't recognized by Windows 7 64-bit, but I downloaded the latest drivers (version 11224) from the SilverStone site and the card worked perfectly.Well... perfectly until the machine tried to go to sleep when I left it unattended.  The next morning I got up and for the first time in over a year of running the machine, it has a BSOD (blue screen).After experimenting around, I found that the computer only does this if there is a USB3 device attached to one of the ports when the machine tries to go to sleep.  If nothing is attached when it tries to sleep... everything is perfect.I can't give it a 1 because it works great when the machine is running.  But I can't give it more than a 2 since my machine can't sleep with something attached to the card."
1640,"For whatever reason, this headset doesn't pick up my voice barely at all.  I have every windows mic setting set to max, and my applications that accept voice input are also set at 200% input (the max). The result is that people can barely hear me, even with the mic practically inside my mouth.Plus, the double cord from each earphone tangles up constantly and makes putting the headset on/off much more of a pain than the type with a single cord threaded through the headband to earpiece #2.  The arch of the headset is hard and uncomfortable against the top of the head (the edges are sharp; who designed that??), so I have to wear it around my neck instead, making the mic boom awkward to place comfortably.  The mic boom has 90 degrees of rotation from the attachment point, which is OK, but it's stiff, so you can't really adjust it much.The earphone covers feel flimsy and cheap (like $5.00 headphones).  I don't think you'd be wearing this on your ears for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling the hard plastic underneath."
1641,"Although this is a nice case, it didn't work for me.  The tablet snaps into it and is almost impossible to take out.  I panicked when I couldn't take my tablet out of it and I felt it was just not worth it.  Also, rather than a magnetic closure there is an elastic strap that keeps the case closed.  I would rather have a sleep/wake magnetic closure.  It is a nice leather case with a 3 year warrantee, but for my own preference it just didn't work.  Live and learn!"
1642,I owned this device for well over a year before I could use it due to compatibility issues. I had purchased several cables trying to get this to connect to my Mac for sometime and even invested in the alternate docking bay which was supposed to make it compatible with other versions of the OS. Nope. Wouldn't connect. Nothing but problems.Later when I hooked it up to a new machine &#8230; nothing. The thing was a ghost from jump and I never realized it. Now it's a huge black paperweight that performed poorly OOTB.
1643,It fits the tablat well. It is not quite sturdy enough. Will not recommend it to others. Need some improvement with the stand.
1644,I have this tablet and i find this tablet works best with an otter box defender case i have one and i totally happy with the way you can use it all ports are accessable and the pen is not covered over thought went into this product and it protects your investment and it has a built in screen protector and tablet stand I paid $83.00 from otter box its worth it..
1645,"If you think you can use this with a note app to take notes on your iPad, forget it. If you want something a 3 year old can use to make doodles on your iPad using the note app, go ahead and buy it. It's worse than trying to sign your name at the grocery with a stylus on the card swiping machine. Fine tip? I guess that depends on what you consider &#34;fine&#34; to be, for me this is not it. Back to pencil or pen and paper. Pretty much a waste of money."
1646,"I was expecting to love this, it is just what I need for traveling.  But the 12-volt plug failed after a few months, leaving me with just another plug-in charger.  It did still have the advantage of a plug built-in to the back of the charger - the Olympus ones have a cumbersome AC cord.I also felt the batteries did not hold a charge as well as Olympus-brand batteries, though I did not do any careful testing. The fact that the Wasabi batteries can ONLY be charged in the Wasabi charger is a big negative.I still need a 12-volt charger for Olympus batteries, and one that doesn't need an AC cord, but want higher quality."
1647,"The case is ascetically pleasing.  It smells good, it looks good, but falls short in performance.The case is awkward to use in landscape mode in comparison to other iPad cases.  This case has two ways to prop up the iPad case in landscape mode - both are awkward.  The zipper is poor quality and on my first night of use it didn't catch the teeth properly and took a bit of work to get it to sit right to zip up.In any case for $80 I expect perfection in concept and use.I will be returning this ASAP and going back to my old case.Two stars for cool factor!"
1648,I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.  This product just did not work well. the music did not go through consistently well to the computer and I abandoned the whole idea after trying to convert 1 cassette.Don't waste your money
1649,"This is a  ""replacement cable"" for bose....REPLACEMENT! not an actual bose product and the sound quality is lost when using these. I would highly recommend buying a better quality cable...or ....spend three bucks on a replacement. They will be the same quality as these. These do work but they are also low quality and should sell for a lot less. good luck :)"
1650,"Very easy to apply and it looks great.The problem is that after a month the clear part has blemishes or &#34;dings&#34; or whatever you want to call it, but the end result is that it makes the back of my iPad look tacky....Real pitty as it does look nice when new."
1651,"I will probably be returning this router.  It does not support filtering external IP addresses nor does it support regular firewall rules (i.e., blocking programs with certain file extensions), which to me is one of the most basic requirements of any router.  I didn't even know I needed this ability until recently, and I'm dumbfounded it is not a standard feature set.  The only thing you can do is block access to hostnames by keyword or domain name, but not by IP address alone.  You can only block IP addresses of devices connected to your own LAN.On the plus side, this router was a good price and came with a $20 rebate, which is the main reason I bought it.  Set up was quick and easy.  It's probably fine for the most basic user but that's it."
1652,"I loose service from this device once in a while, and for consistency ended up just syncing to the main wifi - even though it's the weaker signal in the vicinity.  The device is otherwise well designed - it is easy to set up, and is aesthetically well made."
1653,"This product was bought  to serve as a range extender. While it was extremely easy to set up, it did not extend the range of my wireless signal within the house. A side by side comparison of signal strength consistently showed the main router and Almond at the same signal strength or weakness depending on my location. This was tested on  2 mobile devices as well as a laptop computer.I really wanted to like this. The design was great and I love the touchscreen interface. But for 79 bucks it is not doing what I purchased it for, so I will be returning it"
1654,"I have this case and a Speck case for two 13&#34; MBPs. I've had the Speck case for several years now, and no damage has occurred to it (or the MBP). Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the EC Technology case.The two computers are stored in the same area, exposed to the same children, and basically get the same wear and usage, but the corner just under my right wrist somehow cracked and broke off. The machine hasn't been dropped, and I see no damage underneath, so I can only assume the EC case just, well, broke.Bummer. I'll be replacing it with a Speck case as soon as possible."
1655,"I thought this product would allow me to take a portable hot spot wherever I went and connect to WiFi in public places.  This is something I have needed for a long time, because I often have to take my laptop with me to appointments to get work done, and I need Internet access for that.  However, that's not what this does.  You can't just whip this out of your bag, turn it on, and have access. You have to plug this into a router to get the access.  This basically does me no good at all, because I'm pretty sure that no one at my doctor's office or in some other public building will let me plug my device into their router.  This is probably just a misunderstanding on my part, but I wanted to mention it in case anyone else had the same idea about this product."
1656,"This is an expensive toy but I thought it would be nice for travel and play and I wanted to be able to display the screen of my T-Mobile Note2 and T-Mobile 10.1 Samsung Tablet on my home theater system.At first I couldn't get it to work to save my life, then I discovered that you really have to jam the HDMI cable into the unit to get it seated all the way. If you can connect to the device but then it drops the connection, check this on your unit because that was the error I was getting until I seated the cable all the way in.Once I had that fixed, it connects with my Note2 quickly and easily.My 10.1 tablet was not so easy. The option in the menu (despite being loaded up to the latest updates) is simply not on my tablet and when I try and download the cast software to my tablet from the play store it tells me ""Not compatible with this device."" Many hours of playing with it online have led me to the conclusion that not all Samsung 10.1 tablets are the same and Samsung gets a zero in my book for that trick.As half of the intended utility of the device is now shot and it is an expensive one-trick pony of a toy I may yet return it. But it works as advertised on my Note2.There is some lag so I would expect that it is not good for games.Updated: 6/18/14. This product has gotten worse over time so I lowered it to 2 stars. I rarely use it now and there are much better options to do the same thing now."
1657,"I had a real simple plan... Install USB 3.0 connectivity in my MacPro tower. Seemed simple enough, anyway. Turns out that ""Generic"" cards like the Syba don't work because they don't have any drivers available for Mac. I heard that generic cards with certain chipsets (NEC) would work with older generic Mac drivers out there (LaCie, others), so I went ahead with purchase of this card, plus I needed a card that accepts internal power which the Syba does (and has a Molex connector for).Unfortunately generic cards can contain varied brands of chipsets, like Renasas, NEC, VLI, etc.. Newer Mac OS X flavors like the one in my machine now (OS X 10.8) have eliminated some older cards from being installable. I tried several. Now, because of these issues, I'm forced to give up on generics like this Syba card, which is really supplied with only a Windows Driver for it.The model number of the card driver, in case you want to check it out for yourself, is a VL80X. Bottom line, technical details weren't provided in the information by Company A, though they were in the instructions of where to download updates (at the very back). Returning this product due to its unavailable drivers for Mac OS X (or any Mac Drivers!).Plan B (or is that C?). Will instead retry one of the two possible choices that do offer specific drivers designed for and supposedly compatible with OS X 10.8, Sonnet and CalDigit. I considered, as other users have, modifying drivers provided, but unfortunately I'm not trained to do that and don't want the card to quit on me or ruin my OS installation or other peripherals down the road. My rating of this card is 50% build quality, 25% provided info, 25% manufacturer accessories provided.CalDigit's card (BG U3 Host Adapter) however is a 'no go' because it's out of stock, probably will be for a long time. Their newer dual USB 3.0 & SATA combination card doesn't support USB power, needed by my card reader. While it might work for externally powered USB HD cabinets with separate power supplies, that is not my application. The Syba, Startech and Sonnet cards at least have external power available. Note that the power will only be applied if the driver is active. Without a working driver, the entire card doesn't work, even though the Syba is recognized by my system (shows up in System Report as driver not installed).My original problem with the Sonnet (first of three cards tried) was that it caused interference to the internal Bluetooth card picked up via the internal BT antenna. I have since learned about this issue, wired for and mounted an external BT antenna which I hope will fix that while improving performance of the internal BT. Finding the external power to run to the card was an issue which was solved easily enough by running an internal power extension cable to the card from the unused second CD/DVD drive connector. So, besides the card itself, the project cost is the extension cable, the external antenna and the time to put it all into the computer. Luckily, adding these extra parts proved easy once the research was done in the MacPro!Sonnet will be the 'charm', I now think/hope. Anyway it's the only alternative left... Don't like going backwards. Thankfully, Company A has let me try the different boards and return those that didn't work. Kudis for that. Really though, they also bear fault for not providing the driver and compatibility information in the first place, so beware, save yourself time and agony, do the reearch.  And if you have a similar application don't go cheap only to find these issues.Good luck!"
1658,"I was given these as a gift.  Although I know Beats has a very mixed reputation for sound quality, I think they sound fine.  HOWEVER they are tight to the point of pain.  I've tried everything I can think of, I don't believe I have a particularly large noggin, but it's like putting my head into vice. (Think about the torture scene in Casino and you'll get the idea.)  I've owned them for two years and I've probably worn them a total of four hours.To be clear, I've been wearing headphones for work for ten years.  My go-to pair are Bose Quiet Comfort (I'm no audiophile) and I have no trouble wearing those for five, six hours at a stretch."
1659,Wanted to connect this to my TV and stream audio to a small wireless speaker. No luck. Lesson learned. I give!
1660,"I generally am pleased with this machine but it has one serious flaw that cannot be made to go away:The touch pad is way too large in it's horizontal dimension.The result of this is that it's too easy for ones palms to inadvertently touch the pad while typing.  The result of unintended contact is often complete erasure of entire swaths of composed text from an entry window, wiping out minutes of effort.After many months of ownership I still cannot train myself to type with my palms not resting on the computer..  so I'm constantly losing work.  The only way out of this short of amputating both my thumbs is to type all text into a keystroke saving edit buffer so that I can recover what I've inadvertently destroyed (and that's a whole lot of hassle) then transfer the contents to the target browsers text window..  I've typed this feedback forcing myself keeping my palms off the computer so as not to lose it all.  It's too much work to remind myself to do that all the time..  esp. when no other laptop that I've ever had has this characteristic !"
1661,"It did not work.  When I plugged into my tablet, it had a charging symbol with a circle & red line through it.  Thought it was my tablet and I tested my husband's charger, which worked just fine, so I knew it was the cable.  No problems returning it though.  They couldn't have been nicer.  Too bad it didn't work."
1662,"The unit I received would NOT automatically back up my data.  It would back up my data only if I dragged and dropped the data to it, but would not function as an autiomatic unit.  When I attempted to contact Toshiba I discovered that they do not have an email address.  You may only contact them by telephone.  I am 84 years old and my particular hearing problem will not allow me to communicate by telephone.  Surely this is some form of discrimination against people who cannot communicate by telephone.  I had always respected the Toshiba name and its products, but now , , not so much."
1663,I own several Bluetooth speakers and am always looking for better ones. I love my JBL micro wireless and was going to buy another when i read about this speaker. Cnet even said this was better. There is no comparison. The JBL is much better with real bass and better sound. This speaker hardly produced any bass. Also the black speaker is khaki in color. The shape of the JBL fits better in your pocket. The speaker if this one is also exposed so it could get damaged much more easily.
1664,"In fact, it didn't really live at all. Bought it in December as a family gift for our living room TV as we've cut the cord (no more cable TV) and cannot get OTA programming, even with antennas.The Roku LT started acting up in April but would reset if we unplugged it for a minute or so before plugging it back in. Here it is June, and now even that doesn't work. The players only have a ninety day warranty, so I'm out the money for it and no repair recourse except out of my own pocket, apparently.My first gen Roku is still going strong (passed on to a family friend) as is my Roku HD. If I get another Roku, it won't be the LT unless I get an extended warranty, I'll tell you that. A real shame, because the price is right."
1665,"We don't have an internet ready TV and don't want to watch on our computer or hook up our computer to the TV.  This is perfect.  We watch quite a bit of Netflix and since we have an Company A prime account we get lots of movies with that.6/10/13 UPDATE - Well... it was good while it lasted. I had to change my rating.  We've had it 6 months and it now blinks on and off.  The warranty is only 90 days.  So, I will buy another one, but this time I will buy the 2 year warranty for $4.98."
1666,"I spent months looking into replacing my Dropbox account with an NAS. Synology came up as a likely candidate. Their site makes it ""seem"" very user friendly, and filled with possibilities, from syncing all your files across computers, to mobile devices, and with instant access to all your files from any computer through the internet. A perfect replacement for dropbox, and with even more possibilities, hosting your own email, calendar, contacts, etc... Sounds great!Turns out, it's not that simple to set up at all. If you are a layperson when it comes to network stuff, good luck. It might be worth the trouble, except after you set up all your accounts, software, and transfer your files to your NAS and you decide to make the DiskStation accessible through the internet (which is absolutely essential to sync between computers and make your files accessible through the internet or via mobile phone, or to set up email, calendar etc), it has no support for routers provided by such companies as Verizon Fios. Not exactly an obscure company. Synology's solution? Go buy a router on their recommended list. Or you can do the setup manually. I did, but although I could access the disk station remotely by using the IP, I could not use the address setup through the synology site. As far as I could understand it, the access was directly to the Disk Station, not the Cloud Station; in any event, not the interface I was hoping for. Access from your home network is easy, it's setting up internet access that gets more difficult: if you want to be able to access your files from anywhere, even from public computers. Same thing if you want to host your own email, calendar, etc. If I simply wanted a home network setup, there are far cheaper/easier solutions out there, but far fewer that provide remote access.In short, unless you are extremely savvy when it comes to networking, are willing to purchase a new router as well and/or have hours and days (weeks?) to dedicate to informing yourself and setting it up, all I can say is: good luck. I'm no specialist, but I generally have no problems setting up my home networks etc.I gave this 2 stars, because the software (DiskStation Manager) is the same across all Synology NASs and is advertised even for home use; and yet it is far too complicated to get full functionality from this product if you don't have tremendous knowledge in networking, which the vast majority of home users do not have. What a huge waste of money (return shipping), time and effort. Very, very disappointed by this purchase, because I wanted to love it so much. If Synology made a truly easy user interface for home users, this product might have tremendous potential with average consumers these days."
1667,I bought 2 of these speakers afrer reading reviews and recommendations from other Company A customers on other speakers. I was dissapointed when I received them. The sound is no better than my Samsung tablet speakers. The cord is so short that the speaker is useless with a tablet without an extension cable.
1668,There is no reason that this product should have stopped working after on 3 months of light use. I am very disappointed. The tablet will no longer charge. I have tried the AC adapter which has been charging it up until now and I have tried several different USB connectors and it will not charge with any of them. The seller only has a 30 return policy so I have contacted the companies that they the seller recommended to see it they will honor the manufacturer warranty. I hope I don't get the run around and they will promptly send a replacement.
1669,"I thought I might buy one of these units because of the favorable reviews, in here, and the low price, $99, I found at Office Max. The thing was, this tablet was set up beside higher-priced ones including a Galaxy priced at $329.  Let me tell you, I literally compared them, side by side, and there wasn't any competition:  The Galaxy did things so much better, so much faster, so much clearer.  I wanted to compare video quality, so I loaded the identical You Tube video at the exact same time.  The video was loaded and played on the Galaxy before this unit even had it loaded.  At that, it took another two minutes to get to the point where the video could be played when clicked on.  I ran the test three times with identical results each time.  The quality of the video was three times clearer on the Galaxy.  This unit's video was blurred, by comparison.Yeah, I know, you get what you pay for, and my $99 stayed in my wallet because I would not, in any way, want to throw it away on a tablet that was third-rate, at best.  I may wait for the Galaxy to come down, a bit, or I may find a tablet from another company that will, at least, provide competent performance.  This unit cannot do that, as I see it."
1670,Returned it after demoing it at home for a few days.  Sound quality is not what I expected for that price. It's a beautiful piece of hardware but the sound is lacking especially after that speaker was designed by Pioneer's speaker wunderkind (and bears his signature).
1671,"If you search for reviews on this deck you'll find most of my objections. I didn't listen and bought it anyway, mainly because my first choice was out of stock and I wanted it right now. The menu system is way too complicated. I had to have a neighbor show me how to make the back speakers work instead of the default which tried to treat them as a subwoofer. The faceplate is absolutely unreadable in bright light no matter how you set it. I finally bought an amplifier just so I could use the RCA jacks to hook up my speakers instead of the nightmare chore of trying to solder or butt connect the infinitesimally small wires coming out of this deck. Each wire is about like two human hairs and if you're not very, very careful when you strip the insulation off, you'll wind up with no wire. The radio reception is not as good as the 8 year old Alpine I have in my boat. I even bought a power amplified antenna to help with reception and that did make a difference.  All in all, I don't recommend this deck."
1672,i've seen better...the tip is not as sensitive to the tablet screen so there's a tendency for me to push harder on the screen.
1673,"This is my first wireless mouse.  I gave it two stars because the actual wireless part works well, and I've had zero issues. The size and weight also seems good. Now the negatives.  In short, its unpredictable.  The touch surface is absolutely horrible at figuring out what you intend to do, be it right click, left click, or scroll.  I shut off the swipe gestures in the software to try to stabalize the mouse some, and it helped, but then what is the point?  Left clicks can often cause a right click, right clicks cause left clicks, and the simple act of grabbing the mouse to move it can cause the screen to scroll uncontrollably.  This mouse tries to do too many things and the end result is it doesnt do any of them very well.  I really miss my old mouse right now with the two buttons and a scroll wheel.  Its a nice looking mouse but asthetics rank pretty low on my scale; it needs to work, and it just doesnt."
1674,"The plug that plugs into the Kindle HD does not fit. recommend you find something else that would work, thanks"
1675,"I am not sure why they did with the key ring what they do. The outer case of the drive is metal, looks great and feels sturdy.But that these people made the keyring attachment out of plastic is a joke. It will break, i will lose it sooner or later.I mean, come on, this is a world brand, and they do make high quality stuff (mostly)Data reading and riding speeds weren't that important to me, I did not check that, For me the handiness factor was most important.But all the handiness doesnt matter if i lose the data and the stick.....Bad idea guysIf you have questions please dont hesitate to ask, i will always try to answer"
1676,It picks up any little piece of lint from the hands.  I didn't like it at all.  don't bother spending the money.
1677,"I guess I'm spoiled. I love using my iPhone, the touch screen is amazing. I got this meter to use with my pocket wizards and thought the concept was spot on! Well, I am disappointed in the quality of the touch screen, it's like the old cell phones or the old windows pocket planners. The screen was not sensitive, took too long to adjust and when it would shut off it took several seconds to start up and then adjust the flash output. Not happy with it, maybe the second version, when it comes out will be better."
1678,"Because Samsung has no shame and no imagination they made this look exactly like a MacBook Air.  But you are not getting Mac build quality, service, and support.  It's a cheap feeling laptop and the screen is washed out with poor contrast compared to an Air.  Plus you are still running Windows which is mediocre and outdated compared to OS X.  So if cheap is your thing and you want people to think you have a MacBook Air I guess this one way to go."
1679,"Received the packaged that came from china last week of december, for two weeks of usage of the product the earbuds got crack and the plastic hooks are broken and lose.the box container are all busted already"
1680,I bought it because it is from company LG. The performance was bad and Hence I returned the product already
1681,"I have had other Asus laptops and they are good.  But I am not impressed with this particular model.  The shape is awkward, it is not necessary to make it that big, it is a15.6 inch, but the whole size is bigger than a 17 inch laptop, the keys are not very responsive, the hard drive is a cheap brand and very slow,  The 24GB SSD can only function as a hibernate re-start, but any Windows 8 hibernate re-start is fast, you don't need a SSD.  I have to replace the 500GB hard drive with a real SSD to make the laptop fast.  The motherboard cannot fully utilize the 8GB RAM memory.  It shows 7.78GB.  The DVDRW drive is poorly made and has a cheap look, and because it is an ultrabook, there is no ""clearance"" underneath the DVD ROM, whenever you open or close the ROM it will hit the desk surface.  The resolution is poor.  I cannot find all the drivers or software for Windows 8 on Asus website.  Some of the software will not install on Windows 8 although there is an operating system choice on Asus website for you to choose from.  I am sorry I am not impressed by this model and I don't have lots of positive things to say here."
1682,"if you can fix your own computer or have few dollars to spare for serving fee then go ahead purchase this desk top. it is fast, huge memory, wireless works great. UNTIL something goes wrong! if you call gateway under manufacturers warranty. First, you will be dealing with third world nationals, be prepared for it. Communication is horrible. Second, they are like a parrot! They will keep repeating you what is in the text in front of them, not listening the word you are telling them. Once, you pass that they want you to secure all your data on your PC, because their initial, knee jerk reaction to anything wiping off your hard drive and re-loading it back base on factory standards. Like I said no listening, when I told them DVD player is NOT powering up. it is a physical problem, not a software issue. Reply: Our standard procedure, we will wipe hard drive and re-load factory base level. Again, be warned before buying this PC. Can you fix it yourself? or have enough funds to get it fixed? DO NOT COUNT ON WARRANTY. Oh! by the way, you WILL pay for shipping too! Good luck."
1683,"Reasonable case but disappointed because: a) does not hold angled table top position in &#34;portrait&#34; mode - topples as too top-heavy, and b) not very durable -started falling apart after a few months. In all fairness, this is to be expected at this price range, and I was ready to replace."
1684,"Although the product page lists this as a bluecell carabiner, this is in fact a product made by Caden and it just happens to include a bluecell velcro strip.Also, don't purchase this if you are expecting more than one of the carabiner parts.  The way it seems this was intended to be used is as seen in this flickr album: [...]Additionally, here are some rough measurements, since the product page didn't provide any:The diameter of the metal is 1/2 cm or 1/5 in.From the bottom of the clasp to the top of the carabiner measures 6 cm or 2 3/8 in.From top to bottom of the carabiner (interior) measures 3.2 cm or 1 1/4 in.The width of the carabiner (interior) measures 1.5 cm or 9/16 in at its widest.The rectangular clasp measures 2.75 cm or 1 1/16 in wide.The rectangular clasp measures 1 cm or 3/8 in across.Review of the carabiner.The carabiner seems pretty sturdy.  The spinner is pretty loose but it doesn't seem like it is in risk of falling out.  The latch of the carabiner seems ok, however it uses the sort of spring that I associate with low build quality and I've observed is prone to falling out.  I suppose the spring mechanism on the gate isn't too big of a deal since it has the screw lock to keep it in place.  Overall, I think the build quality is pretty good. The issue I have with this is false advertising."
1685,First thing my wife said when I put these on... I CAN HEAR THE MUSIC.  I'm not sure what I expected but thought the bone conduction technology wouldn't make you have to crank it up loud enough that others will hear it.  It's already annoying enough to be riding in the subway and hear others music with closed ear headphones - I'm not going to be one of those people! Sound quality was just ok and for the price - there are better options.  I like not blowing your ears out with in ear phones - but this isn't the answer.
1686,"Although this item was refurbished, I trusted its quality because it was a Samsung product and the price was right.  Before its purchase, the description did not caveat missing parts if refurbished.  When I received the recorder, the adaptor (for charging) was missing and two other parts as illustrated in Owner's Manual.  In the future, I will order this type of item, new."
1687,"Its ok. My phone doesnt charge fast like in 45 min, this takes like 4 hours. I wouldnt buy it."
1688,"I bought this SS because I thought I was a great idea to watch HULU, Company A Instant and HBO go. Well, first of all, it is slow, the default interface is faulty. I run it at 720p. There is no Company A Instant app for android, flash video is not available on this device. Hulu is not friendly with the remote, lucky for me I had a $10 IR wireless keyboard with trackball that I use with this, to make the story short, I just received my new Roku 3 to replace this item. I plan to use this item with PlayOn, if it does not work, I would just plug-in a spare computer to my spare TV.By the way, WiFi is a joke, all my other devices get great connection even farther then where my TV is, but this does not get a good reception there. I switch it to a TV closer to my router about 10 mts and the connection works well, but the hardware is not enought for the demanding apps.Recomendation: Look for a quad core, 2GB RAM stick with integrated bluetooth to have a good stick, or just buy Roku 3."
1689,"It's no wonder they give three of these to you in the package.  The first one is pretty much a throw-away, while you try your best to get it placed just right and you miss a few pieces of dust so some of the bubbles just won't come out no matter what.  I managed to get the second one on with just a couple of little bubbles near the edges that I could live with.While this screen protector does a great job cutting glare, and keeping the fingerprints from being as noticeable, it degraded the HD+ display so much I jokingly called it an LD (low definition) display.  That was the deal-breaker for me.  I gave my eyes a couple weeks to try and adjust, but the lack of clarity convinced me it had to go back.Meanwhile, I use the ArmorSuit Military Shield on my Galaxy S3, so I'm going to give that a try for my HD+ and hope for the best."
1690,"At 250 bucks, one can get a much better laptop. This chrome book is for some one who only watch Youtube and read and send emails, it can do nothing else. Video quality is very poor, HDMI only work for a few old Tv's sets. Mine will be returned quickly, I have no time to waste for this junk."
1691,This little speaker sounds good when its working.It would turn off and on by itself after it was turned on.Also after it would go back on it would play the music on the SD card at a faster speed.Maybe I got a lemon.I sent it back to Company A with no problem.
1692,"I knew buying this was a risk.  This item is listed multiple times on Company A and the other reviews aren't very good.  I suspect most of these reviews are fake or there is just a huge variation in quality.There is a constant buzzing background noise when using these.  We've tried it on two different computers which different cables.I would recommend biting the bullet and getting a more expensive name brand if you need external 5.1 sound.  As is often the case, you get what you pay for."
1693,When I first put this on the little dust removal tape seemed to be extremely useful at cleaning the screen however once I put the film on there was still dust everywhere so my first one was wasted. The second one I got on with more success and only 1 dust bubble but it was livable and I enjoyed how bright and shiny it made the screen look everything just popped! Then the 2nd day I had this on it began to lift at the bottom near the button and now I have little dust bubble appearing at the bottom and working their way up the screen. Not very impressed but I don't want to use my last one in case something major happens and I need another screen protector in the future. Also the stylus leaves marks on this thing. I would say this is a just ok kinda product.UPDATED INFO!!! I have now gone through all 3 in this set and it gets worse and worse. Now on my final application I have major specks and bubbles and the sides are lifting away from the phone. If I could get my money back I would.
1694,This strap is a great concept. But i don't like it. I bought the carry speed strap and it is way better.
1695,"I do like this; it looks nice, feels sturdy etc. But I am a little disappointed because of the lack of capabilities (charging only), and also as the contacts don't always work (after a few months only half the time; cleaned them and everything)."
1696,"I received 2 mini full body kits but so far I tested one of them.Here is my experience -1. The screen cover doesn't seem to fit well (comparing to the regular iPad screen I also ordered).The cover is too short, both top and bottom, and the cut out of Home button can't be centered when I try to accommodate the front camera hole.2. The back of the cover doesn't have cutout for the SIM card slot for my LTE model.3. Installation solution is not enough for the 'full body' cover. While one bottle of solution is fine for installing cover, I need second bottle to be sufficient for both front and back cover.I will report it to the customer care at (888) 225-0471 soon."
1697,"That's right! So that's first and foremost... * not designed for the ipad4. * Meaning, it has one too many die-cut button shapes than are actually on the device. ALso the dimension is an exact fit... to exact in fact. If you protect the rear side with a hard backing it will peel up the edges of this skin of the screen protector sheet, which has too much glare for my liking. Also, I barely had enough solution to get the job done. I'm trying the military shield screen protector now sine Skinomi was kind enough to send me a free replacement, I can try both and go back to Skinomi if necessary... but it's doubtful."
1698,"PROS: Quiet, cool, autoadjusts to temps, thermal paste already appliedCONS: Though the unit is very quiet and works well, the reason I gave it 2 stars is as follows:- the back plate was cut completely wrong. The tubes that stick through the mobo to screw in the bolts are WAY too long. The plastic tubing is so long that the screws will never provide a tight fit. Any beginner will have destroyed their computer if they actually believed that having the plate so loose was OK. LUCKILY, I had the back plate from the old H80 which was the CORRECT fit. The plate that came with this unit was totally wrong.Another issue is the plastic cover on the heatsink unit with the thermal paste already added. It is a very poor fit. when I took the unit out of the plastic sheeting, the cover for the heatsink fell off and caused the thermal paste to smear off in places. Luckily again, I had antec thermal paste that I bought so I could reapply the paste to the heatsink.Third and also extremely important - fitting on the heatsink to the CPU: To say that the squeeze is a tight fit is quite an understatement. The tubing is so stiff that you have to apply a ton of pressure on the heatsink onto the CPU otherwise you run into the serious issue of the heatsink sliding on the CPU and smearing the thermal paste. Normally with heatsinks you screw in opposite sides (diagonally) so that the heatsink sits evenly. Trying to do this was very very difficult and required a TON of pressure - so much so that I was afraid I would crack my brand new motherboard. The length of the double sided screw is the same on each side. And when you add the top plate to hold the heatsink down, you have very little room to screw in the heatsink.ALL of these issues could have been EASILY fixed if Corsair had a useful quality control division. None of these issues existed on the H80.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I had the original Corsair H80 but wanted to upgrade to this one after hearing that this one is better.

1699,"The ads are not real clear (IMHO) that this is a charging ONLY cable.Admittedly, I'm hating on Mediabridge because they aren't consistent with their customer support.  I bought a data cable from them exactly like this one except different color connectors that died after two weeks.At first, they responded to my negative review with an offer to give me a new cable, but when it came time to actually get the new cable, they denied my RMA because I couldn't return the defective cable.Whats the point in returning a defective cable?  It'll cost me the same amount as buying a new cable just to ship it back!  Anyway, I'd thrown the defective cable away so I couldn't return it.  Therefore, Mediabridge refused to replace the defective cable.I need to get 5 more cables, but it won't be from Mediabridge!"
1700,"find it difficult to use on surface pro, in the end given up and just use the sleeve case that would fit the pro and touch cover"
1701,"Definitely a used item! The cases had scratches on the INSIDE of the screen protectors. Lame. I needed them the next day so I'm stuck with them. They do not fit the iPads very well, they do not click all the way shut. All of the packaging materials referenced Australia."
1702,"I'm definitely in the minority here when I say that I do not like my medialink wireless-N router. I was skeptic when purchasing this because it cost only $50 while other wireless-G routers from linksys were the same price. But the exceptionally high number of positive reviews made me click the &#34;buy&#34; button. How I regret it now! The 2-stars I'm giving to this are purely for the customer service. The product itself deserves less than 1 star. The problems I faced with this router are dropped connections. In the ~5 weeks that I have had this, I've had to restart this router once every 2 days. I read through the bunch of questions asked by fellow customers here and answered by medialink tech support and tried everything that was suggested. Still no luck. I even bought a range extender wanting to believe that this router can not be bad after receiving 1400+ positive reviews... &#60;sigh&#62; May be I got a lemon, but I'm going to review what I have received.Lessons learned:1. You get what you pay for2. Medialink tech support rocks but you can not polish a turd"
1703,"I replaced a 10 year old router with the Medialink router. My download speeds went from 11-12 to 19-20, my wired connection is 23 to 24. Easy to connect and has worked flawlessly.Updated review: I just updated to the Comcast Extreme 105, my wired download speed is between 95 and 100, my wireless download speed on a desktop 5 feet away is still 19 to 20. My download speed on a laptop in another room is 19 to 20. My upload speed is faster than my download speed over wireless, 21 to 22 upload. Medialink customer service responded quickly and shipped me a new router that had the same results as the first router. The Medialink tech rep said that 19 to 20 is the max download speed I should expect from their wireless router. If that is the case why don't they just call the router a Medialink 19 or 20 Mb router? I did not expect the wireless speed to be the same as the wired speed but I did expect it to be a hell of a lot closer than this. I would not recommend this router to anyone with wired download speeds over 25 Mbps."
1704,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine program.Well what a disappointment; although the box and the instructions say this keyboard is compatible with Android, it seems my ZTE/AT&T; ""Avail"" smartphone (Android 2.3.4) won't pair with this keyboard, saying ""Sorry, that HID input device is not supported on this phone"" every time I try.And my HP Windows XP laptop with Bluetooth built in also won't pair with this keyboard either.So be careful and make sure your phone or computer or tablet will support this device and pair with it!"
1705,"I wanted this device so I could mount my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; in portrait mode aside my bed.  The mounting device has catches on two sides that will hold the tablet firmly in landscape mode.  There are no catches on the other two sides (friction I guess being assumed to suffice) -- unfortunately, when in portrait mode the tablet just slides out of the mounting bracket and falls onto the bed.  Device should have had adjustable grips on all four sides of the tablet holding bracket instead of just two.  Not recommended."
1706,"I purchased two of these based on all the positive reviews. I got one for a Panasonic in my living room and one for a Sony in my bedroom. The Panasonic hooked up right away. I cannot get the sound to work on the Sony. I have been on the phone for literally HOURS with Comcast, Sony and Energy Power trying to get it to work. Sony is sending me a firmware update for my TV in the hopes that it helps but another customer rep told me that it probably won't. Also, the remote control setup is ridiculous. I've set it up four times on the one in the living room and nothing. I'm going to package this up and return it."
1707,I loved this keyboard until the letters started FADING OFF! I din't even use it that often. It only took about a month of using it a couple times a week (no more) to have this happen. GGGGGGGRRRRRRR!
1708,this charger is very temperamental --  it only works 75 per cent of the time.  i can't recommend it.  look for something else.
1709,"Listened for a total of 3 minutes then submitted my return request with Company A. While they were definitely comfortable and very easy to pair, the faint, tinny and shallow sound just made me angry the more I wore them. I just couldn't take listening to great music as if I had cotton stuffed into my ears."
1710,"I mean, sorry I have to give this a bad review as well.  I receive alot of interesting items to review, at no cost to me, for the Company A Vine program and am always grateful for that privilege.  I get to choose the items I want which means if I don't like the product then it's my own fault.  I don't like this.  I also live in the Southwest (Phoenix) and we have several HD channels here which are live over the air.  I got one, sort of.  I used the iPad we bought last year and also found the connection bulky, the connecting procedure not entirely intuitive and the signal not great.  Wait ahile for this to improve or for better competitors to appear.  Not recommended."
1711,I bought a screen protector for a 7&#34; Kindle Fire and it was great. I upgraded to the Fire HD 8.9&#34; and thought I would be getting the same thing only bigger. When I got this one and opened the package what a disappointment. This is just a glorified clear screen protector and certainly not worth the 30 price tag. Get glare off the screen and dust and print show drastically. Save your money and buy something worth it.
1712,"I thought this was going to be a nice addition to a 50&#34; LED TV... it was not! The sound is poor, the voice sounds hollow, not crisp, the bass is non existent, mid levels sound higher than other channels and makes difficult to hear the rest of the spectrum. Avoid it!"
1713,"While the charger does work to charge my laptop, the connector is loose and constantly falling out. It's good for charging if I'm not using it, but I need something that will stay put while I'm working.Shipping was swift and as a quick, fairly cheap temporary replacement, I suppose this is alright. I had initially ordered two, to use one as a back-up so I'm not caught without a charger again, but one will be going back and I will continue looking for a better charger.UPDATE: By early September, the charger connector needed to be contorted into a weird position (and kept that way) to actually charge the computer. A week later, I had to hold the charger in the computer for it to charge. A week later (last night), the connector broke off entirely.  I got less than 3 months use out of this. What a piece of junk."
1714,"I used to own another Sony Cybershot camera a long time ago.  This one is made of cheap flimsy plastic body.  The sides are metal, but they seem to be made without care to detail.  Made in China.  I didn't try taking a picture with this, and just returned it.  Canon cameras seem to be made better."
1715,Laptop was fine for a couple months and then HARD DISK died for no reason while I was surfing the internet??I had a Sony for more than 4 years without a problem - this laptop is a piece of junk.The screen is of horrible quality and hurts your eyes after a couple hours using it.

1717,"My initial impression of the &#34;HooToo HT-UH008 USB 3.0 Hub, 7 Port, Bus-Powered&#34; was favorable, as it seemed to work with no problems. Just now however, after seven days of use, none of the ports were working, even though the power light was on and the hub is plugged into a power adapter. I left a flash drive in one slot and unplugged the power adapter -- and the hub started working again. Plugged the power adapter back in, and it still works. So...for the reasons given below, I'll give it another two weeks, and if it behaves itself, I'll keep it.Here are the pros:- Works for low-power devices even when not plugged into the power adapter. Even my USB 3.0 portable hard drive worked -- but at about 10% of its normal performance.- With the power adapter plugged in, and several low-power/low-bandwidth USB 2.0 peripherals plugged in -- keyboard, flash drive, printer -- the USB 3.0 hard drive achieved the same throughput when plugged into the hub as when plugged directly into the computer.- There's lots of room between the USB ports, making plugging/unplugging easy."
1718,This was intended to replace a call blocker that wore out after 2-3 years.  The other blocker was stand-alone with its own controls.  This model relies on your telephone handset to make settings.  Doesn't work with mine so I'm still in the market for a replacement.
1719,"Resistive touchscreens are difficult after using capacitive screen for a long time. Rtouchscreens are touch-sensitive computer displays composed of two flexible sheets coated with a resistive material and separated by an air gap or microdots. Because the touchscreen responds to pressure on its surface, contact can be made with a finger or any other pointing device. When using  bare finger operation, the resistive screen's poorer responsiveness to light touches has caused it to lose market share to capacitive screens these days.  It is definitely hard to use after I used for few hours. 512 MB RAM is a deal breaker. No Google Play is a deal breaker.But the price is unbeatable. As a throwaway tablet just to browse web this may be good. But you can get quality ASUS or Samsung Tab 2 for few more bucks. Well, not few more double. I would suggest investing little more and buying a quality one rather than suck to the low performing capacitive one. Coby themselves have a resistive one, which I am going to try next week."
1720,"Keyboard works well. It has a reasonable touch, and doesn't seem to suffer from the &#34;dropsies&#34;, ergo not recording what you typed, like many other much more expensive keyboard covers. What doesn't work is the auto on/off feature due to the cover spine not keeping the two sides evenly closed. Even with the strap closed, the top and bottom sides of the case can slide out of alignment thus taking the Kindle out of sleep mode. In  a briefcase you can wind up with a dead battery fairly quickly."
1721,"This was my first and last time trying a Nikon Camera. Nikon was a great SLR camera producer in good old days. I had a Nikon professional SLR more than ten years ago, I remember loving that camera.This camera has major mechanical issues. On/off button is kind of numb, you may need to press multiple times to start the camera.The way, the camera works and sounds mechanically feels like it will break in a few months. So I didn't take my chance.Also, pop up flash is an another annoying thing in this camera, when you try to press half way it doesn't pop up and if you press all the way, it opens up and takes the picture without focusing.Flash is a total failure, it takes the pictures in a extremely bright light, you cannot recognize the people. If you take out the flash, then it is very dark.It works well in the day light. But a camera in this level should do a better job.I didn't have any problem connecting it through wifi or using GPS. These works fine.Price dropped sharphly for this camera, even it is now cheaper than some older models. It feels like Nikon knows there is a major issue in this camera and trying to get rid of their inventory and end of manufacturing this camera."
1722,"You get what you pay for. I bought this to work with a RikoMagic Mini PCIt does what is advertised but does not do it well. Touch pad is near useless. Keypad is intermittent, sometimes it won't register the button press and other times it will register the press twice forcing you to constantly correct your typing. The battery does not hold a very good charge, It only lasted a few days with minimal use (maybe 30 minutes a day over the course of 4 days) and the cable provided to charge it is USB only so you can't use a wall socket to charge the device.Ultimately I have found that I just get frustrated with it and end up using the wireless keyboard and mouse I used with my laptop when I wanted to use it like a desktop unit.Its a really nice concept but I would be willing to pay more money for a better built device of the same size."
1723,"I had high hopes for this handy device to help me control a NEO X7 mini (fantastic unit, BTW) I had just picked up.After reading the myriad of reviews here and elsewhere, it sounded like a great unit with a cheap price.However, the one I got stopped working after 1 day. Every time I would use the touchpad, it was as if I hit the media player button. The unit was not abused or dropped - I only used it 1 day - so it was the fault of the unit itself.It wasn't the X7, as the same thing happened when plugged into a Windows laptop.I want to let everyone know that there is ZERO tech support for this unit, anywhere - not even on the manufacturer's website. I thought that I might be able to perform some sort of reset on it, or maybe get some more clear instructions on what the cryptic looking blue keys do - but none was to be found.The reason this review gets 2 stars is that I realize I got a bad one and that Company A's refund policy is nice and easy. I will be trying something else."
1724,"Well, it works, barely. That is about all I can say about it. It was supposed to be fast... yeah. right. It booted up after I cloned it all right, but but the thing was about 5 times slower than the one I already had in my mac. It was SO slow and cumbersome, I took it back out and stuck it on the shelf for a spare.  Hardly worth the money if you ask me. I would not buy another one."
1725,Have to send this back because of that really cheap and flimsy but I do like the concept of the Bluetooth keyboard on the concept of it was great unfortunately I just have to buy a better quality one
1726,"Bass is far too heavy. the audio is terribly boomy even with the bass turned all the way down and the treble turned all the way up. There is no mid range whatsoever. The unit went back despite the good build quality and reasonable price. I think the Bose Soundock Mini wins the prize for audio but I picked up a UE Boom and am quite happy. The UE Boom is much smaller, delivers incredible audio for its size, has a 15 hour battery life, and is water resistant as well. I hope this helps. Also I hope TDK is listening... stop using NIMH batteries and switch over to Lithium ion or polymer batteries. They are far superior for this type of application."
1727,"I had my expectations on this TV pretty high. I've always bought Samsung TVs. I have 3 others, and this one I was buying to put in place of my LN52A750 (a fantastic TV, and still using today). I had my eye on all the Samsung TVs as the 2012 models were released. Those had mixed reviews, so waited another year. As soon as the 2013s were released, I had my eye on the 8000 series LED, and this one, the 8500 Plasma. Due to the size of my entertainment center, I was between either the 60"" plasma or 65"" LED. After months of reading reviews, looking at the TVs on showroom floors, and what not, I pulled the trigger on the PN60F8500. Boy was I excited! My thoughts and experience below-Shipping:The white glove service is the way to go, whether it's through Company A or one of the other 3rd party retailers. I didn't want to have to hassle putting it on the stand and into the entertainment center myself. I prefer to hook up all the cables myself, but the rest, someone else can do. They'll even take away the box if you want, but I decided to hang on to it just in case I needed to return it.Styling:Before turning it on, I had mixed feelings on the styling of the TV. I knew what it looked like beforehand of course, and even before the purchase I thought it looked a bit outdated. However, I decided to look past that, thinking that when I'm actually watching TV, I will only be concerned with the quality of the picture. I told my wife my thoughts on the styling about a week after we got the TV, and she said, ""Yeah, I thought the same thing, but I didn't want to say anything."" Haha. Anyway, this is obviously personal preference. Some people will love it, others will not care, and some won't like it. In the end, I still don't think a decision should be made off how it looks, rather the picture quality and viewing experience.Picture Quality:Out of the box, not changing any settings - the picture is excellent. However, there are some tweaks to the settings that are needed (see below). Off angle viewing to the sides is good. However, you don't want to be looking down at this TV (fortunately, for me, my setup has the TV somewhat above eye level when sitting, so I only noticed standing and near the TV). A downward angle creates a very dim picture. I'm guessing this has something to do with the anti-glare screen on the TV, which by the way is very good. I was concerned that there may be too much light in the room for a plasma, but didn't notice anymore glare than what was on the LN52A750 in the same space. The PN60F8500 might even have less. Overall, picture quality is why I bought this TV. The reviews had been great, and I can attest the picture is crisp, colors are vivid, blacks are very black, etc. Nobody has been lying when they say all those things. I made minimal changes to the picture settings, but there are 2 that I think are absolutely necessary:-For me, the cell light was on around a 15 by default. The picture was much too dim, and I had to put the cell light all the way up to the max (20). I also enabled the sensor that detects light in the room and adjusts accordingly, thinking that 20 would probably be too bright in a dark room. I put the minimum cell light at 15. After the change, I was happy with how bright it was, regardless of the light conditions in the room.-Turn off Motion Judder. This setting creates some weird movements. If you notice a person with slow then quick movements that seem unnatural occurring on the screen, it's likely because of this setting. Many reviews have already talked about this setting, and I too highly recommend that it is turned off. Many 1 star reviewers I think had this setting on. Anyway, if you turn it off, the motions are much better, more natural, and you'll enjoy it much more.Remote:The Smart Touch Remote is the only remote that comes with the TV. There is a HUGE learning curve to use this remote. And to put this in perspective, I'm a guy in my late 20s who is very tech savvy, and is often treated as the IT Help Desk by my friends and family. So if I'm having issues with the remote, I'm fairly sure others will too. I'd suggest either buying another Samsung remote (the old school style with more actual buttons), or using a universal remote. Samsung includes an IR blaster to control a set-top box, but I did not use it.Voice Control:This feature was nearly useless for me. The response time was slow. It would pick up sound randomly, thinking I was trying to talk with the TV because you can say something like, ""Hello TV,"" to activate the voice control. When it waits for commands, the TV sound goes off. So that happening randomly because it picks up a conversation in the room was a bit annoying. When I actually did want to use the voice control, it wasn't very good at understanding the commands. I have a Samsung GS3, and my wife has the GS4. Both phones have great voice control. So I'm not sure why this TV can't be as good. Seems like they would have used the same voice recognition technology. Anyway, I ended up just having to turn off the TV voice control entirely.Motion Control:Surprisingly, I found this feature to work fairly well. However, I didn't find many opportunities to use it and ended up turning it off. So I'll just leave it at that.Camera:The camera is a cool add-on if you want to Skype. There are some other apps that use the camera as well, but I didn't use them. The camera can be hidden just by pushing it in to the tv, and easily pops out. However, this has to be done by hand. There is not button or auto setting to have the camera pop up when needed, which would be nice. It's a little creepy having a camera always looking at you. A problem I had with the camera is the angle of it. There is a small roller on top of the camera that can adjust the camera angle up or down slightly. However, the adjustment is minimal, and even adjusted all the way down, you could just see the top of heads sitting on the couch. For others, this may not be an issue, just depends on your setup. In the end, I had the camera hidden most of the time. Also if you do not have the camera out, the TV will prompt you that motion control will not be available unless you turn off motion control. A little annoying to get the pop up every time I turn on the TV or use the Smart Hub, so I ended up turning off the motion control.Smart Hub:There are multiple screens within the Smart Hub. I found them to be useless except the Apps. If you have Netflix, Company A Prime or some other streaming service that is compatible, this is an excellent, very convenient way to stream. I had previously used a PS3 for these tasks, but greatly prefer the Smart Hub apps over the PS3. In general the interface is the same if you're already familiar with the PS3, and I would guess it would look about the same if you had a Roku, Xbox, or Apple TV or some other streaming device. I use a wired internet connection to the TV, so not sure if the same experience applies to WiFi, but I did not have issues with buffering. In addition to Netflix and Company A Prime, I also used MLB.tv and Spotify. Both good, but did have a little trouble with the initial setup of my Spotify account and playlists. Eventually, it worked. One other thing to note is that by default the Smart Hub will load when you turn on the TV. My personal preference was to disable that setting, and just have it turn on to the video source I was last using (usually HDMI 1).RVU:I have DirecTV and had initially planned on using RVU on this TV instead of a box. I have the new Genie setup which supports it, and thought this might be a little bit better. If you aren't familiar with RVU, it allows you to watch your programming without having a box. It just goes directly into the TV. I don't quite understand the setup. If I understand correctly, it uses the ethernet port. In theory it sounded great, but by using RVU, you are at the mercy of the Samsung remote. You cannot use a DirecTV remote if you are using RVU. I already discussed my thoughts on the remote, but the big problem I had was that Samsung doesn't allow the full functionality of the DirecTV remote. You either have to use the Samsung Guide, which isn't as good as DirecTV's, or you have to swipe and click through multiple pages to get to DirecTV's guide. Other features to control fast forward, rewind, pause, setting a recording, etc are all much more difficult. Features like bringing up the scoreguide, starting a program from the beginning, etc. are cumbersome. In the end, I just ended up getting another DirecTV box so I could use a DirecTV remote. I'm not sure if a universal remote would fix these problems with RVU control or not. I think the issue really lies with the interface of Samsung and it's compatibility with DirecTV function. I think that a universal remote using RVU would still limit you to the commands that a Samsung remote would send to the TV. So in my experience, I'll stick with the DirecTV box to keep my features.Chromecast Compatibility:You might be thinking, ""Why are you hooking up a Chromecast to a TV with so many apps and other features, including Allshare?"" Well, I liked the idea of looking at a YouTube video on my computer and then just asking it to play on my TV with a click of a button instead of having to search for it again. Plus, my experience with Allshare on non-Samsung products has not been great. I was hoping Chromecast would be better at sharing tabs, but see my Chromecast review for that. Anyway, Chromecast would not work on the PN60F8500. When first powered on, it would say something like ""Starting your Chromecast..."" Then, go black. Then, it would give me the Samsung ""No Signal"" floating message. I tried it in every HDMI port, with wall power, and using USB power. Made sure all the firmware and software was updated on the TV and Chromecast. No luck. Tried calling Google support and Samsung Support. After all kinds of troubleshooting, nobody had an answer, and the last Samsung support person (escalated), pretty much gave up and said it was probably a compatibility issue. Well I'm not sure why it would work on 3 other Samsung TVs, including another 2013 model (UN40F5500), and 2 that are much older TVs, but not work on the newest, top of the line model. Blaming this one on the TV, and not Google since the device works elsewhere. However, it's not a deal breaker, especially since the Chromecast is $35 and the TV is $2,400. Just would have been nice if it worked like it does on my other TVs. Plus, it makes me wonder if there are other things I'll want to plug in to the TV later and whether or not they would work too.Buzzing:One of the many complaints I saw on the 2012 plasmas was buzzing, and was a big reason I waited for the 2013s. I talked with friends with plasmas made from various other manufactures, and asked if their plasmas had a faint/loud buzz to it. Had a mixed bag of answers. I also read many reviews for the 2013 Samsung plasmas that said they didn't hear any buzz. Tried listening for the buzz in stores, but didn't (and didn't really expect to given the noise level in stores). So rolled the dice and hoped my TV wouldn't buzz. Within hours of having my TV on for the first time, I noticed it. It was soft enough that with sound on at normal levels, you wouldn't hear it. If the TV was off, it wouldn't buzz. It was just if the volume was muted, or very soft, it was noticeable. For myself, I have many reasons I mute the TV, and every time the buzz plagued my ears. I thought maybe it would just be me, slightly amplifying it in my head because of my fear from reading so many bad reviews about buzzing. So I didn't say anything to anyone, and just waited to see if anyone would say something. Sure enough, first time the TV was muted, my wife asked me if the sound was normal. A couple days later, she commented again how much she hated the buzzing. My thoughts were confirmed. I talked with Samsung about it, they said some buzzing is normal, but when I told them I could hear it sitting 8-10 feet away, they too admitted it's louder than it should be. They said there were some picture settings that sometimes affect the buzzing - brightness and contrast. I didn't want to hurt the picture quality, but for troubleshooting purposes, I adjusted the setting up and down as requested, and still buzzed. They said it could be a loose cable. I unplugged everything except the power cable, still buzzed. They asked if I was at high altitude. Dallas, TX being at 430' I said no, but apparently high altitude can cause the TV to buzz. If you always have the sound on at normal levels, you probably won't be bothered by the buzz. And if that's you, then ignore the buzzing comments. If you occasionally have the TV on, but muted like me, I'd be hesitant. The buzzing is one reason, I'll probably stick to LEDs from now on.Heat:I'm not sure if it was normal or not, but walking past the TV, I always noticed a strong heat coming off the front of the TV. Just making note of that...Randomness:There were a few random things that happened with the TV, and I'm not sure what caused them. I couldn't duplicate it, but still something to note in case it happens to anyone else:-One time the TV made a few loud tonal sounds, as if it was having a hard time processing the audio (which by the way I have output through optical). It lasted no more than 5 seconds, but several different tones, and then the TV just turned off on its own. I turned it back on soon after, and everything seemed to be okay. It only happened once.-Randomly, a quick flash would appear, almost like part of the picture from a frame was missing. It would only be in one part of the screen, the rest of the frame would be fine, and it was so quick it was almost like a blink. I think this might have only happened while watching Netflix, but could not pinpoint it to that, and might have happened elsewhere. If it was Netflix, then maybe there was an issue receiving or processing over the connection (but it didn't buffer, so not sure about that). There's also the possibility that something was wrong with the TV in general.After 2 weeks, I felt I had enough time to figure out if I should keep the TV or send it back. I decided to return it, and Company A was very helpful. The return service even took the TV off the stand, and re-boxed it. In general, the picture quality was very good. The added bells and whistles were not needed except the Smart Hub Apps. The buzzing, heat, and random issues listed above ultimately made me doubt the purchase. After spending $2,400 on the TV, I wanted to be sure I loved the TV, and not just live with it. I'm still a Samsung fan, and will be replacing it with UN65F8000 very soon. Hopefully, better luck there. It won't fix the problem of the remote or some of the added features (voice control, RVU, etc), but that's okay. I just won't use the Samsung Remote or the quirky features. If it doesn't buzz, picture quality is good, doesn't have random issues, doesn't overheat, and maybe even compatible with Chromecast, I think I'll be happy. The extra 5 inches doesn't sound so bad either. We'll see..."
1728,"I wanted to like this.  but the shortcomings are as bad as the other reviewers say.  the worst thing is, I have a LG smart television, and it's great, but this blu-ray player has a terrible interface (and the TV has a good interface), the blu-ray doesn't have Company A Prime, and the blu-ray's magic remote sucks (compared to the tv magic remote, which i like).  If feels like it was made in a separate factory or something where they don't know what they're doing."
1729,"Very disappointed. My daughter wanted this for her iphone. The description says that it will work with 5C, but it does not. Some of the buttons are covered by this hard plastic case. Frustrating, because with the real Lego back it is such a fun case, but only get this if you have the 5S."
1730,"From the reviews, I had great hopes for this device. I am in a location that disallows me to receive OTA TV broadcasts (at the edge of distance AND in a low area) or my cable would've been gone long ago. Since I seldom watch anything other than local news and one or two of the season's various &#34;talent&#34; shows I must admit getting hooked on, I had hoped I could find a decent quality and decent price STB to allow me to go to the generic cable out of the wall like we used to have, still get HD programming (which does come clear QAM through the cable) and return the cable company's STB while going back to their lowest level, fundamental, signal out of the wall subscription that you can't even tease out of their website any longer.The function of this box is stellar. It found all the channels quickly and easily. Moreover the firmware has, with time and messing around, enough different ways to re-order and rename the clear channels found to even get around the mess the cable company has made of bare channel ordering pre-STB since they can map it as they wish with their STB. I didn't have the box in use long enough to determine how good or not the EPG was but, while it appeared rudimentary, probably would've been just fine for my basic TV needs. When you add in that a USB port would allow playback of movie and image files from a USB disk, it seemed in my quick review to be able to turn the device into a DVR with the simple addition of an USB HDD. That is a lot of technical goodness in a small and inexpensive box like this.However, on a 90&#34; full 1080p projector with known stellar image quality, I could not get a decent HD image to save my life. This is a deal breaker no matter how cool the box is and ultimately returned it. If your needs aren't for a crisp LARGE image or need to connect to an older SD tv, this is a great device.My quest continues."
1731,"Had to give this a poor rating just due to the issues with the launch version.Total usage time, less than 3 hours.  Failed to start intermittently, shut down twice, blue line of death with unresponsive power button intermittently.Company A is getting this back.  Between this and the reported failures for the X1 coming out I've cancelled that pre-order and I'll wait and see how these systems shake out.  Right now these new consoles just seem flaky."
1732,"After four hours on tech support with Roku and several emails written by support personnel who evidently kept no notes, a senior tech finally revealed that the Roku 3 outputs only Dolby Digital Plus and supports no other 5.1/7.1 formats over its HDMI connection.Make sure your receiver/TV supports Dolby Digital Plus before buying this product or be sure you are satisfied with stereo output. (Of course your receiver may be able to simulate 5.1 from Roku stereo output, but that's not what one would hope for.) I also found that if I changed audio modes on my Denon receiver, all audio was lost until I turned the receiver off and back on. I've never experienced this problem with another audio/video source (tuner, TV, DVD or blu-ray player).In addition, Netflix over the Roku consistently started out with a blurry picture, but that it would clear up in a minute or so. After that the picture was fine.Roku needs to make it explicit that the Roku 3 only supports Dolby Digital Plus. I'm sending it back."
1733,"My kids recently pooled their Christmas money to purchase a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. This case looked like it would be a good one when we first received it. Unfortunately, this particular case is clearly not designed for the Kindle Fire HD that we have as the holes are in the wrong place. We have to remove the Kindle in order to turn it on & off and also to charge it. That kind of defeats the whole purpose of the case.It's really too bad because the case itself is good."
1734,"Overall construction and finish was nice.  Unit I received had a sticky volume control and overall sound quality was poor.  I purchased to improve on the sound quality of a Sceptre LCD TV.  After hooking the sound bar speaker up, I felt the the TV speakers were better.I ended up returning this product."
1735,"I loved the idea.  Something I could plug in my battery while I used the spare.  Something I could even charge my phone and the spare at the same time.  But problems occurred while charging.  It took way too long to charge both my phone batter in the phone and the spare in this charger.  In fact, sometimes it would never fully charge even after a couple days.  Sometimes, it only charged the phone but not the spare when both plugged in.  Worst was the durability.  After a month, the plug to attach my phone didn't work half the time.  After another 15 days, the plug for the charger wouldn't work."
1736,Not work the price for just this wrist strap.  It was not what I thought it was when I ordered.
1737,"Turn the wifi capability off and this works great. However, with the wifi on, it is nothing but trouble. The remote keeps resetting to thinking everything is off, the receiver freezes and won't accept commands, etc. It's just a nightmare to deal with. With the wifi off though you can't use the phone apps instead of the remote and you have to manually connect the remote to download updates instead of just getting them wirelessly. Also, the usb port for the remote is in a narrow spot. Not all usb cables will fit it so don't lose the one that came with the remote. On the bright side since the receiver is USB powered you can use a multi-port charger instead of the charger that came with it if you have multiple USB powered devices in your entertainment center. The same goes for the remote charger. Still, for the price, I expect all the features to work as advertised."
1738,This case is cheaply made. If you are looking for a protective case this is not the one to buy. I was not impressed with the quality. Had to return it.
1739,"Really difficult to install.  Problem is that the shield is the &#34;exact size&#34; of the screen.  With no tolerance, it is almost impossible to align the shield exactly. Even with just a fraction of misalignment the shield will lift during normal use.  I wasted two shields and still did not get it right.  The third, I trimmed to allow for misalignment."
1740,"Don't buy this camera. Very disappointed in Canon customer service. I read about the bug in the battery indicator but saw one post that the firmware update had fixed it. It has NOT. I sent it back to Canon TWICE and both times they sent it back unfixed. The second time they claimed the issue is that the battery runs out more quickly on video mode, and that is the problem. It's NOT. The battery appears full in most photography modes, but AS SOON AS YOU SWITCH TO VIDEO MODE, the battery flashes red and appears to be out of juice. This also occurs for us in Sport Mode. So while this camera works fine if you only want to take photos, you cannot take videos because it thinks it's out of battery power. I'm angry with Canon customer service that they have failed to address this claim and deny its existence, returning to me a poorly functioning camera."
1741,"This case is light and stylish, but that's where the positive end. The biggest problem is the stand--it doesn't work. The front cover flips back to stick to a magnet in the back. The magnet is so weak that it can't support the tablet. The tablet just falls back. The second problem is that there is no protection for the sides of the tablet. I've already noticed a couple of scuffs on the side edges. This case is way too expensive for having these flaws. This is my third case. I've bought two other cases on the internet. They both caused my tablet to unexpectedly timeout and caused the lock screen to become unresponsive. The problem appears to be with the magnets on the front and/or the case partially touching the tablet's front screen. I can't believe it so much trouble to simply find a functional case."
1742,"This doesn't seem to allow the iPad to stand up very easily. Otherwise, it is sufficient protection and ease of use."
1743,"The first time I installed a CF card I was concerned that the fit was too tight.  After a few uses the cards slid in without too much effort yet I had to be very careful to evenly push the card evenly into the reader.  This is because the card barely goes into the reader before it engages the contact pins.  If you push in a card  unevenly I feared it would bend the pins. I lent it to a friend and he returned it saying it didn't work.  I looked at the pins and they were bent.USB 3 compared to USB 2 transfer speed is jaw dropping.  Instead of spending 20 minutes transferring full 36G CF cards in takes 2 minutes.  At the end of a long shoot day, it's nice to be able to spend my time resting rather than transferring data.Recommendation:  Get a different reader."
1744,"...and I couldn't find sufficient online support to overcome the problem. It also makes an audible sound when switching between day and night modes and has very bright LEDs, so I think it would be obtrusive in any room where people were (except maybe a noisy dance bar or something like that)."
1745,"When you look at the features for the Samsung SF 8000 65 released in 2013, the say this is an accessory, but you do not nee it. The TV is already equipped with this. I sent it back."
1746,not excited with it.  times out to quick.  went crazy the other day.... i had to completely restart my computer.

1749,"I should have waited until the price of this product came down as I really prefer the menus and interface of the Xbox 360 to this new system.  things you used to be able to do in one click are now not that simple, and take you away from your gameplay.  All the talk of multitasking and kinect upgrades are way over rated and you will never use them.  Basically wait until bundles come out or when one without a bluray player or other cost reductions happen and bugs are figured out."
1750,"The cord has not worn out, broke, or frayed. However, after a couple of month of use the cord started to work properly. At first to correct the problem all I had to do was flip the cable over. This went on for a week or two. Then I started to have to unplug the cord from the wall and back in for it to be detected by my iPhone. This worked again for a while, and now I have tried other USB wall adapters and still the cord is not detected by my iPhone. I was going to purchase another one of these, but with the problem I have encountered my confidence in this product or even any Skiva product is almost none. I don't think I could recommend their products."
1751,"Will never have a chance to test the camera - it comes with a proprietary USB charging cable which requires yet 1 more cable to travel with the lose and not be able to do anything until you fork over another $40 and wait.  None of the Sony, Nikon or Fuji products have this shortcoming.The camera may be OK, but when you look at the price and see what you get, something has to give.  Too bad it's the quality."
1752,"I bought this monitor hoping to have a beautiful upgrade with good gaming performance over my old 17&#34; LCD. Although it was great for games, it ended up going back because I couldn't bare to use it for anything else. After less than 10 minutes, I had eye strain to the point of causing headaches. It's odd because you'd expect less eye strain with a higher refresh. I made sure the monitor settings were right and tried 120-144 hz. In the end, I went with an IPS monitor instead. Although refresh rate isn't high, at least I can use it without eye strain. I also noticed it was very &#34;washed out.&#34; By that I mean the colors were not popping, you could see artifacts around shortcuts, icons, etc. It's just nowhere near worth the money for what you get. If I was to pay $400+ for a monitor, it should work for all uses, including gaming. Not just gaming.PROS* Refresh rate is unreal, thus gaming performance is good* Size is the sweet spot* Adjustments are goodCONS* Washed out* Caused eye strain"
1753,"For me this was a waste. I purchased this strap for my other camera, a canon 550D.  Once I put the strap on the camera it wanted to come loose at the clips. It wouldn't stay at all, I had to pull the cord's with the clips all the time to tighten it up. Dont waste your money!!!  I just purchased and got the VINTAGE VNH Muilti-color Neck Strap for my canon 550D and it work's perfect.  Perfect fit, with no slipping at all!!  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BIRUGEAR PINK NEOPRENE STRAP FOR ANY CAMERA!!!"
1754,"I knew better, but fell for a sale. Relatively &#34;small&#34; capacity with an output of 1A. Not a valid iPad or tablet backup battery option since larger screen devices require a 2A input charge."
1755,"The sleeve for iPad Air is softer than that for the iPad Mini 2! iPad Air sleeve barely fit iPad Air and the Smart Cover, however, the iPad Mini 2 with the Smart Cover is not that easy to put into this sleeve! These cases are very &#34;stylish&#34;, but the downside is, again, they are too tight for iPad whatever with the smart cover! Oh, yeah: you can use the iPad Air for iPad Mini 2. Just joking. Seriously, Both sleeves are in my trash can."
1756,"Must be hard wired to the server/modem.  Very little movie choices and very expensive.  I purchased a set of internet expanders that plug into the electrical wall outlets but the download speed is so, so.  This product needs wifi and more movies at a reasonable price."
1757,"Tried it in our city row home and it simply didn't work -- even when I held it out the window.  Maybe there was too much interference from neighboring homes and trees, but it didn't work in my environment.  On the other hand, returning it to Company A was very simple and hassle free."
1758,It works well on my cell but not on the tablet as I wanted to work in all my mobile devices
1759,"I purchased these to hopefully extend the strength and range of my Asus RT-AC66U Router.  The antenna is significantly larger than the stock antenna.  Within about 10FT of the router signal was significantly stronger, but as I backed away, performance fell.  2.4GHz had about a 5% improvement at longest range, however 5GHz degraded by about 10%. Some people have had different results and it must depend upon the construction of your building but I would not recommend this upgrade."
1760,"I own several other Adonit pens, and I'm happy with them. They write smoothly and mimic the feel of a pen in your hand. I purchased this one, hoping it would overcome the plastic disc issue you have with the other Adonit pens. Unfortunately, this pen doesn't work very well at all. The writing is not smooth. The pen has difficulty connecting and often loses connectivity when writing, which causes it to stop writing completely. I would recommend purchasing one of the other Adonit pens."
1761,This did not fit well nor did it stay on well.  It was very difficult to get rid of the air bubbles when you placed the screen protector across the screen.  A waist of money.
1762,"This is a rare misfire from Company A. The case is heavier than other options, and it's actually quite difficult to get the Kindle in a good position to stand, especially in bed. I ended up buying the Poetic case and am much happier."
1763,"I heard about this device on a TV advertisement.  Thought it would be a good thing to have to transfer online videos to the TV for viewing.  Be aware that there are no specifications given to tell you what you need for this item to work.  Your OS has to be &#34;7&#34; or above and you have to have an updated modem.  Microsoft will tell you that you need to have &#34;Silverscreen&#34; to run the program, but windows doesn't like Google and once you have downloaded &#34;Silverscreen&#34;, Chromecast will tell you it is not compatible.  It has been a headache to get it to work and I am not there yet.  Really, with the quality of others Google products, I am quite surprised with this one - disappointed!"
1764,Unfortunately it is a crap mouse due to the buttons always ending up double clicking or not registering a click at all.  I have had 2 of these mice and both started having double clicks and missing clicks within a month of owning them. Save your money and get a better quality product. I had the logitech laser 1000mx for 3 years before it developed the double clicking problem. I cant even get a month out of these.
1765,"like others say, its a bit loose, but if you want a simple thin case to protect your device, it works, however, i think the $18+ spent on this ill fitting &#34;official&#34; case is not worth it, it has no magnet to turn the screen off and on when opening or closing it, and its too thin to put one on it (from an old blackberry case), while the button areas make it a bit hard to press the power and volume. avoid this item. it is &#34;officially&#34; not worth it."
1766,Adapter works great but Netgear wireless plug in component was a failure. Luckily I had another wireless component that plugged into the cable adapter which gave enough height to get good signal. Therefore two stars.
1767,"Originally I had Given it 5 stars but half a year later and the charging port has gone bad so unless they replace it, it was a waste of money.RE: So I just got off the phone with Asus and I am sending it in for repair so we will see what happens."
1768,"Pros: very small USB device.  Pretty much does what it says it does, and what you see in the videos.  Cons: it pretty much does what it says it does and what you see in the videos.  The problem is, that's just not very useful, and it's tiring to wave your hands in the air for very long.  Plus, the accuracy and calibration is poor, recognition of an actuating motion like a button push is weak and often fails.  The plain fact is, what it does just isn't a very effective way to interact with a computer, despite the fact the device is cool, or at least seems to be based on the hype-factory behind it.  And there's some factory, the PR on the thing makes it look like a game-changing device that you just have to have.  But what it actually has going for it is only that marketing machine.  Give it a pass, it'll blow over before long.  Save your money."
1769,"First of all, let me clarify that if your goal is to have a totally seamless bluetooth audio experience with automatic pairing the moment you fire your car up like the built-in systems available in newer cars, let me warn you that this product is not for you. I was under the false impression that it would work like this, but it actually has a power button that must be turned on for it to work even if it's plugged in. Unfortunately, this means you can't just leave the device on and leave it plugged into your car. It will run out of battery if you do, since it's not smart enough to go into a low power state or the like, and once that happens the memory on it will be erased. When this happens, your smartphone will not be able to connect to it correctly anymore, and you'll need to delete it from the list of bluetooth connections and pair it back up all over again, so make sure to always turn it off when not in use (which is incredibly annoying).Additionally, although the sound quality is okay, I've found that audio skips fairly often on this device. As frequent as 1-2x per song in some cases, even though the skips are brief it's still very annoying. I do know this isn't an issue with my phone, as I haven't had skipping issues in other cars or connected to other bluetooth receivers. For home use howver, I think this device would be fine for users, and it is nice that it does have a battery and can be used without the adaptor, so if that's your goal it should work for that, so long as you don't mind audio skipping, which I think most would find an issue with."
1770,This is the second car cam I bought.Bought on 05/19/14. Sent back on 06/16/14.Usb cable would not work upon arrival. Used one that I had from another device.Sometimes would not record event. It defeats the purpose of recording car accident.If you by it you are taking chances.Good luck!!
1771,"The unit is sturdy and feels nice. But did not work with a BobJgear case on an iPad mini. The lightening connector is adjustable fore and aft to fit case width from front to back, but the lightning connector is poorly designed and has a shoulder that is the size of the the old style 30 pin connectors. If you have a case that has a huge opening for the lightning connector then its fine, but if your case has a lightening connector sized hole it's not going to work. They should have made the height of the lightning connector adjustable too and not had a huge 30pin sized shoulder. I could have cut it with a Dremel tool to fit, but I wasn't going to do that when other docks are available that do not have this design flaw. Too bad, I wanted to like this item."
1772,"So i bought these for when I work out...They feel good and look ok... But they audio quality is horrible , I feel like I'm the one under water, that's how much they muffle the sound.  The positive thing is that people can hear me when I make a call.."
1773,the first one was trash. The 2nd one has about 5 bubbles but i decided to just leave it. i hope that it is protecting the screen from scratches I will find out when i replace it
1774,"Does not work well at all for the intention of use that I had for it....I wanted it to stream content directly from the unit / Loftek itself, howver, it STUTTERED alongand it was impossible to even watch a regular movie on it.Very disappointed in this unit.PS.. it worked fine as a Wireless Router, however."
1775,"We use TCI Cable for our television, Internet and phone.  We already receive a DVR box for free with the triple play option they offer but I thought it would be nice to have the option to record 4 shows at once instead of just two.  I purchased this and then realized after I spent most of the afternoon installing it that I had to pay a monthly or once in a lifetime charge to TiVo or it would not work.  It seemed rather ridiculous to pay more than I pay currently per month besides paying for the item up front.  TCI Cable is also offering an upgrade that would provide a similar service recording multiple shows (more than two) from one DVR box for television viewing throughout the home as well.  So we'll going to do that instead.  The set-up did go fine; but I was having some issues even setting up the account.  TiVo offers an online chat that helped me through that problem so no problems there.  This was just not a wise purchase for me."
1776,"Specification wise this camera is EXACTLY the same as SX160. The only difference is that the SX170 no longer takes AA batteries. Instead, it uses a proprietary battery. This pretty much destroys any portability the older SX models had. If my battery dies, that's it. You can't just walk into a store and buy a new set of cheap AA widely available batteries. Nope. You better had bought an additional Canon proprietary battery that will set you back nearly $40, AND you better made sure you charged it on the proprietary Canon charger.This is completely unacceptable. They took the one feature that made the SX160/SX130 series appealing and destroyed it. I guess I'm going to get an SX160 while they're still in stock.What a letdown. :("
1777,"The sound was great however the Bluetooth subwoofer would not stay connected despite being within 6' of the sound bar.  In order to reconnect, we had to unplug the sound bar and plug it back in and allow the sub to reconnect.  I really liked the sound, but the connection issue was annoying.  I moved to the Sony HT CT660 which has been solid."
1778,"I'd like to say that I'm pretty decent when it comes to applying screen protectors, but I just could not get this one right without bubbles. I used the same LCD cleaner and micro fiber cloth that I've always used and, even after eliminating 95% of the bubbles, the quality of the protector is still lackluster. I may am just being picky, but I it added a somewhat hazy effect that I didn't care for."
1779,Great concept but the app it uses is so bad that its almost useless... Slow shutter speed and 0 light adjustment... Unless you are outside in perfect lighting your photos look horrid... If they update the app then its a 5 out of 5
1780,"Great idea, flawed execution. A bad design means all wear gets focused on the weakest link.I originally rated it 4 Stars because while it worked great--letting me use cheap PC headphones with my iPhone--I worried that the weakest link would fail, and now it has: the skinny wire between the ""joint"" and the smartphone end has failed after fairly light use.It was never a fair fight: the ""female"" ends had two wires and both were of heavy construction.  The weight and stiffness of that end meant that the single skinny end was always being bent back and forth during ordinary use.A skinny wire + constant flexing between two heavy things (a phone and the headphone wires) meant premature failure."
1781,"I love the concept, but my AUX port quickly broke.  Since I bought refurbished I only had 30days to return which I wasn't able to do.  So I'm stuck using the bluetooth feature which isn't clear.  A good idea and good value for the money if it works,"
1782,"Check some of the reviews on the fall 2013 model Acer Company H, the C720.  It's been called the closest thing to the perfect Company H so far, and has a much better processor, better design, better battery life and better build quality than this C710.The Verge says, &#34;An update to last year's pretty terrible C7, the C720 is sleeker, lighter, and faster than before. And most importantly, it promises more than double the battery life of the previous model while still improving performance.&#34;So consider skipping this model altogether and going for the C720.  Both the 16GB SSD and 32GB SSD versions have been available on Company A (going in and out of stock) at around one hundred fifty dollars as of now.Acer C720-2802 Company H (11.6&#34;, 2GB RAM, 16GB SSD)Acer C720-2420 Company H (11.6&#34;, 2GB RAM, 32GB SSD)"

1784,"I was very excited unboxing my dropcam pro.  It was easy to set up right from the couch, I just plugged it in behind me and used my iphone to set up after downloading dropcam app.  When it does work, there is a slight delay in the audio/video which does not bother me.  But the camera has not been working.  When I load the app or website, I am usually left staring at a grey screen, or spinning circle indicating that the camera is ""loading.""  My camera is in the same room just 15 or so feet from my router, which is new, only a few months old.  Once the camera does load, I get a frozen image.  The timestamp stays frozen to exactly to when the camera finally loaded.  Performance is unacceptable...what good does the video quality do you if it does not work?  I will be returning and ordering a different camera from Company A.  I will probably try the d-link or netgear vuezone."
1785,"I did not realize some of the features listed require a monthly fee of $10.  (I should have read more carefully).  For a $200 camera, there really shouldn't be a monthly fee."
1786,No way to register product.. web site listed is bogus.. the real web site is [...].  No manuals or help files on the web site.  Have not tried the device yet but I can imagine there are going to be issues.  Will update the review once I check out the device properly.
1787,"These earbuds look great, but the sound quality just isn't up to par.  If your music is bass-heavy, especially, you will likely be disappointed, as these earbuds provide a very tinny sound that gets even more pronounced as the volume is increased.  I will use these to listen to audiobooks, but I'll save my music for other eadbuds.On a positive note, the Brainwavz buds are very comfortable, and you're provided with three pairs of silicone buds and one foam pair.Note - I was provided with a sample of this product for the purpose of review."
1788,"I didn't like this protector, So I returned it . don't go with this product as it is not so good."
1789,"This seemed like a simple DVR to use with an antenna.  It was easy to set up, and it got more channels than my previous tuner.  However, the picture was always stretched, even after fiddling with the aspect ratio and other view settings.  I have an older TV (the big fat tube kind).However, my main problem with it is that I mainly wanted it to be a DVR with time shift and to record the occasional program.  I tried several different hard drives, formatted as both NTFS and FAT32, USB keys, etc., and the box didn't recognize any of them. I'm returning it and trying for a different one."
1790,I bought this because I have a 2000 dollar sound system and my windshield was recently smashed. Basically 100% for security purposes. First off it claims to have a motion sensing feature. This feature literally only works if you put your hand right in front of the lens. Its motion detecting range is like 2 inches. Next it doesn't have night vision at all it just has a light on the front that you can turn on... nothing like making it obvious and wasting battery... Finally the rechargeable battery for it lasts maybe 30 minutes... If you are using this as a security camera you need to have it run off your car battery the whole night which can possibly leave your battery dead in the morning especially if you have the cameras light on which idk why you would...
1791,"This is kind of a crappy system. The sound is bad unless you use headphones, usb is only good for output, the touch screen is not that sensitive and off kilter when it comes to calibration, nothing in instructions for bluetooth. About the only thing it's good for is games. I like the OS interface (Google Jellybean) but the hardware is crap."
1792,"when I got this software, it did not come with the Microsoft key numbers, I contacted the seller, he said that he knew it, why would anyone want to sell you software they cannot use, I just hope Company A knows what this guy is doing!"
1793,"I pick up one of the Dahua after watching a few of the YouTube videos of it and being impressed with the video quality.  Since setting it up for my test environment I have had nothing but problems and issues with it.My setup:POE Switch -&#62;TP-LINK TL-SF1008PRouter -&#62; TP Link TL-WR1043NDAll wiring is CAT 5eThe good -&#62; Video quality is nice but when set at the higher resolution (3M or 1080P) but the video is too choppy.  Actually even when lower the resolution video is to choppy and will jump 2-3 seconds.  When there is movement in the video it will then again freeze up or become choppy.  I am currently testing it out with SXGA with a frame rate of 20FPS streaming at H.264 still no luck getting a quality video stream.The Bad-&#62; There seems to be no rhyme or reason with the automatic log off.  It seems that I am only able to get through 1 or 2 screens and wham I get log off!It seems that I will continuously get the IIS7 screen when trying to log back in.  After 20 seconds or so I just hit the F5 key and I will be back at the log in screen.Usually after a minute or so of viewing the Live Screen I will get a message of &#34;Resource is Limited, Failed to open video&#34;.  This is the only IP camera that I have.If I am unable to work out these snags by the end of the week I will be returning the camera.  No sense having a security camera if it keeps failing out on you."
1794,Only works with a few games
1795,"I used to ride with my iPhone and an extended battery but everybody was telling me to get a &#34;real&#34; bicyle computer. So when the garmin 1000 was announced, I took the plunge.There are many problems with the unit - some I sure hope are temporary - ie the many bugs : routing failures, random screen lock with no way to unlock, communication errors with the iPhoneBut then there seems to be a much more serious flaw: I bought the bundle in order to get better auto pause and speed analysis vs pure gps based: so I have 3 sensors connected (heart, cadence, speed) and my iPhone for messages and tracking. The battery under those conditions is about 7 hour - from 15 hours advertised - when I asked about it to garmin support (took a week to eventually get that answer &#34;Using the Bluetooth with the device will cut down on the battery life, as well as the sensors. The 15 hour battery life that is advertised is without any sensors, the bluetooth turned off, and no backlight.&#34; - without sensors and screen turned off I fail to see the benefit of a bicycle computer...I got a specialized device to not stress about running out of battery before a long ride ends... this unit fails for that."
1796,"This unique design is not an improvement to the classic backpack. You place items inside the main pouch (under the wide padded arms) and flip the arms over the zipped-up pack. Yes, it's good that it looks secure, but what about the traditional small compartment that's still exposed? An even smaller zipper pocket is above that (it's just the right size for popular smart phones).However, my main concern is that the design poorly distributes weight for medium-heavy and heavy loads.  There's a ribboned loop on the front of each arm strap for one to pull down in order to help relieve the weight. They can only do so much and then you're stuck with constantly puling at your pack. My teen son especially dislikes the fit/ feel.There's only padding for the wearer's back and arms. There's a laptop compartment that we can't use anymore because padding (on the bottom &#34;floor&#34; of pack) doesn't exist=no protection when setting bag down. I could also feel my lightweight (15 inch) laptop's bottom keep hitting the small of my back (below the back padding) when walking.The overall look and feel of this backpack is cheap and the design makes it a burden to wear for any good length of time when carrying (a weighed) 5 lbs. or more. Unfortunately, this weight is nothing close to what most students have to cary these days...I give it an extra star for the smart phone pocket and bottle holder."
1797,"I was looking for a tablet that was bigger than my HTC One M7 but wasnt as too large. I was looking in the 7-9 inch range when I found this. At half the price of Apple's iPad and Samsung's Tab S, this device is perfect. Its biggest competitor is the Nexus 7 which is made by Asus as well. I only needed the device for watching movies and tv shows from Netflix or other sources. I wanted something without huge bezels and wasted space. The Nexus 7 has a better screen, better build quality, and runs faster, but it is smaller, has way bigger bezels and doesnt have expandable MicroSD storage. MicroSD storage will allow me to put up to 128 gigs of movies and music on this device. Asus ZenUI isnt bad, but I like plain old Kitkat better. For the money this rocks.**UPDATE**After using this device I noticed it runs super slow. If I am running an app for a while and press the home button there is a 10 second delay before my apps and widgets fully load. Im not exaggerating I used a timer. Speeding up animation speeds made the device have to illusion of running faster but it is still very laggy. Kinda disappointed. I think it is the combination of cheap internals and poor performance optimization with Asus software. I feel that stock Android might work better. Should have gone with the nexus 7."
1798,I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR.  This did nothing to help or fix the problem.  Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???
1799,For users that travels a lot 100% recomended most cases when you need leave your notebook in some conference room or room hotel.
1800,"Good product and solid build quality. Looks very good.  Wanted to really keep it and tried hard to accomodate my Canon EOS 7D with EFS 17-55mm, f/2.8 attached. If you take the lens apart from the body - you can store both...but not attached. Plus not enough room left to store accessories (battery charger, cables, filters etc. Didn't fancy taking off the lens everytime..so had to return it and got the Canon Deluxe 200EG backpack instead."
1801,"This is a decent line conditioner. It filters out a lot of noise from my power, including all of my appliances. The one thing it can't seem to filter out completely, however, is the Dimmers on the torchier lamps. I can always hear when one of those darn things is on. Otherwise its a decent unit."
1802,"After being impressed with the MX-300s, I decided to give these a try. When I opened them up and tested them out, though, I was disappointed. While they have good range, there is too much treble and not enough bass. They can even sound tinny at times. The only major difference I found between these and the MX-300s was the higher treble and the volume control on the cord. I guess for the price difference I expected more, but these just aren't worth the extra money. If you're looking for a pair of Sennheiser buds, I'd recommend going with the MX-300s. They're inexpensive and have better sound than the MX-500s, in my opinion.I do have another complaint, and it is that the cord is way too short. When I came across these at an audio/video store, they had them in the dark blue and also in white, to match an iPod. I looked at the specs on the package, and while they were the same (as expected) the cord length was listed differently. The blue ones were stated as one meter (just over three feet), and the white ones read 1.2  meters (about four feet). I prefer a longer cord so I picked up the white pair mainly for that reason. However, these specs were incorrectly listed- the cord was actually only three feet. Now I plan on returning these, and I hope that mentioning the cord issue saves someone else the hassle.If you need a spare set and don't mind the cord or treble these may be good, but if you want more bass, keep looking. There are better ones out there."
1803,"I bought this specifically to use with my phone while sitting at my desk, so I didn't have to carry the phone with me.  It is great for sound, but the sound quality that goes back via the microphone on my headset (which is normally crystal clear) is terrible.  Constantly had to adjust the connector in the hole so the sound would get better, but it wouldn't stay that way for long.Good if you're just using it to listen to music or something - never had trouble with that - but not for talking.-D"
1804,"I'll start off by saying the tools were mostly great quality. they all felt solid and no doubt would be useful for small fixes round the house. However, I predominately work with laptops and the screwdriver bits are just too big for most laptops. There were a lot of different torque sizes, but only 2 Phillips heads and 2 or 3 flat ones. the ones that were provided were solid and worked well, but they were too large for laptop screws. It could have easily been fixed if they included smaller bits, but they did not. That's really my only gripe but since that was the only reason I bought it, I had to return it. No problem with quality and the price is cheap for what you get and I would have to blame myself if the kit wasn't marketed for computers but since it was I had to mark it down a tad. Will probably head to best buy and get the Dynex version I saw, as it's almost Identical to this but includes smaller bits as well for around the same price."
1805,"I purchased this case for building a computer and it fulfilled my expectations. The kit included a nice socket and bit set as wells as some wrenches. I have used the multiple tools in other non computer related instances. So versatility is a definite plus of this kit set. My issue is with the overall quality of some of the items: the flashlight lasted only a few hours with the batteries that came with the case. If they marketed this product as an anti-static kit, it would have been nice to have a anti-static wrist wrap included as well. A good case, however the fit and finish could have been improved upon in my opinion."
1806,"Even after following the instructions which came with the unit & those accompanying my FAX machine, it doesn't route the fax messages properly."
1807,"What can you say about a filter.  What are your expectations - that it be threaded metal and clear glass.  They got the threaded metal part perfect, the clear glass part is a different story. The filter had a definite used appearance to it. There were finger prints on the glass, the case was dirty, the foam inside the case wasn't entirely in the case.Having worked in a camera store, I know that things go in and out of their boxes so that people can try them for fit, etc.  Usually they are restored to new condition before they are put away.After a careful cleaning, I felt comfortable installing it on my new $1,000.00 lens. It now meets my expectations."
1808,I bought this filter to protect my lens on my GF3.  The filter will provide great protection for your lens but photographs will be negatively affected with this filter.  Shooting into a light source at an angle will affect your pictures.  This filter is priced really good but it I was looking for and hoping for something different.  The filter also came very dirty with smudges and finger prints.
1809,"I bought this for my Nikon 80~400 tele-zoom.I disappoint with its quality but then I realize this is budget and non-coated filter. However I will stick to 3 star thought it&#8217;s a budget filterIt does good job to protect the front glass of my lens however I prefer to remove during shoot, especially it is highly recommended when you shoot in direct sun or against light.Things that I like&#8230;- It screw on lens smooth, there was no scratch noise when I apply first time nor gives me feeling of damaging lens thread- Build quality is nice and the filter thickness is acceptable, tried mounting to other 24mm lens and did not find any vignetting- The lens transparency is fairly acceptable as I test on bright and dark background- Comes is good quality plastic boxFinally I will suggest to go for NC quoted filter, I will be buying one for myself soon and promise I will drop review here :)"
1810,"The looks of this device is pleasing to the eye, but one shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  I've had problems from day one.  Installation, connectivity and more.  To put this long story short, the hard drive on these babies almost always has problems.  A drawback is that the Archos 800 number tech support is disconnected!  What's bothersome is that they never respond to emails.  I guess they're going out of business soon.  I would not recommend this device no matter how tempting.  Creative has a Nomad Jukebox, I would go for that.I give this device a 2.5 stars (which rounds up to 3)"
1811,"I bought two of these three years ago.  They had all the right features for my application.  One is still going strong.  The other failed six months ago.  It's true that it was operating under a significant load, but  it wasn't tripping the reset.  I tried the reset, but no go - the switch was apparently burned out.  I'm going to buy another as a replacement, hoping it was just a one-of-a-kind problem."
1812,"I'm using a K7.  For many people this tiny remote is a 5 star for photos of the family during a birthday party, posing for a wedding and using a tripod. But I'm challenged and not excited. The position of the sensor on the camera is at the bottom front right side of the camera. When you put the camera on a sweater, your backpack, some object that supports the camera, fiddle with the camera to compose the photo, then try to take the shot, I frequently find the sensor is covered. Even if you put the camera on a tripod, but stand to the left side of the camera (imagine 5 people lined up and you are to one side) the lens can block the signal to fire the camera. You need to stand in the middle or right of the camera.  Some fiddling and planning is required to use the remote. The sensor on the K7 needs to be high and central to make excellent use of the Pentax remote. I'm going to need to purchase a more expensive but for me a more user friendly remote. This is so far my only complaint about the K7. I'll keep and use this remote as it's so tiny, but it can be ""quirky"" to use."
1813,"I've had this model and the equivalent Panasonic (RV31), and give the edge to the Panasonic.Both are good DVD players for non-digital TVs, particularly if the TV accepts colorstream component input.  Both have nice pictures, and colorstream component output.  Neither has progressive scan, which you probably won't notice unless you have a digital tv.  Both have miscellaneous features like &quot;audio enhance&quot;, a sound mode that tries to play dialoge at extra volume.  Both seem reasonably reliable and supposedly play audio CDs and MP3 files.  (Both are supposed to have some problems with computer-burned CDs however).Ultimately, though, the Panasonic RV31 is worth the extra 10 bucks.  The controls are significantly easier to use, with a jog wheel on the console and easy frame-by-frame advance and reverse.  The other reports I've seen say that the Panasonic is significantly better with scratched DVDs, which is important for renters like me."
1814,"This lens is great, and iffy at the same time.I used it on a D90 and experienced backfocus issues, and then discovered in the lens/camera compatibility charts that the AF used in this lens is not totally compatible with the ""newer AF technology"" used in the D90.  Ok, it was released in 1997, but WHY hasn't the tech been changed to adopt new cameras?It's still sold new and I blame Nikon for not making it more obvious that it will have consistency issues at widely used focal lengths.  We're talking out of focus eyes and an inch of fudge room on a lower tier body like the D90.That being said it works flawlessly on my D700, optically speaking as well as hitting focus well, but I paid $1500 for that camera, not $600.  It somehow can figure it out, but the D90 can't...and Nikon almost omits that fact except for one line of text in the user manual of the lens.  You won't see it in adverts on B&H;, Adorama, or Company A, buyer beware.  I'd check if you have any camera that isn't full frame but has a focus motor (D80, D90, D7000, D7100).  The D600, D700, D800, and D610 *SHOULD* all focus just fine and IF the D600 has a AF fine-tune, they can all fix lens calibration issues to a point.  I'm banking on the estimate that full-frame bodies will focus more accurately.  However the D600 may share focusing with the D7000 which I haven't tested on this lens.ANOTHER ISSUE:The AF/MF selector ring is a faulty design and WILL BREAK.  Google it, because it's a VERY common issue, apparently.  The fix is thankfully reportedly easy, rather than shipping it to Nikon, so if you like to DIY, don't worry too much.Basically a small ratchet activated inside the barrel when you turn the AF/MF selector ring but it is PLASTIC and easily wears and breaks.  By pulling back the larger rubber grip and un-taping the cover you can move the ratchet catch over, and reglue with stronger adhesive.  Looks like Nikon wanted an easy repair according to some reviews of the fix I've read; the part looks like it was engineered to be moved over to easily fix the issue without a new part!!Also, the ring itself on my lens has fractured and is another common problem with this lens, if it gets bad that AF/MF black ring develops a huge crack and can break pieces off.Personally I find any lens that's OVER $800 DOLLARS to be shamefully constructed if it fails like this under normal operating conditions.  The whole body is mostly metal except this part that breaks.  Failure on Nikon's part and something else I'm surprised they don't fix before continuing production.  Of course they may have stopped production a year ago, who knows.There have been something around 3 models to supersede this one and yet Nikon still neglects to update the design.  It's a great inexpensive 2.8 zoom, but be prepared for some minor repairs on it and watch out for compatibility on less than pro level bodies.So far my like-new copy (when purchased used) has not failed it's main use, but has no Manual Focus because of the ratchet failing and has a hairline crack in the AF/MF ring just as many report.Save your money if you can, get the VRII version, or consider the VRI copy which may have it's own shortcomings, I'm not sure.  Or if you can pick this up for $500 like I did, go for it and don't look back.  You don't need VR in many cases anyway and you can buy something else with your $500 you saved and earn money with photography to upgrade later.  That's what I'm doing.If you save or sell your current crop body you can get a nice D610 with the added cash you save buying one of these used.I do recommend the lens to those that know what they are doing, but warn individuals who aren't up for troubleshooting.  I knocked one star for Nikon failing to address the compatibility issue more, and another because the crappy AF/MF switch that is truly a sad thing on a nice lens like this!"
1815,"I brought this memory on the recommendation of Reviewer: R. Geissman ""rlgeissman"" (Lodi, OH United States).  I have an E-machine T1300 1.3 GHz Celeron system that is a step up from the E-machine T1220 and the memory only reads at half the capacity. Instead of the chip reading 256mb it only shows 128mb. I had used the PNY Configurator that indicated that I should use 256S100 but R. Geissman recommendation was too strong to pass up.  Well, I must say a lesson learned.  No hard feelings R. Geissman.  I'm going to order the PNY 256S100 and see will it do the trick.  I hope this review helps someone who has an E-machine of this model."
1816,"The Riot seems to be very well made, and it has worked flawlessly for me for three weeks.  It replaces a 6 Gigabyte Nomad Jukebox.  Compared to the Nomad, the Riot is more convenient to operate (the jogwheel is nice, and much quicker than Nomad's buttons), has a better display (bigger font than Nomad) and a mostly better file management system and both loads and turns off much more quickly (a big plus).  The included FM radio is a big improvement over the Nomad, which has no radio.  The 20GB drive is a huge improvement over the 6GB on the Nomad or the I-pod (though Creative now offers a 20GB Nomad with similar capacity). I like the case (which has a belt clip, and permits access to the controls) and, unlike other reviewers, I am not especially bothered either by the Riot's size (bigger than I-pod but on a par with Nomad and Archos) or by its use of USB 1.0 instead of much faster Firewire.  Sound quality is as good as the Nomad (which is fine), and the player may play just a little bit louder (which is better).  Unlike the Nomad, this player doesn't record, and lacks a separate line out jack for use with a home stereo (though I think you can use the headphone jack as an output jack with the proper cabling).Two big gripes:  The software on the player does not permit you to create a &quot;single use&quot; playlist of songs by various artists.  If you want to turn the player on and listen to songs from multiple artists, you need to create such a list, you need to name and save it, before you can play it, and I find this a frustrating timewaster.  My second (and bigger) gripe concerns the battery: it is built-in and not user replaceable, so you can't carry a spare battery as you can with the Nomad.  The fully charged battery powers only about 1/2 of the ten hours of use its supposed to provide, which might not be enough for some users. Finally, the player comes with multiple warnings against (1) recharging the battery before it is fully drained, or (ii) leaving the player plugged into the charger after it is fully charged.  Because the battery status display also is not very finely calibrated, I feel that I need to pay way too much attention to battery charge status.  This can add up to a big problem if I know that I will want to use the player for several hours on a given day.  For that much use, I need to start the day with a fully charged battery.  To do that, given Rio's warnings, I must remember to leave the player on all evening the day before, to make sure the battery is fully drained and ready to charge so that I can plug the unit in at bedtime, then get up in the middle of the night to unplug the unit and guard against overcharging.The Real Jukebox software that you load on your pc for use with this player seems inferior to the Musicmatch based software that ships with the Nomad Jukebox, especially for organizing files and editing mp3 tags.  I don't know whether you can effectively substitute either Musicmatch or Windows Media Player, but its worth investigating.  I know that you can not use Windows Explorer to move files back and forth from the Riot to your PC, as I believe you can with the Archos.So, all in all, I'm glad I bought the Riot instead of the 20 GB Nomad.  But only a little bit."
1817,"I was a Sharp Wizard user, so I was excited when they came out with a more sophisticated PDA.  I was swayed by the price and the pull out keyboard unit.  Since I purchased it in November 2003, I have not been able to sync anything but the address book and calendar.  This is a waste to me.  After several e-mails and phone calls to Sharp, I am considering chalking this up to a bad experience, and jumping out of the Sharp bandwagon and purchasing a Palm or IPAQ.  I am truly disappointed with this product and pray that you do not make the same mistake."
1818,"Just got these, and don't really care for them. They sound OK, and I guess you get what you pay for. They sound a little boxy and heavy on the low end to me. Certainly usable though....not a bad sound."
1819,"I gave this S2 to my mom for Mother's Day. After a few weeks, the very fine speaker wire that runs inside of the headband somehow became unsecured and exposed. It was then accidentally pulled as my mother removed it one day and the fine wire tore, rendering the unit unplayable.It has been almost impossible contacting Sony for repair. When I finally reached them, the repair costs for this small repair were unwarranted and I ended up purchasing a new unit at a discount outlet. Sony is engineering is good but their service is terrible. This is not a good prospect for a consumer in the long run."
1820,"I like it because people on the bus do not pick on my stuff... kind of annoying. But the way it holds on your screen is not the best, and a little bit messy. Some time it come off. But still like it...."
1821,"The surge protector is Ok. My complaint is that you have to be Superman to plug your device into the outlet. I am a big guy, but with this protector I feel like Olive Oyl."
1822,"I don't use it much but it does allow me to use the extra lenses that went with a much larger SLR camera.Worth buying if you need to use a larger lens than is on the camera.Mine is an Olympus Camedia C 765 Ultra Zoom, an older one with 10 X zoom. I love it. Birds in tree tops look like they are 10 feet away.Annie"
1823,"Easy to install in a dual G5 Power Mac, no drivers required. The card works fine with OS 10.4.8, but the computer will not go into Sleep Mode if a disk drive is connected to this card (including iPods). The drives will sleep, but not the Mac. The computer will sleep fine if my scanner, card reader (without card) and IR remote are plugged into this card. Also, if you plug your keyboard into the card, you can't wake the computer because the card is ""sleeping"". I checked the ADS website and there are no fixes for the sleep issues. If you can work around the quirks, the card does work."
1824,"It keeps the CPU cool enough but I was hoping for quieter. I will make some bios adjustments on the next reboot. If it improves, then I will update this review and add a star."
1825,"Mouse has performed reasonably well.  Had some issues where the hard to get a signal from the transmitter at some distances, if you're looking for a device to control you multimedia center, you might want to look at the newer thumball model, it has better range.  I actually used to like this for a while, however I began noticing my pinkie finger getting numb after using the mouse for long periods of time.  Finally realized that it takes so much pressure to push the left click button, that I had to use my pinkie to stabilize the mouse(or put a lot of downpressure with my palm) to keep the mouse from sliding.So the biggest problem is range and takes too much pressureT to click the left click.  Other than those two issues, it's a pretty nice trackball.BTW, I still use this mouse, but have moved onto the newer thumb based trackball.  Never thought I'd get used to it, but now that I have I actually like it.I still use this model on some other pc's around the house.  I think it's fine for ""light"" use, but extended use will likely cause a problem, at least for me it did."
1826,"As others say, the device is small and easy on the eyes.  I express caution with regard to critical purposes such as servers and IP telephony; we have experienced some weird problems with this.  We have three (Netgear FS608 v2) in two locations; two connected to a 24 port Midnight switch and the third I think connects to a Cisco 3524.  They may intermittently refuse to forward frames from just one source to just one destination while allowing frames from that same source to other destination, weird stuff like that.  Reset takes a power cycle OR just unplug the uplink cable and reconnect.  It's a real nuisance if it means you have to drive to work on a weekend or an IP telephone call goes &quot;blip&quot; into la-la land.  I'm sure they have a limitation on the size of the MAC address cache but I have not so far researched it.  &lt;b&gt;Beware using little switches on big networks!&lt;/b&gt; (That sounds like a grade b movie title!)"
1827,"Like most others who wrote reviews, I was attracted to the price of this unit and the ability to have a router and wireless access point in one unit. I should also mention I chose this router because it explicitly supports Macintosh computers (including AppleTalk) and its setup is web-based.Ironically, the setup with my Powerbook using Airport was painless, and I've not had a single problem with it. I love the web-based administration, and the range of functions you have (MAC control, WEP, SPI, Firewall, etc.). The biggest hassles I have had with this router revolve around its DHCP server and getting it to communicate with my wife's Sony Vaio with a D-Link DWL-650+ card. So far, I've had no luck even using static IP.I've not needed to reset this box like some others. Your mileage may vary.Tech support is based in India. Very polite, but they follow a script pretty rigorously and I haven't been referred to a higher level technician despite repeated calls.Bottom line - an OK unit. I suspect there are better ones out there, but for now, it fits the bill."
1828,"I bought this to replace the wireless keyboard that came with my iMac in hopes That I would have easier access to USB ports (on the side of the keyboard) and would be able to load my Bootcamp partition easier (since it requires a USB keyboard to do the startup choices).Every part of my experience with this keyboard has been disappointing.  It started with the shipping where it was 'being prepared' for 3 days before actually being shipped.  When I received it, the drivers on the CD did not fully function for Mac OSX 10.6.4 (the basic keyboard worked, but the function keys and eject buttons did not).  Downloading the new driver from the website fixed that (but that was not straightforward since the Macally website no longer lists the ICEKEY as a product).Then there is the height of the keyboard.  The front edge is 3/8"" taller then that of an Apple keyboard.  If you use the foldout feet to put it at more of an angle (which I have done with every other keyboard that I have had, it becomes to tall and steep for me to comfortably use.  Using it without the rear feet takes some adjustment, too since the keyboard is taller, but flatter than what I consider a normal keyboard.This morning I tried plugging in a USB flashdrive in the USB port on the side on the keyboard.  The port did not have enough power to run the flashdrive.  I tested a few other devices and a few other flash drives did work, but other flash drives and USB powered devices that I have used via the side USB ports on an actual Apple keyboard did not work with the Macally.If I had to do this again, I would not buy this keyboard."
1829,I expected better from Targus. Doesn't really cool the laptop that well.
1830,"This lens has a very useful focal range, is fairly compact, has a decent minimum focus distance, and has image stabilization. Everything you would want in a good walk-around lens, basically. Unfortunately it just didn't sing for me. I wanted it to be better than it is... I guess it's because I'm spoiled by owning some L glass and great third-party lenses like theTamron SP 24-70mm Di VC USD Canon Mount AFA007C-700.I do a lot of product photography, and in the small space that is my home studio I'm constantly running up against the minimum focus distance on the Canon 70-200mm lenses. The Tamron 24-70mm works well enough, but sometimes 70m isn't quite long enough to get the perspective that I'm after. I can switch to prime lenses, such as the Canon 100mm macro, however I thought that this lens would be a good all-around compromise, since it covers more focal range on the long end and focuses pretty close. Not quite close enough, I'm afraid. It has a little section at the end labeled ""macro"", but that's a joke. The closest focusing distance is approximately 19.2 inches (50cm) and the Max. magnification is a mere 0.19x. My Tamron 24-70mm, on the other hand, focuses as close as 15 inches (38cm) and has a Max. magnification ratio of 0.2x even though it is not labeled ""macro"". The Canon 28-135mm didn't gain me any ground in the area of close focus while giving up a considerable amount of image quality.Speaking of image quality, it is only moderately good and when you're used to shooting with high quality glass it's a disappointment. The image stabilization is an earlier generation and so it's not as effective as today's IS. I just couldn't see myself accepting the drop in quality to gain the additional focal range. You can see that this lens doesn't really hold its value as the resale price for used is considerably less than the price for new. It's currently selling used for only about 60% of the new cost. Compare this to most L lenses which hold their resale value much better, usually demanding 90% or more of the new price. On the upside, you can easily pick one of these up for around $250 here or on the 'bay and try it out if you like with minimal risk.Released in 1998, this is now showing its age. This, or something like it, would be a great candidate for a Canon remake. I hope they consider it because there are not any other full frame lenses to choose from that cover this particular range. There is an EF-S lens with a very similar field of view range, theCanon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM UD Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameraswhich is an exceptionally good lens. If you're shooting on a crop body, definitely skip this lens and get that one. If you're shooting full frame, save up for the Tamron 24-70mm or the Canon 24-105mm f/4.Happy Shooting!"
1831,"listen it does its jobThis universal remote control works perfect, the way you input the code for your tv or device is very very simple and that is great.If you wrongly press another button like VCR you just press TV and it works again, what I mean is that it does not get misconfigured like others universal controls that I have had in the past. so baisically no qualms"
1832,"Not much of a base sound, and there are a lot of other brands out there for a lower price that I believe gives the same quality. Still it is a good loudspeaker."
1833,"As others have stated, this lens will yield very nice, sharp images. If you buy it, make sure you also get a lens hood for outdoor shooting; otherwise, expect all of your pictures to have lens flares.Unfortunately, I dropped my lens less than 2 weeks after receiving it. The drop was only 2 feet onto not-so-plush carpeting; but, it was enough force to crack the casing in half. It is a bit sad that the glass on this lens is stronger than the plastic casing ""protecting"" it. Fortunately, American Express' insurance company is covering the damage. I definitely recommend buying this with a credit card so you too can get that 90 day coverage. More so, I recommend finding something a bit more sturdy even if it is a bit more expensive."
1834,"I enjoyed the lens, but I decided to return it and upgrade to the 50mm f1.4 which is the lens I always use. I am glad that I decided to upgrade to the better one."
1835,"I have used this lens as an inexpensive alternative to a good zoom, but it really gives marginal increase in width plus distorts the edges and at the widest angle blocks the corners view.Item came in on time and in brand new condition."
1836,"Yeah the remote is useful specially when you have set up the shot and have to move from behind the camera to fix something. However the limitation is the sensor on the camera. A cable is probably a better option. Regardless it is a good piece of equipment and I do use it. I like it fine, but I'm not crazy about it. Just another piece of equipment to use when necessary."
1837,"Once you set up your camera for remote, make sure you dont go back and try to take a shot using the camera button, it takes it out of remote mode (D80).  Why cant they both work in unison?  I dont know.  Aside from that small issue, works as expected, first press is focus, second is shutter.  They could have implemented a two stage button to have some sort of consistancy, but they chose to keep the remote slim."
1838,"I don't know if the short is in the cordless phone or the headphone, they both are new.  They work beautifully but then we have the short, which happened fairly quickly.  A matter of months."
1839,"Larger, heavier, and stiffer than expected, this will give you 4 heavy duty plugs and free up three, but don't expect to tuck into tight spaces like you would a light-duty 3-way lamp extension cord. It's good to get your wall-warts off your plug strip and free up those otherwise covered plugs, but the size of it, it belongs on the end of a #14 extension cord for power tools in your workshop or garage.It's a good heavy-duty 4-way splitter, but it's just a bit too bulky for your computer desk or entertainment stack. They should make an 18-gauge one about 9 inches long just for wall-warts."
1840,The product worked but dial up is REALLY bad.  Get a USB stick from verizon or some place and get high-speed internet.
1841,"Had this Router for about a year and it worked well. Setup was easy and it worked well with Xbox Live etc (had Open NAT which is important for some services). Routers are still not as easy to admin as they should be but the interface was decent.Unfortunately, the little 1amp power brick failed after about 1 year. I know this was the case after doing some a/b tests with another power supply.So, reliability was the only issue but that's a big issue. I gave it 3 stars because I may have just got a bad PS. Its also unfortunate that they (Netgear) does not seem to provide replacment parts for the router (at least I could not find a it) and if you go through normal retail channels it will cost you somewhere between $10 and $30 to get a replacement power supply."
1842,"This was a present that I didn't even see. It was sent directly to my friend.  She loves it and thanks me everytime she sees me.  So, I would say that it's great."
1843,"I do understand that they work great for some people, but for whatever reason I am unable to insert them into my ear canal such that they become closed ear with the resulting superior bass and blocking of outside noise.My other complaint is that as you walk, the cord moves around and you hear a thumping in your ears.I find that I like the inexpensive $10 Sony earbuds that rest outside your ear canals a lot better. They are much more comfortable for me.At least they didn't cost too much. I'd sure be mad if I spent $100 on headphones that I didn't like."
1844,I have been using these for quite some time and no problems.The replaceable ear plugs are a good idea but sometimes they do come off. I had to replace the ones that fit my ear because I lost one of them and they come in a pair for a smaller size that also came with the hphones. 3 sizes come with the hphones.Also these are to be used exclusively with a music player that goes in your waist or arm because of the lenght on each side of the ear plugs. It is longer on one side. If you plan to use it for a threadmill or gym machine I dont recommend it. Your will not be comfortable and sometomes you will unplug yourself from the machine because of the size in lenght.So far that is the only downside.
1845,"I bought this targus mice for $10 but it is full of flaws. Opening battery latch is a terrible experience and this mouse goes to dormant now and then. Synchronizing is again a pain, each time you have to press infinitesimally small button in mouse and sometimes it take a while and may be frustating.Over all mouse size is also small and it dosnt fit nicely inside palm.My earlier logitech mouse was much much better in operation just a little heavy but one can ignore that factor.My good advice dont buy this mouse (even if it is for free) if want peace of mind."
1846,"I just got this in the mail about 1 hr ago. I haven't had time to fully test this mic, but I felt compelled to write a review. I was nervous before I got it after reading the reviews of people claiming the mic doesn't work on Windows 7 64 bit.I unboxed it, plugged it in and opened the windows recorder. It didn't feel like it worked. I then went to the device manager in control panel. The mic was listed there and selected as default device. I disabled the built in mic, selected this mic and clicked on the levels tab. The levels were all the way down for the mic. I increased them and voila, it worked fine. I recorded a short clip testing it and played it back just fine. This tells me that people claiming that the mic doesn't work with windows 7 haven't even tried to get it to work. The mic works just fine via plug and play.My first impression about the sound is that it's a bit quieter than what I expected. I will test it some more though and update this review. I am also planning to test this under Linux, even though I suspect that it will work just fine.I am giving it 3 stars for now, because the sound was crisp, but a bit quiet, though not too quiet."
1847,"I run Windows 7 64-bit. The software stinks. I use it without the software.I love the scroll ring and that it has a right mouse button. Some applications require these. Though, the scroll ring moves a little rough, and when you scroll, it goes rather slowly. Also, when you press a button, the clicks are very loud.And why did they get rid of the extra buttons on the top with this newer model? Those are selling used for like $400 now. Why did they get rid of that?The price is too high. It's made out of plastic. Come on. Keyboards have more plastic and parts and cost less.Note: I had to plug the mouse into a high-powered USB in the back of the computer because it wouldn't recognize it in the USB hub."
1848,"This lens about doubles the telephoto magnification of an Olympus zoom lens digital camera.  However, that isn't a lot of gain considering the cost of this item and the required adapter rings, plus the hassle of putting this lens on and taking it off.  It does provide a bit more mileage out of your Olympus zoom camera and would be a good buy at about half the price."
1849,"I was stupid buying this to use with my DSLR.  While it works..  attaching the camera to the head is a pain in the butt as it is designed primarily for narrow long camcorder form factors instead of wide DSLRs.What this means is the lever to tighten the plate to the head goes about half a turn and hits the bottom of the camera.You have to then pull the lever, rotate the the lever half a turn and start tightening it again to the plate. On a narrow camcorder..it is not an issue as the tightening lever is unobstructed.Other than that complaint, the head is nice!"
1850,"The following equipment will fit into the main compartment:- one Canon 5D body with attached Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM and lens hood- one Canon XT body with attached Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM and reversed lens hoodThe following equipment will fit into the outer compartment:- one Canon Speedlite 580EX and smaller necessitiesWith the bag rotated towards the front of my 6 foot 185 pound frame, there's always this fear of dropping a camera while struggling to remove it from the main compartment.Instead, I have to unbuckle the waist belt, remove the bag from my body in order to easily remove a camera from the compartment.  A slow process which defeats the purpose of this so-called ""Velocity"" design.I returned the bag for a full refund and am still waiting for the right sling bag."
1851,"These are not great binoculars but they are good for the price. I despise the plastic case, the thin plastic neckstrap and the plastic lens caps, what would it cost to make it a bit more sturdy, a dollar or two? And what is your first impression of the bino's, cheap carrying case then a strap that would look too small on a pocket camera?The clarity of view is fairly good, and the field of view is good for 10x binoculars. They feel sturdy and they are ergonomically well set up. They have a rubbery texture that is good when it is raining or you are in fog. The low light performance was ok, I was able to spot deer at dawn in fairly heavy cover. All in all, I got what I paid for and a little more."
1852,"I bought a 40"" reflector and needed a holder to keep it angled to the subject. The light stand attachment was a little awkward at first but i guess it caters for every possible size to make it universal. Attaching the reflector takes a little getting used too due to the size. I recommend when selecting this holder to not exceed the 32"" reflector size or have a very sturdy light stand. It can tip over without weighing down the light stand. If you have the $$$ to spare go for the boom with reflector attachment and counter weight. Much more usefull in a studio setup. As for portability yes it will do if you have a small to medium reflector."
1853,Great glass BUT it cannot accommodate a lens cap - so keep a hood on (hard if you have large fingers and are using the Canon) or run the risk of scratching it.
1854,"I keep my logitech mouse at work, however the model I bought is about 3 years old now. I've been using it faithfully since I bought it. But when I went to buy a new mouse for home, I found that the Logitech was no longer being made. The new mouse is longer, lower, and lighter. So while I'm very happy with the Logitech, I got the kensington because it most resembled the mouse I have.The kensington is okay. It sets up easily enough, and the software that comes with it is marginally useful.The real gripe I have with this mouse is that the control of the wheel is not very good. Scrolling with it is jerky at best. With the logitech, it is very smooth. So I actually find myself using the scroll bars and not using the scroll wheel at all. For being a scroll mouse, that's pretty sad.However, I bought the mouse for home for one reason: To play Unreal Tournament 2004. My ""home"" computer is a laptop, and playing FPS games is absolutely impossible on a trackpad. So, for the game, the mouse is more than adequate. Its tracking is smoothe, the movement on my mousepad is fine, and it is even fairly comfortable. It has enough buttons, and is well supported by the game.I just would not recommend it for anything other than casual use or gaming. The wheel is a real hindrance, and the quality just feels poor in comparison to my Logitech."
1855,"For a 50&#34; cable, I expected heavier gauge wire and some beefier insulation. If they had used the same grade cable for the video (yellow) as for the audio (red/white) it would be perfect.For such a long run though, it's nearly impossible not to pick up interference, ground loop issues, etc on the audio cables.I had to add a line filter, which cleared up the issue drastically. I had one laying around already I could use, but if I hadn't, the added cost would have negated any savings from the cheaper cable."
1856,"I use this to control my laptop and desktop pc.  I am constantly having to crawl under my desk to press the buttons to switch computers as the hot buttons do not work if only one computer is on.  It will remember the last computer used.  If you start up the other, you will need to press the button on the unit.  It will not automatically switch to the one that is powered or powering up."
1857,I had one of these fans for about 8 years and it finally stopped working.  It had a USB port with it so when you plugged the fan in to a USB port you didn't lose the use of one on you laptop.  I was disappointed when I received the new fan to find that this one does not have the USB port so you do lose one port on the laptop.  I still love the fan itself and can only hope this one lasts as long.
1858,If i remember correctly i got this for free through a promotion or very cheapI would say this product would be okay if it were for your laptop that you always just left at the deskif not and you always put your laptop on your lap or bed then this isnt so goodthe reason i say so is that the connector that connects the usb cord to the cooler wears out easy and then its useless
1859,"Do not use this product if you have a heavy duty cord being reeled in. For the most part, it did it's job and the cord is now out of the way in the garage."
1860,"The B+W clear uv haze filter is one of the best you can buy, I am definitely happy with my purchase even though it was delivered with scuff marks around the rim of the filter.  Company A credited me for the damage."
1861,"I bought this bag to replace a 15'' Targus backpack I have been using for 8 years.  I have been carrying a 17'' laptop in this 15'' bag for the last 3 years.  After 8 years, it still works flawlessly.  I might replace the laptop with a bigger one, so I bought this bag for the large size.CONS:I now have two Targus bags, so I am able compare the quality between them.  This new 17'' bag is thinner and has an inferior nylon feel when compared to my 8 year old Targus bag.There is no padding at the bottom.PROS:The large size can fit the biggest laptops made today.  It can also be used to carry camping/hiking gears.Buy it if you have an over-sized laptop.  If you have a standard size 17'' laptop, there are better choices."
1862,"This mounting bracket works well, but pay attention to the Garmin GPS you intend to use it for as there are variations for  several models. For example, this unit fits the Foretrex 201 but not the 101.  Company A do carry the different types so take care to read the info to find the model you want.  Other than that, it does what it is meant to do; providing a good easy way to mount your GPS to a handlebar.  Works well."
1863,"Positives: Tungsten E has been a zippy and durable PDA in my use over the last 2 years.  The screen resolution is excellent and the processor speed is more than adequate.  I never cared for wireless connection, so to me it was not an issue.Negatives: the screen makes an audible and very annoying high pitched noise (if you read blogs over the internet, it is a pervasive and highly annoying problem -- one that Palm has been unwilling or unable to address).  I guess this is what you get when your electronics are made in China;The onboard memory of 32 Mb is frankly inadequate for 2007; installation of applications to memory card dramatically slows their access speed"
1864,"I bought this to replace a LineX transmitter that has only 7 frequency settings, none of which are very usable in my area.  We use it to broadcast audio from our Audiotron to radios in and around our house.  The LineX has a good range for this use, 75-100 feet or so.When I got the Crane, I loaded batteries into it, plugged it into the Audiotron, and turned it on.  Using a portable FM receiver I found the range to be *3* (yes, THREE) feet.  Using the AC adaptor did not expand the range, nor did adjusting either of the transmitter and receiver antennas, nor did adjusting the input levels.So, I popped the box open and set the variable resister as other reviewers have noted.  After this change I got a range closer to that of the LineX.NOTE THAT THIS MODIFICATION VOIDS THE CRANE WARRANTY!  Page 11 of the manual: ""Removing the cover ... will void the warranty.""  The bean counters at Crane must be very happy about this; ship a product that can only be used by voiding the warranty, and you eliminate any returns.  To be fair, there are no seals on the Crane, so you could pretend that you never opened it, but it's still pretty sleazy.The Crane's input levels are touchy.  I had to tweak the Audiotron output and Crane input levels many times to get a clean signal on our receivers.The frequency display is LCD, with no backlighting.  Depending on available light and the viewing angle, it's not as easy to read as the marketing materials would have you believe.  For a static installation such as mine this is OK - find a good channel and forget it.  For use on the go this could get annoying.The ability to set a frequency between FM channels is very useful in avoiding interference from radio stations, and that's what I've done.  NOTE: your FM receivers must be capable of tuning ""off channel"" for this to work for you.Another reviewer notes that the antenna on the Crane is too short for the frequencies involved.  The length was obviously chosen so it would fit the cover when collapsed, not for efficient transmission.  I considered replacing the antenna, but the Crane is not built to easily allow it and I didn't want to push the warranty issue too much further.On the Crane box is a quote from John O'Brien, Wired Magazine, who says ""The Crane is tops... easy-to-read... great audio... variety of power sources... wide range of frequency...""  I find it telling that there's no mention about the range of the Crane, so I looked up the review on the web (Google ""crane transmitter wired magazine review"").  The review says ""30 feet across an apartment to a radio in another room"", but doesn't say that he actually tried it.  I don't know what product he was reviewing, but it certainly wasn't this one.Pros:-- Acceptable range after making the hardware mod.-- Acceptable audio quality after repeated levels tweaking.-- Ability to tune off-channel.-- LCD frequency display.  (The LineX uses DIP switches and has no display.  The LineX is also $30 cheaper.)-- Audio splitter cable included, which was exactly what I needed for my set up.-- AC adapter.  (The LineX used only batteries, and they would last about a week at 24x7.)Cons:-- You have to void the warranty to make it usable.-- Touchy levels control.-- LCD display hard to read in less-than-optimal light and viewing angle.This could have been a great product, but it's only mediocre."
1865,"I only wish the mechanical action was smoother - it seems like the build quality is only mediocre, or maybe my finger muscle control is just weak.  I kept correcting back and forth on the zoom lever/button to get focal points where I wanted.  Images are clear and care should be used with the lenses, as with any optical device.  Great that it comes with a case.It's an okay buy for the price, I guess.  I do like the compact size.  I would recommend something with a bit more professional `feel' to it if you don't mind spending a few more dollars.  Most things depend on what you want to do with them - I just like optics."
1866,"Not the best head set system, but functional.  Bought several for the call center at my office.  1 in 4 didn't work and I had to send back for replacements.  The ones that do work have been going strong for 2 yrs.  The over the head band looks terrible but is the most comfortable.  The over the ear piece has broken on several of them."
1867,"I purchased my bicycle mount for my GPSMAP60CSX about a year ago and have used it numerous times. Most of the use has been on roads or fairly smooth trails. I have done some fairly rough mountain biking with this mount on 2 occasions. I did manage to break the very top of the mount (the hole where the round button on the back of the GPS unit fits) when my knee knocked the unit. I think the area at the top of the GPS cradle could be strengthened if Garmin decided to redesign this product. I can still use the mount but the GPS will come out when I hit large bumps in the trail (road riding is not a problem). I would recommend looping the wrist strap around your handle bars as a safety at all times to avoid loss or damage of your very expensive GPS unit. For mountain biking use I think this product is certainly worth the $20. For casual riding with a mountain bike you should have no problems. As mentioned by another reviewer, this is not compatible with a road bike (at least not mine). I have a Cannondale Synapse and this mount will not fit around my handlebars. I am still looking for a way to use my Garmin with my road bike."
1868,"I just unpacked my TRV-460 and charged the FM-30 battery, which comes with the camcorder.  After setting the date and shooting for about 7 minutes, the battery was dead.  When reading the manual, Sony doesn't even recomend the FM-30; but, they ship it anyway.  When I replaced the battery with an off-brand FM-50, sold by a well known retail store, the camcorder powered up and gave a message that it wasn't a Sony battery and then powered down and didn't work.  Appears Sony wants to only sell their batteries.  Someone there must still be remembering Hiroshima or something.  The camera is good.  The accesories are high priced and what is shipped is inadequate to say the least."
1869,"I was really excited to open the box and get this set up.  Through a week of use I have found that it consistently gets static, no matter where I put it in my car. Additionally, it's kind of a pain to keep switching stations when you are in a populated metro area that has a lot of radio traffic. The idea in theory is excellent, I wonder if it can be perfected a bit more though."
1870,"Look, these headphones have some nice features and some not so nice features.  I'll list them out for you, you make up your own mind.Positive features-Charging system- could not be easier.  Put headphones onto cradle.  Done.Reception - at first I was getting lots of interference, I had to change the baby monitor to channel B, now they are crystal clear.  I sit 4 feet from a Wireless access point in my office and there isn't any issue.Sound quality - they sound really good. Not spectaular, but good.Sound Volume - no issues for me here, I have them plugged into a home theater amp and the is plenty of volume left to be raised.Negative features-Comfort - the foam ear pieces are completly flat... not cupped like my Sennheiser HD590.  They sit ON your ear, not around them.Base Auto Shutoff-  Shuts the base off after a few minutes of no sound.Regarding this last point... this maybe would make sense if the headphones themselves shut off if no audio was detected for 3 minutes.  In this situation, the BASE shuts off, leaving the headphones to happily drain battery life.  Why ?  and Why such a short time period?  Are we saving THAT much power?  Could they have let the base sit.. maybe 5 minutes? 10 even?  Enough time to grab a drink of water or something?  I don't know about you, but for me, the beauty of watching TV and movies at home is the simple fact that I CAN pause, take a break, check on the kids, answer an e-mail, then go back to the entertainment.  But leave these alone for 3 minutes and you'll return to the lovely HISSS of the base shutting off while the headphones are still on.  Then it takes a few seconds once pressing play, to get sound again.  So now you have to rewind a few seconds, or just miss some dialogue.  Stupid stupid auto shutoff feature."
1871,"A quarter of a century ago I bought a pair of Nikon Action binoculars that produced a simply stunning image - bright, contrasty, sharp.  I was hoping for the same from a new pair of RC-1s, but that was not to be the case - I would describe the image as adequate, but not stunning.  The great advantage of these is that they are small and light.  But if you want the kind of image a full sized pair of field binoculars can produce, you'll have to put up with their weight and size, because these don't do it.  Why Consumer Reports has been so enthusiastic about them is a mystery to me, but they tested a whole bunch of them - maybe this is the best of the lot."
1872,Kind of liked the radio as it was simple and straight forward. Only after two weeks of trying on and off I could never get it to alarm on the SAME feature.  Would work fine as a weather radio. Think mine was just a bad one and am going to return and order the WR-300.
1873,"Disappointing.  Frequent outages and sudden weaknesses in signal strength inside the house, and this occurs with two different laptops with two different brands of wireless cards.  This is very hard to troubleshoot; nothing to be done but send this D-Link router back and get another brand, I guess."
1874,"If you're involved in the pursuit of the Ultimate Budget Video Cable, this Belkin won't be the last stop in your journey. It's only average performance, with a suprisingly soft image despite the use of solid-core wire (I find this to be characteristic of Belkin's entire line of video cable). Contrast is low, which gave the tv image a flat, slightly pale look; tv picture controls can accomplish only so much, which was not enough to make this cable's image look any more spiffy. The connectors are a bit loose, so that swiveling your tv side to side often drops a connection or two. One owner's advice to slightly crimp the plug's edges is really NOT what you should be forced to do, but it's likely the only method for keeping these critters secured. Reviews of this wire from other buyers are as puzzling as ever, especially those stating that this wire is ""better"" than such-and-such brand or ""can't see"" any difference between this product and their old Monster Cable (admittedly the Monsters are awful, but they do have decent contrast). I don't know what kind of alien-planet tv some people are watching, but if you can't detect a major difference between these and the few really good (and many bad) budget video cables around, it doesn't make any difference whether you buy $500 dream-wire, $4 super-cheapies, or these Belkins. The gold plating is no help; everyone reading this knows that gold isn't used in pro video shops because of its poor conductivity. Anyway, how much gold can you get at this price? Nickel-copper alloy would make more sense. In this case the price is about right for this level of performance. The search goes on!"
1875,"I purchased this device to record our favorite morning show for my girlfriend, who spends all of her prime listening time underground in the Metro.  She gets it a day late now, but much better than nothing, so in terms of pure functionality, this device works fine.  Some people have complained about the radio reception; I may not be in a position to judge, because I live just outside Washington, D.C. and we have lots of high-powered transmitters all over the place here, but I don't have any trouble listening to any of my favorite stations.  Even the low-power public/university stations come in fine -- at least the ones that I can get on my other radios.The problem, however, is the software.  Please note, I have only used this with Windows XP (though from reading the instructions, OS X functionality is only minimally better).  Griffin did its customers a grave disservice by only allowing recording to .wav format.  Known for their Mac accessories, Griffin is careful to make their interfaces simple, but they've unfortunately taken the restrictive, rather than elegant approach to simplicity.The software is very restrictive: it allows the user only to change radio stations, pause and rewind (haven't tested this functionality), set favrote stations (presets), and schedule recordings.It does NOT allow you to name the scheduled recordings (the original software did, but since I updated, everything is named ""Radio recordings.wav"".It does not allow you to choose a recording format, or add additional codecs or other plugins.  I understand not wanting to pay for a commercial .mp3 codec license for each device sold, but at LEAST let me set the sample rate of the .wav - I don't really need 44.1 KHz for a morning show.  I fully expected to be able to add my own codecs, such as .mp3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, etc. but no, you are 100% locked into 44.1KHz 1400kbps pcm .wav files.Which brings me to the next problem - no automation.  You can not tell it to automatically execute any commands after recording a file.  This means I can't even automate the .mp3 conversion with my own encoding software, and would have to go through Windows scheduling to do so.Bottom line: if you need a USB FM receiver/recorder, the Griffin Radio Shark works.  That's the best I can say about it."
1876,"The sound on the tuner died after about 2 months.  Took three weeks to fix (at least it was under warranty).  Perhaps this was an isolated incident, or perhaps their quality control is lacking.  Anyway, you're on hold for a long time getting in touch with support (I gave up after 40 minutes the first time I called, took about 25 minutes to finally get through the second time).The unit works quite well.  Picture and sound quality are good (i.e., lots better than VHS but not DVD) at the 1GB/hour setting.  Only records to DVD-R and DVD-RAM for removable media, not DVD-RW, so you're on the hook for more expensive rewritable media.  On screen editing isn't nearly as flexible as PC programs, but you can't expect much from a system with only a remote for input.TV Guide downloaded without a hitch on my cable system (Cablevision Digitial IO in NJ).  The programming interface is a little clunky, but loads simpler than a VCR.One gripe about playback is you can't enter a time code to skip to when watching.  You have to fast forward (you can FF up to 100x normal playback speed) to the point you want to watch, so if you manually record 3 hours of material as one big block, expect to spend a minute or two to FF to the third hour."
1877,"I really like this machine, the small format is great for carrying it everywhere, it is reasonably light and battery life is excellent. However, OS X is still rather slow sometimes, compared to Windows you often feel like trying to run in molasses... 30 Gigs are really not that much nowadays, if you have any media files, you will fill the hd in no time. The built-in modem is miserable. I get 26-28 kbps connections where the old windows PC using the same exact phone line gets around 40 regularly.This machine does not come with a wireless card, but I installed the Airport Extreme, and got another severe dissapointment. The range is simply ridiculous. You only get 4 bars if you are like 20 inches away from the base station (not feet, inches)... Try to wander further than 20 feet in clear sight, no walls or other obstacles, and you will get 1 bar, and no connectivity whatsoever. So you might as well just cave in, whip out your trusty ethernet cable, and curse the $70 you blew on Apple's ""Extreme"" ripoff."
1878,"I haven't actually been able to use this yet because I lost my toslink cable for the final 3rd connection, but potential buyers take note:This is a *passive* device. It's just dividing the light, so to say, in two.Therefore it can only function, in my understanding, as a splitter. You can split 1 source into 2 sources.As far as it appears, you cannot do the reverse and combine 2 sources into 1.Who knows what kind of craziness that would cause. You might crash the receiving device, or worse. I have no idea.With this caveat in mind, it seems fine."
1879,"GOOD: It's small, light, has a great arm band for running or workouts (hmm...looks like that's 18 bucks extra now, bought mine somewhere else when it was 200 unfortunately), excellent battery life, the sound is good, it holds 50-60 songs, FM reception is a nice plus, interface is easy to use to import songs.BAD: FM reception is marginal, the controls are maddingly difficult and not at all intuitive, much too easy to mistakenly put into record mode, icons for certain functions are impossibly small, construction feels cheap and plasticy.UGLY: Actually it's an attractive unit, albeit it's warts. (See ""BAD"")"
1880,"I'm sure this is a good product from the many reviews I've read. But for some reason it doesn't work for me. The fan, which works fine when connected to the motherboard, simply doesn't turn at all using this controller. It isn't the specific controller either as I purchased two and neither work. I'm going to hang on to them in case I need them on a new computer build I&#34;m working on. Perhaps they will work with different fans."
1881,"I bought this to hook up my laptop to one of my lcd monitors.  It worked, but the picture was very fuzzy.  Spend the money for a better cable."
1882,"The person that put my stereo in didn't use it.  So I can't give any real feedback on it?  Besides, how would you know if it works or not?  It doesn't actually do anything for the radio except give you reception.  ??"
1883,"The connector is OK, color-coding matches my JVC, but there is no pin 3 for the Honda steering wheel control.  Defeats the purpose of having a connector if you still have to splice one of the wires!  I would move a pin to that location, but there are no spares, unless I purchase another connector to extract one pin..."
1884,Expected to be able to use my HDMI out to DVI in on a monitor (or vice versa) -- Did not work well/at all. Check to make sure what you are planning will work.  The only real solution for 2560x1600 OR 2560x1440 is a Dual-DVI link cable.
1885,"Finally got this thing working after 3 hours of fighting it. Two tips:* try a different USB port. I wasn't getting the ""New Hardware Found"" like the manual said, until I tried a different port* try using the Windows configuration utility instead of the D-Link configuration utility. It just works. I couldn't get it to connect to my WPA-PSK router otherwise. So keep the ""Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings"" checkbox checked.Only 3 stars because it wasn't plug-and-play - it was plug-and-fight-for-3-hours-then-play."
1886,Had to get a RMA for the first unit as it died within one week.I have had no problems since.edit: 9/9/2012 ok this thing is crap it's been having the wifi drop out randomly on me lately have to reboot it at least 3 or 4 times a week.
1887,"This products accomplishes what it was intended to do; although, if all you have at point of source (i.e. service provider's coaxial) and at point of the receiver (i.e. your TV w/coaxial input only) is a coaxial cable connection, you will also need a RF modulator to accomplish the connection at both ends of the system.  While I was able to make the system function adequately with these modulators, the expense of two additional pieces of equipment made it impractical from a cost perspective.  Also, the additional boxes in a confined space (i.e. kitchen countertop) were not desirable. Also, a RF remote is needed (unless you also buy the remote extender) if you desire to view the TV to determine a desired channel.Coaxial ""in"" on the transitter and a coaxial ""out"" on the receiver would make this product more desirable."
1888,For such a low price this tiny 9 multiband radio works fine. Needs to be outside for better reception. Easy to use.
1889,"For the price, it was a good deal. But it seemed like every couple CD's I used wouldnt work. I use these for pictures, but it sucks when they wont burn onto the CD, or if they did burn my clients couldnt open them. Some of them were fine, but a good 1/3 of them didnt work."
1890,"I had a little slipping at first, but if you can get a real tight squeeze the speakers seem to stay put even when I crank the music up pretty loud. Fairly easy to install.If I re-arrange my set-up, I will probably choose something else next time that is of a little more quality. But all in all, no complaints here."
1891,"For the price yes it OK, it took a while to break in. I like it just not amazing base i used to. Buy if your not a bass nut, it a good sounding bass."
1892,I eagerly hooked it up to my Home Theatre system but discovered it just made a buzzzzzing sound. So I called Company A and they arranged return labels and I returned it immediately through UPS.  I think I have received credit but I have not checked lately.  My wife found it to be too bulky and ugly for our family room!
1893,This adapter works fine and the price was reasonable but it is less stable than I would like. You can not jiggle this cable because it will unseat
1894,"I purchased this mouse in 2006, so I've had plenty of time to play with it.  I at first thought it was comfortable, but have since changed my mind.  The wheel is too far up the mouse, so you have to move your hand up in order to use it.  Also, shortly after I got it, said wheel lost its click-sensitivity, so I now have to press very hard in order for the wheel click to register.  Not so good if you want to stay away from repetitive stress injuries.Finally, the laser's sensitivity is surprisingly inaccurate for finer movements, but works well for just dragging your cursor around.The rechargeable battery life is quite decent, and the wireless range seems to be pretty good.But all in all, I think it would be far better for people with small hands."
1895,"I bought this system to replace my Klipsch 4.1 system and the first thing I noticed was the ENORMOUS subwoofer. Great, it should have house shaking bass. I was so wrong! The sub on the Klipsch system was roughly half the size of this one and managed to knock things off the walls. My next issue was that the speakers do not have tweeters, just large mid range speakers. Logitech claims these work just as well, but this is clearly a lie. I hooked the Klipsch satellites up to the Logitech head unit and sub and heard the incredible difference the separate tweeters make. For the price of this system, I feel slightly ripped off. I do love the adjustments, screen and inputs though.PROS-Lots of inputs-Screen, remote and adjustments-Good mids-Wires are reasonable long, no stupid proprietary plugsCONS-Weak bass-Poor highs-Cheap plastic construction and plastic bases-Huge subwoofer (I could barely find a place to put it!!)-Controls on the remote are better than those on the control pod"
1896,"I live in the LA Area and there is not a single frequency on the device that is not in use.  When in use, static is very common."
1897,"I bought these speakers without checking out the specifications, they can be utilized as great midrange and high frequency speakers"
1898,Relatively pricey. Too flimsy and hard to install using the double-sided tape. I like the fact that you can take the main unit out if you prefer to not use it. Chime is too loud for my tastes. Haven't really enabled the alarm yet.
1899,"With a Sandisk Extreme III 8GB 30MB/sec SDHC card, I am only able to achieve 12MB/sec write speed and 19MB/sec read speed with this reader.I would recommend that you go with the newer SDDR-199-A20 card reader. RW benchmarks can be found here:[...]"
1900,"This thing works like it was promised, but wished the tip was a bit more narrower. I needed something to write on my ipad during my math class in college, but found it actually harder to use than with fingers. I thought this stylus would improve my speed and handwriting, but the big broad tip is just not working out for me.Other than that, it works totally fine. My ipad detects the writing perfectly"
1901,"... it probably got old and tired.I've been using this stylus for over a year with an Acer W500 tablet running Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. During the past couple of months it seems like its ability to interact with the touchscreen has diminished. The touchscreen responds to direct finger touches just as it did before, so it looks like the stylus is the culprit here."
1902,"I bought the box wave stylus for my iPad. I was disappointed in it's initial use, for it's not very easy to use at first. You have to aim in the center of the stylus in order for the iPad to track your movements. But after you use it for a while, you eventually get used to it. After reading the reviews for this product I was expecting this product to work perfectly but it did not meet my expectations. Wish I would have bought a cheaper one."
1903,"I bought this ""Vantage Point CGUPM12-B Universal Front Projector Mount - Black"" for my Mitsubishi HC6500 Projector and the first impression is it a very small item as compared to the price. A simple Project mount could be delivered way cheaper than this. But the good thing is that it's a good build. Easy to move all direction makes it very convenient for installation and adjustment of the projector to the Media room."
1904,"Hi,I was disappointed that more information wasn't provided about what was not in this package, and the importance of it, namely the IR attachment. There should have been more info,."
1905,"This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion. Perhaps you've had better results, but I find this thing less than perfect."
1906,Would not read the IDE drive I have.  Do not know if drive is bad or product did not work as I had no other IDE drives to use and have not as of yet determined the status of the IDE drive I have.
1907,"I purchased this print server a few days ago and decided to wait until Saturday to set it up, anticipating it would take a few hours.  I was right.  Actually, it took over 3 hours and a lot of frustration.  Linksys' documentation isn't great.  They show you screenshots, diagrams of the configuration, and say ""Click Next"" without a word about whether you're supposed to do the thing they're showing you.  Then, they made a major mistake by not telling me that after you configure the print server, you also have to configure the PC.  I figured that out after 2.5 hours of no printing and no help.  Be sure to run both sections of the CD set up, not just the ""configure print server"" part, but the ""configure PC"" as well.  I've got everything working now but I'm not really sure that it's the way it should be set up, if I just kludged it together, or if I got it right by accident.It would be nice if I felt confident and assured about Linksys' products and their ease of use."
1908,The reception that it pick is low.  I had to invest in a inline signal amplifier from radio shack.
1909,"What can I say? It is just like any other case of this type. It does a great job of protecting the GPS unit from scratches and etc....However, it does make it more difficult to turn on and view the screen. I would rather use a screen protector and slip it into a camera type case to make the GPS unit easier to deploy and use."
1910,"I set the unit to 192.168.1.76 and all prints came out mirror image.  Customer support advised settings to no avail.  But when I changed the IP address, it printed alright.  However, I was never able to implement my automatic double-sided printing so I exchanged it for a Linksys PSUS4 which had no problem doing automatic double-sided printing and using any ip address."
1911,"This is a good idea and a must have if you live in California.  However, mine didn't work out of the box.  One of the brass strips that makes contact with the gps unit was too far in to make a good connection.  Since I had no use for the windshield mount, that came with the unit, I cannabilized it for parts and made the dashmount one work.  If you get one, I recommend you buy it at a place that you can inspect it before you leave the store."
1912,good for its price and works in Syracuse NY but as with all of these it depends on your location to the antennas.  Some stations are very weak - i.e. Channel 5 in Syracuse and hard to keep on track
1913,"This performs marginally better than an omnidirectional antenna that costs about half as much.The house is located about 15 miles from city's antenna ""farm"" and receives terrible analog signals, but gets generally good digital signals, with some occaisional noise. This was bought hoping to improve on the omni antenna's performance, but little benefit was seen."
1914,The design doesn't inspire confidence and the headset is generally uncomfortable.  Because I spend long amounts of time on the computer I do notice my ears hurting with this headset.It works just fine as a product but do not recommend.
1915,"These headphones are fine for using with your computer. There isn't much difference between these and my Sennheiser 555. I use my line-out from the motherboard; nothing to notice there. There is very little noise-cancellation, if any at all. For $20 you won't be too disappointed when the kids throw them on the ground. The ""sound mode"" switch is just there for looks as far as I'm concerned.When I plugged these into my Roland drum kit I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money if you plan on using these for studio quality enjoyment. (I use the Sony MDR-V6. They replaced a pro set that broke after 15 years. I don't think music can sound better than this)"
1916,I ordered this and then realized that there is a TuneJuice 2!!! The TJ2 works off AAA batteries and works MUCH longer. It will give you a much better back up.
1917,"Got this at Bestbuy, when I had to replace my wifi router.  My HP 1020 laser printer doesn't work with it, but my Canon Pixma i4000r does.  There is really no way to know if your printer is supported until you test it out.  Netgear is too lazy to do the testing themselves.The HP won't print a test page.  No error message, just doesn't do anything.  I have read that the bi-directional communications are the problem.The Canon works fine from all 4 of my computers.  There is an error message when the printer tries to send info to the computer.  Far as I can tell, the print server doesn't support any of that info, like out-of-paper messages."
1918,The battery work okay a first then after two months with very little use it would not hold a charge and didn't last for more than 10 min
1919,"First, a couple of things.I wanted this camera to be great. I researched all the consumer dSLRs and decided on the XT Rebel 350 because of it's size and 8MP CCD, plus, I'd had two Canon point and shoot digitals that were fantastic.I've been taking pictures on a semi-professtional level for thirty years and I attended Brooks Institute of Photography, so I sort of know what I'm doing.Bought the Rebel XT at a local store in San Francisco, along with the Canon 28-200 Zoom. Immediately went up to Chinatown to shoot pictures of the Festival of the Harvest Moon with my wife, who was using her Nikon D70 with the Nikon 28-200.Shot pictures all day, and absolutely loved the way the XT handled. It was very intuitive, fast, had a bright viewfinder -- I couldn't have been happier.Then, we got home and looked at the pictures. I'd shot mostly on automatic, or shutter priority all day, with shutter speeds above 250th of a second.Bottom line, my wife's pictures were crystal clear, popped really, and mine of the same or similar subjects were just a tad fuzzy. You couldn't tell at 5x7 or so, but when you brought it up to 8x10  or above the difference was obvious. I checked the historgram on the shots, and they were made at nearly the same settings. Couldn't be, right? After all, the Nikon is only 6 MP, the Canon 8MP.So I put both cameras on a tripod, pointed them at a brick wall with a sign about 100 feet away, set everything the same on the cameras, and low and behold, same fuzziness.I took the Canon back the next day and traded it in on a D70. Now, maybe I got a bad lense, or a camera where the auto-focus was tweaked, but I couldn't afford the time to test it out again and again. I knew the Nikon would work, and it did (and does).Since then, I've talked to friends, professionals, who say that the XT is known to have auto-focus ""issues"".  This seems to be inconsistent, with some reviewers being delighted by the camera, others having a little problem.As I said above, the camera handles really well, intuitively, and  I actually like the compact size (some SLR users like a heavier camera). I may have gotten a lemon, but if you are going to need to depend on getting sharp pictures and can't go back for reshoots, I'd step up to the Canon D20 or go with a Nikon dSLR."
1920,"This product is used with a Midnight desktop computer running Windows XP and an HP LaserJet IIIP printer which never had a USB connection (and my Midnight never had a parallel port connection).Sometimes it works great but then sometimes it doesn't.  The problem seems to be the random reassignment of the ""virtual"" USB port created in Windows XP when it detects this plug 'n play device.  The result is that unless you've ""guessed correctly"" about which virtual USB port your printer output is going to, your computer-sent printer data will never reach the printer.  Instead, the data sits in a black hole printer queue waiting for a printer to be connected to the proper virtual USB port.Simply powering-off the PC or disconnecting the printer from the PC seems to scramble the USB port assignment for this device.  We've been unable to resolve this recurring problem.  We do know how to remedy the problem when it occurs but it is often a very aggravating process.I've not tried other parallel to USB port converter/adapters so I do not know if this is a common problem with the concept or just a problem with this particular device.I'd seriously recommend that you try a different brand of device if you are wanting to use a parallel port printer with your Windows PC.P.S.  This review was completely rewritten after the product FINALLY arrived via USPS.  My initial review was to complain about Company A's tendency to announce that products have shipped when in fact they haven't.  The problem with delayed shipping by Company A continues but isn't related to the performance of this product.  Accordingly, I've re-written the review to include pertinent details about the actual product (which finally arrived after shipping 4 days AFTER Company A said it did)."
1921,"Lab tests and many user reviews attest this lens great optical performance. I compared it to the 70-300 L IS, and I found no visible difference despite huge difference in price and weight. Note that despite good optical quality and low weight this Canon has several shortcomings, some of which took me by surprise because are not mentioned by most of the reviews. Let me enumerate:1) No hood included! Wow, that's stingy considering the $40 price tag on the original hood.2) Zoom has a creep, and that's why the lock switch is provided. Its a hassle to lock/unlock.3) Front element rotates, not very common these days.4) No FTM focus (full time manual focus). That took me totally by surprise! Not many Canon lenses lack this so famous 'Canon feature', which nowadays Nikon also implements.5) Focus ring is... LOCKED unless the manual switch AF/MF is in the ""manual focus"" position!! And even worse, this ring is still locked even when the lens is dismounted.The limitation (5) is ridiculous, because the inner ring in this lens extends significantly with the focus. In order to stow the lens, one has to flip the switch, turn the ring, flip the switch back. What a hassle, a very rare limitation in any contemporary lens. I think the only silver lining here is that a long zoom is commonly used for distant objects, thus the ring mostly does not really protrude too much.I also compared this lens to the recent Tamron 70-300 VC, and I must say, Tamron 'got a point' here. If you are shopping for a 70-300 light, the Tamron might be the better choice. But when the 200-300 reach is not so important, considering the resolution of our 2012/2013 bodies (20Mpix), surely the magnificent 70-200 F/4 L IS is the by far superior choice. Several other reviewers have also made this recommendation."
1922,"When I am walking to work, listening to music on my iPod, all is well.  But to adjust it, I must get it out of the protective cocoon I have devised.  Just like so many other folks, I proudly handed my new iPod to friends and family the first day I got it.  Then I looked at it -- Ugh!  It looked like I dragged it along a sidewalk for a mile by the headphones.  I went to Decalgirl and got some skins to cover it -- but too late.  It is not ruined but....How does Black Nano work?  Well, the synching with iTunes, etc., works fine.  And the sound is OK but I agree with others that anyone interested should look seriously at the Mini.  The Mini is tough, has loads of accessories (including cases!), and works well.And finally -- when is Apple going to ship a complete product?  For $250, the Nano should come with decent headphones, a travel/home charging kit, and, most of all, a protective case.  If Apple had any sense they'd throw in $10 worth of iTunes songs as an intro to that service."
1923,"These are nice earbuds, and if I hadn't bought them specifically in order to sleep with them on, I'd probably give them a 5 star review.  However, I did purchase them in order to sleep with them on, and they are not very comfortable when laying on your side.  The cushion portion that fits into the ear is a very nice foam material, but the portion of the earbud that the foam ""sits"" on is too long, so it protrudes out from my ears a little too much, placing pressure on my eardrums when I try to sleep on my side.Other than not recommending these to sleep with, they are very good.  Pretty comfortable when you just have them in your ears, almost as good as normal earplugs would be at blocking out ambient noises, cord is well constructed, haven't had any problems with sound only working in one earbud (as some other products seem to have).  Overall, a very nice product, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing these if you intend, as I did, to sleep with them on."
1924,I wish these fully enclosed the battery but other than that they work fine. I suppose I can always use a penny or something as a spacer...
1925,"This little MP3 player is based on flash memory instead of a hard drive. Compared to hard drives which eventually die, an MP3 player based on flash memory is a longer-lasting investment. The Nano Plus is loaded with features such as one gigabyte of storage for music or other files, an FM radio, a built in mic and various recording functions. Like most consumer grade MP3 players such as the iPod, the Nano Plus cannot play albums without gaps in between the tracks. Audiophiles who carefully encode their albums using gapless-capable formats may want to avoid this player and seek out high-end players such as Rio Karma. Firmware upgrades could eventually give gapless playback capability to the Nano Plus. Sadly, with all its amazing features the Nano Plus is cheaply built from flimsy plastic. From a design perspective the Nano Plus looks like it could have been engineered by Homer Simpson. It has an odd navigation system that ultimately does get the job done. The overall sound quality is decent--as good or better than any iPod but a far cry from the likes of Cowon iAudio. Dragging music onto the device is simple and requires no special software besides basic storage drivers. It shows up like a regular drive. With only the drivers installed from the Creative web site you can avoid using the included CD. It comes with a soft rubber case which is very useful for protecting this delicate toy from destruction. Be extremely careful if you plan to use the Zen Nano Plus while excerising. A single AAA battery keeps it playing for up to 18 hours. Considering the battery is easily replaceable you could potentially own this device for many many years without it needing service or replacement."
1926,"Yes, it will just hold your camera but will not protect it to a great extent. It is so perfectly designed that they have not left any room for anything else. Also there is no proper cushion or anything inside which protects the camera."
1927,It's an ok keyboard. Not as good as apple's fit and finish. There is even a key that doesn't do anything.It's very heavy and sturdy. But the keys are not very pleasant to use.The only reason I would think to get one is if you really really want your keyboard to be both wireless and have a numeric pad.I prefer the apple keyboard because it's identical to the macbook or macbook pro keyboards so it feels exactly the same and I make fewer mistakes on it.
1928,"I bought one of these and it worked great for quite a while.  There was an issue with the firmware that caused any files written to the drive to be stamped with the current date/time.  Per the company web site, they have a fix for this that involved updating the firmware .... which totally rendered my drive 100% dead/unusable.  If it was truly only a firmware issue, there is still hope for the drive itself, and I'm still working on getting the data back.These drives run VERY hot (see other reviews for their similarly packaged products).  This is a source of stress for users who worry about these sorts of things.  It can't be good for the internal workings to run that hot.  There is no fan or ventilation holes on the unit.  The unit is basically a standard IDE drive inside an aluminum box.  Since it is running some sort of Linux OS you can't just pop the drive into your PC and expect to see anything at all on the drive.Simpletech says the hot case is 'normal' and that (despite the laws of physics) the drive inside the case is actually cooler than the case.  There is nothing other than air that links the heat producing hard-drive to the external case, which supposedly serves as a heat sink.  Air is not a good conductor of heat, and if the external case is as hot as it is, the guts of this unit (and all the others they sell of identical design) must be much hotter.  Over the long haul this heat has to be bad news for the drive and the electronic components inside the case.  Since many users put lots of data on these drives (mine is 400mb) and time+heat is bad...well, just think about it ... the more you come to rely on it the more likely it is to fail.  Not a good combination in my book.  They saved a dollar or two by not putting a fan (or even air vent holes) in it ... but it was a big mistake in my opinion.  It should be noted that most similar external USB drives from other manufacturers seem to have a 'no-fan' design as well.It does have a three year warranty, (unusual these days) but it is basically a replacement policy, not data recovery service which is of course the ONLY issue when your drive fails.  I checked with a company that specializes in data recovery ... they quoted $1800 to do 400gb.Plan ""B"" is to buy TWO of them and copy everything from one to the other every day (or even more often). Just pray they both don't fail on the same day."
1929,Autofocus does not work at higher zoom. Have to switch to manual focus. Havent used the macro mode much. Otherwise the results are OK.
1930,I bought this after my Zen Micro filled up.  I liked it for the most part....Until it froze on me and I didn't have a phillips small enough to get the casing off so I could pull the batteries.  My Micro just has a slide panel in back that makes it easy to pull the batteries.  I've since misplaced or had the unit stolen so I don't know if it will even be any good if I do find it.  In general I like Creative and will stick with that brand the next time around....Only not this design.
1931,"After I used my new ipot for a month my feeling is....not uesr friendly as I though. My personal feeling is it should be easy to load my MP3 into my ipot without any software, but it costs many confuse (may be I'm too old)I cannot transfer my video to my ipot and I have to search any available software to tranfer my video file to my ipot. Some software doesn't work fine and i-tune isn't transfer file too."
1932,"The space bar makes the most horrendous clack. Rather irritating but overall a good product, makes typing easy and cushioned wrist pad is wonderful, with the adjustable feet (could do with maybe one more position) and the elevator for the cushioned wrist pad, it should be easy to find a comfortable typing position.The noise the keys make - ok the space bar that is entirely another story."
1933,"These lenses worked out perfectly until somehow dust creeped inside my wide lens. It didn't last too much longer because I dropped it on the cement while on vacation and put a nice crack down the center. It was fun while it lasted, but not something that is meant to be around forever."
1934,"The switch works exactly as promised with no degradition in signal quality. The problem is with the remote, it has very little range. I am controling it with my logitech universal and this is the only component that does not switch sometimes. Event the remote that is supplied worked intermittently."
1935,"This MP3 player is feature packed, but getting music on and off this thing is a nightmare (really).  I have since learned that my money would have been better spent on an Ipod."
1936,"I would have strongly considered buying this, but for some reason Logitech thought having less buttons than my MX510 would make this a better mouse.  When playing games like WoW or surfing the net via Firefox having those extra buttons are a great convenience.The perfect mouse would be to integrate the new features of the G7 (wireless, left/right scrolling) into the MX510/MX518 layout.Try again Logitech."
1937,"Working well so far but the plugs on the back are too close and so if you have adapters that are large they can cover two plugs.  The front panel digital display is interesting but kind of boring.  More could have been done.  As for the main purpose, so far so good."
1938,"Loved the camera but both the originally ordered one, and then its replacement, had lens problems.  The original had a nick/scratch INSIDE the lens.  The replacement did not.  The replacement DID have a very distinctly visible band of cemented glue ALL the way around the INSIDE of the zoom lens.  The original did not.Called Canon and their CSR apparently took a look at an A620 they have in their center and said he saw the same thing and that it shouldn't be a problem.Whatever. I expect a purchased-new product's construction to be perfect.  At least give me the illusion of quality control and standards.Shame Company A won't replace it again. Maybe the third one would have been the charm.*****UPDATE*****Company A did send third replacement.  But this one had noticeable vibration and noise when focusing and the ""shake"" warning came on with EVERY shot even when I sat it on a table to test it.  Kept the one with the ring."
1939,"This is the second SAMSUNG Blu-ray disc player I've owned, and it was a little faster to load than the prior...but it is still extremely SLOW to boot up a DVD...even a regular (non-Blu-ray) disc.  I have to imagine there are faster products out there."
1940,WORKS FINE AND USE TO CHARGE ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD CHEAGE IN THE CAR PLUG THING IS A LITTLE LOSE. MAY NEED ELECTRIC TAPE TO MAKE IT STAY IN.
1941,"I've had my DJ 20 for a year now, and overall, Im happy with it, although its my first mp3 player. The only quirk so far, it has froze up 2 times, but easily remedied with the reset ""hole"" on the bottom. I have no idea if other brand mp3 players freeze up like that, but its a bit disappointing. The battery lasts a long time for me, so no complaints there. The program to upload music is ""musicmatch"" which after a while of figuring out how to use it, works mostly OK, but it also has froze up on occasion, which is very annoying. So my overall ratings are- -DJ ""good""  software--""OK""."
1942,"I have an older stereo in my car that does not have an accessory input, and the cassette deck stopped working (it just keeps spitting out the cassette/adapter). So until such time that I can replace the stereo, I have to rely on FM transmitters. I have a Pioneer Inno for my XM/Sirius radio needs, and it does a great job in completely taking over the FM signal when the radio is tuned to a good frequency. Keep in mind that my Inno is the older technology, not the newer one that physically connects to the antenna. I drive all day in my job (sales), and I cover a span of about 50 miles east/west and 40 miles north/south, and I never have to change the frequency for the XM.However, for this Griffin Roadtrip, I simply cannot find a frequency that is static-free when playing the ipod. It seems to help a bit if I touch the ipod with my finger (I guess I'm acting as a ground), but I certainly can't be driving around like that all day. I've used it twice since I got it, but it sounds so bad that it's just not worth it. Even though it's not recommended while driving, I'd just as soon listen with my earbuds.The instructions say that it is preferred that you find an unused frequency that is surrounded by two frequencies that are not used or have very weak signals on them. Well, I live and work in north Jersey. I'm between NYC and PA. There's not even two unused frequencies in a row, much less three.I suggest that before anyone buys this that they check their entire FM spectrum and see if they have several unused frequencies together. If you do, then it might work better for you. If you don't, it's not worth it. Especially at the price it is now. As of this writing, it's $17 more than I paid, and I feel I overpaid.And don't make the same mistake I did and assume that just because you have another electronic device with an FM transmitter that works like a charm that this will as well. It doesn't.4 stars for ease of use and 2 stars for sound quality (It would have been one, but it works to a degree. You can hear the music over the static noise, but you hear the noise quite distinctively.)"
1943,"I ski, so this player needs to be stronger in the cold. It isn't.  Otherwise, the included ear buds sound almost as good as my Sennheisers, and the battery life is excellent.  The download speed is very good, and it has a nice ability to handle subdirectories as playlists.  The controls are great.  I'd recommend it for any activity over say Freezing!"
1944,"The cord definitely works, but it feels very flimsy and thin. I would not expect this product to withstand any rodents chewing on it or extensive use. You get what you pay for. It shipped VERY fast!"
1945,"It worked for what I needed it for. It's a wire what else can I say?ok I needed more words, the end."
1946,Gave me the flexibility I needed to extend my USB cords from my computer to my TV for a game
1947,"Just got this drive after purchasing a Corsair 64gb.  The Kingston 64gb is smaller than the Corsair but does not come with the lanyard, case or strap.  The Kingston comes as pictured.  That being said, it's smaller than the Corsair and seems to be approximately what you'd expect a flash drive to be in size.  Unfortunately, to get this unit working out of the box, I immediately had to reformat the drive to start copying the 50gb of data that I needed to get to it.  In addition, I found the speed to be much slower than that of the Corsair.  I'd only recommend this if you're looking for a smaller flash drive where you don't mind the speed."
1948,"I've only had this for a couple days and haven't put it through all its paces yet, but in most respects it's a great player for the price, I won't go into the features since they are clear from the specs. What possibly doesn't pop out at you when you first glance at the specs, and which may turn you off to this product, is that it has no S-video in or out, nor does the built-in TV tuner recognize NTS stereo.Or to put it another way, when you record a tv program, you lose the stereo sound -- it is converted to mono.  (No dolby 5.1 either BTW.) Lots of people will be so put off by this that they'll pass on the recorder. Turns out I can live with it as I mostly want to digitize old camcorder tapes from an camcorder that only recorded in mono and had no S-video or Firewire connections. For this kind of old fashioned equipement, the Lite-on 5115 worked fine; recording a great picture.When I buy an expensive HD TV setup in a couple years I'll no doubt buy a different and more expensive DVD recorder to go with it."
1949,"Since these are so cheap I can't blame the product quality, but mine broke within a month or two. I ended up just buying one of the higher end ones. So 3$ for a month or two, but if you need something that will last and can take more of a beating then just go for something better made (yeah that means more expensive).I took mine apart and found that the problem was a faulty connection between a spring and the circuit board, tried soldering it once and got it working. Shortly after it broke again though. In the end decided it wasn't worth the time."
1950,"I didn't read the description carefully enough, as I incorrectly assumed that a 15-in-1 reader would include xD. With the millions of Olympus and Fuji cameras out there it seems strange to omit the format from what is otherwise a very nice reader."
1951,Being using this pendrive for about 5 months with no reliabilty issues. The speed is normal and like the ruggetized cover.
1952,"This lamp is okay. Not fashionable, and kind of flimsy, and the light isn't that great, but if you need a no frills lamp this is a pretty good deal."
1953,"I've owned these for 2 years now, and I've used them both at my desk and brought them with me on long flights. I've used them to watch movies on my tablet, too. I'd say the worst thing about these is the inline battery for the bass boosting functions. The battery compartment (and volume control) is probably at the worst point along the cord, and there's no way at all to remove it. This is actually my complaint about many of the Skullcandy products: You cannot tell if the cord has a big old battery box in the middle, while looking at the outside of the box. Thankfully on Company A, there's now customer photos of this annoying little thing. If that little box were gone, these would be my favorite headphones though.Pros:- Totally over the ear, blocks out sound well- Folds up and comes with carrying bag- Pretty durable; they've taken quite a beating at the bottom of my backpackCons:- Extremely annoying in-line battery compartment, makes the headphones weigh down your head- Carrying case/bag is a little small for them- 2-prong adapter for airlines is a bit too thick for the two-prong recessed holes on some planes (probably shouldn't have made it hard plastic, 2 wires would fit more planes than a plastic block)I'm honestly not really sure there's really an advantage to the 'fold-up' form factor."
1954,"Image is not great in the eyepiece, faded and chromatically aberrant, but very handy in avoiding crawling on the ground to focus close up."
1955,"Well anyway, I ordered these,  through Digi Acc because of the good reviews that it had.  I never heard of Sakar but it seemed like a good cheap alternative base on reviews, but I was very disappointed.  What I got was 3 Zeiko's filters, rated dirt on Company A.  When I did try them on they seem to work fine with photos taken in the morning or indoors, until you use them for night pictures then you see unwanted light trails and halos, glares and everything else.  I recently purchased the Marumi UV filter and saw a big difference. The glass difference is like an oakley glasses compared to gas station sunglasses.  Save your money for the better filters. I would only recommend these filters as protection for your lens and nothing else.Digi Acc did admit to their mistake and refunded my purchase price, big ups to them for that."
1956,"i've had this camera for almost a year. i like the camera itself. it is small, not too heavy and has a big screen for looking at pictures you have just taken. there is very little camera lag and it takes good, quick shots in low light. i just up the exposure a bit in iphoto afterwards. the battery lasts a long time and you don't need a special charging cord so if you forget to pack it or whatever you can probably find something else to do the trick.but i don't care for the picture quality. i used to have a canon and though i did not like the camera the pictures looks good even when i blew them up. if i zoom in just a little with this camera is looks fuzzy. if you care about the quality of your pictures i wouldn't recommend this camera but if you just want to document your life and print some 4x6s it's fine. anyone with artistic aspirations should move on."
1957,"All,This camera is packed with features, almost too many. If you've worked with other hitech devices the menu is very logical. The play-back video quality is kind of grainy and my older chunky Sony Camcorder has better picture quality, I expected better from this newer model. Camera is not for the beginner. This model comes with all the cables. The model below this (HC-32) comes without some of the cables and the features of this one. So better to spend the extra money and get this one than go searching on e-bay for all the obscure connectors. Being able to record onto Memory Stick Duo Pro is neat, but quality is even lower and they don't give you a starter stick. You need a real steady hand with this camera. The camera is incredibly compact./Brian"
1958,"I bought this SR 100 two months ago and I have taken many videos of my new born. The video is beyond excellent. I changed the settings to LP because the files are so big. 5 min of recording I get  a 1/4 gig file size!!As far as the digital still pictures I was very disappointed. It is a 3.0 MP and I expected to do as good as any 3.0 mp camera especially that it has a special lens. I think it has do to with the type of processing that is not up to speed. From reading the reviews and sony's website, it sounded that the 3.0mp is amazing but to come to find out it sucks. I was hoping this replaced my 4.0 MP c-4000 Olympus but that is not the case. I carry both with me. Anytime I need to take a digital photo, I pull out my c-4000 and anytime I need a video, I pull my SR-100.Sony, Please improve on your still pictures. I was hoping to use only one unit for both my video and still!ThanksFrankHouston TX"
1959,"I only have SATA drives (one 200 and one 1TB) and it works fine with both. The pins are numbered on the SATA connection to the USB cable and you simply need to match the pin numbers, i.e., 1-2-3-4 on each. A couple of the pins were a little loose and I had to individually shove them in to secure the connection. This cabling works fine for short-term applications, but wouldn't be appropriate for routine use. It would be nice if the cables were a little longer and if a small bag was supplied to fit the cabling for storage and transfer--I use an old shaving kit bag. I trust that it will also work on an IDE drive, but don't yet know for certain."
1960,"I have other digital cameras and wanted something quick and easily pocketed. Indoor shots are only fair; often blurred. This camera needs an anti-shaking feature since it is so small and lightweight (I have a hard time holding it steady). I would prefer that the camera have a manual mode in addition to the automatic modes. Still, for general use, the camera does a reasonable job. The price is right. Unlike some reviewers, I do not find the body cheap or ""plastic"" but rugged feeling. I have not found every shot to be great, though. Some are wonderful; others are only so-so. Results outdoors are dependable but not indoors and in low light."
1961,It is really too bad that Garmin uses a proprietary pin configuration for their chargers.  You can't just use any random USB cable to charge their GPS'.  That is why they are so expensive.
1962,"Buying the TV was easy. However, shipping was horrible. The TV sat in the SF warehouse for 4 days until I called EAGLE. Even with Company A Prime, it took over 2 weeks. They finally made arrangement to deliver it today. Once unpacked, the unit looked nice. The problem was the loud buzzing noise from the back (upper right, most likely power supply). It was so loud everyone in the family noticed it- essentially making it useless. I have asked for a refund from Company A and also called Samsung to find out if there is an easy fix. This particular unit was mfg 9/2006 in Mexico."
1963,"I'm sure that this mic is probably an alright mic when it comes to all sorts of uses--quality audio for youtube videos, web conferences, online meetings, etc--but it is definitely not a mic you want to buy if you are wanting to record quality vocals to put in a song.There seems to be a tendency for the diaphragm of this mic to allow a build up and reverberation of the low-mid frequencies around 200 Hz, probably because of the overall shape of the mic's diaphragm itself. If you take an equalizer and focus on that frequency range, you can even hear a light echo. The thing that makes this an especially bad problem for a mic to have is that, because of where it's at in the frequency spectrum, there's not much you can do to remove it without changing the overall quality and tonality of the vocals.So overall? If you're a bedroom producer like me, this is close, but no cigar. Just buy a more expensive mic that will plug into your audio interface."
1964,"PCWorld gave this a 90 in terms of sound.  The specs do not tell you everything and how they're even weighting this is messed up.  The new Nano has a very lean sound, with slightly deemphasized bass and emphasized highs.  That 3dB of imbalance has to be an upward slope from bottom to top.  You can indeed hear a 3dB deviation of that kind in such a trend.  One of the other reviewers said ""If the bass is in the music, you'll here it.""  That is almost always what apologists say about a component that is not doing the low-end justice.  ""Well that music just doesn't have enough bass.""  B.S.  Most music should have reasonably present lows.  Even stupid people know when a piece ought not to have any, and that previous statement is implying people who think the said component is bass-shy are stupid.  Even if they were, that wouldn't matter.  And they (we're) not.The highs and mids on the Nano also lack the refinement and delicacy of the new 30GB iPod.  Didn't PCWorld rate that one as lower?  The only problem I had with the 30GB's sound was an overly warm, rounded quality...at least until the headphone amp was overdriven to the point of nonlinearity (relationship between frequency response and dynamic range), in which case it became brittle on top.  The Nano, in contrast, was never lacking in hardness in the highs unless it was turned down...not from the absolute volume, but the relative volume of the particular song.  This was not a symptom of overdriving the HP amp, but rather the sound being so low as to make this unrefined-quality imperceptible.  In this way, it often reminded me of a cheap computer soundcard.  Yet it is also true that many flash drives fall short of even this categorization.  The 30GB model also had far superior stereo separation and low-end extension.  Overall the HD iPod sounded far better than the Nano.  The Nano may be more neutral in the mids, but I'd say overall they're about the same amount of neutrality, just a different variety of it and different ""quality"" of those frequencies (e.g. the lack of delicacy).  The HD models are very inviting when you first start listening to them.  The Nano just isn't.  Thus, it needs to be paired with a warm, slightly bass emphasized, very open sounding headphone.The Archos 104 also had a lean sound, but did separation much better, too.  I found the Sansa e260 to have extremely good bass, but very congested stereo separation and a tendency to become tinny (a non-linearity problem) in the highs when the HP amp was overdriven.  While the Sansa was less transparent than all the others, I did find its tonal balance and texturing to be more compelling and accurate to the original material, possibly the reason I kept cranking it up and messing up the HP amp performance on the top end.  Goldfrapp's second album's synths and vocal processing sound more ""right"" to me than the other players can pull off.  But the e260 could also be gritty, murky, and spatially far too narrow at times.  The Phillips GoGear 30GB just plain sucked.  Bad interface.  Bad sound.  Avoid.  For the most part you're left simply having to admit that the iPod Nano doesn't have some of the sonic defects of some of its competitors, but I cannot rule out the Creative products as being superior.  They certainly are in terms of separation.  That is something that measured specs will indeed inform you on.  All the Creative products do that well, but I cannot yet speak from first hand experience on the Zen V Plus's overall sound.  For the price of this iPod, you could get one with twice the storage.Apple itself has become rather arrogant.  They don't even include a software disk with their iPods anymore.  If you're not already using iTunes or don't have a broadband connection active at that very moment, they don't want to even bother with you.  After all, if you're that lame to be using Windows or visiting your parents out in the country where they can't get broadband, why would you be buying a hip Apple product?  Most Apple users couldn't find their way around either the inside of a computer or their OS configuration & processes screens.  As someone who's used Final Cut extensively and use to tutor on OSX computers, I can tell you Apple has its share of problems.  There's a reason why Avid is still the standard.  I find those new Apple commercials to be utter jokes.From a functional and aesthetic standpoint, I also find the iPod Nano to be too thin.  It should be shorter and thicker.  In that format, the HP amp and battery could have been improved.  There's just no utility to this shape.  I constantly feel like I'm going to break it in half.  It looks and works like it was made by and for small feminine hands.  I have average to slightly-below average size hands for a 5'10"" Caucasian male and the design is clearly more to look at than to use.  What makes Apple think having a long, flat, rectangular object in your pocket with corners is a good idea?  I also cannot stand their interface.  After you do anything, you'd better put that hold button on immediately.  The touch wheels are far too sensitive.  I'd say a good 25% of the time you are either making menu mistakes or taking great pains to prevent them.  And even though I have used iPods before, I have blasted my ears at least twice from this touch-wheel.Other issues: Works only with iTunes.  No microSD slot and no replaceable battery, though only the Sansa does.  When the battery finally needs replacing (possibly only 9 months later if you use it frequently) it will cost about $50 & two weeks, and you will not get your iPod back with the music on it.  There's no Mass Storage Mode for getting music onto it and you can't copy music off the unit, god forbid you should lose any original recordings on your computer.  Video, FM tuners, and voice recorders are extras, in my opinion, and don't really count against Apple.  However, comparable Creative Labs products with twice the space for the price certainly aren't hurt by including them.So there you go.  Knowledge is power, and sometimes that power can simply come in the form of the courage to possibly buck a trend."
1965,This is my third suction cup mount for my Nuvi 350. The first one that came with the product for quite awhile. I never removed the suction cup mount from the window and the sun and heat melted the rubber suction cup and it deteriorated. My wife has a Nuvi 340 and the same thing happened to her suction cup. I ordered a couple more.The second one broke at the hinge after about 8 months of use. My wife's is still working fine.I ordered a couple more. I have been using the new one for several months now and just returned from a trip where I used it in a rental car. No problems so far.
1966,"I got one of these for the holidays last year (12/06) and I was totally stoked. This was my first iPod--what a shame that it turned out to be such a fragile, poorly engineered device. I mean, this thing got dropped once from about 2.5 feet (it was only 2 months old) and it was TOAST (and it was in a plastic hardshell case!). I have had Laptops that survived worse. Come to think of it, I've had a lot of (far cheaper) devices that are better able to take abuse than this $400 item--including TV remotes, cell phones, Nintendo Game Boys (designed to be nearly indestructible), OTHER MP3 PLAYERS, etc. It seems that a physically appealing design does not necessarily equate to superior engineering--quite the opposite in this case. I do like it, and the replacement I got from Apple works very well. It's great looking and it does the job well. Too bad I'm so terrified of dropping it that I had to buy a big, bulky silicone case to improve its chances of survival. Let me tell ya, in its crash-test-dummy outfit, it no longer looks even the slightest bit sleek.Have you ever dropped your keys when getting out of the car? Your cell phone? If you answered yes to either of the above, then you can probably expect to drop your iPod one day. I hope you have a (thickly) carpeted garage--or that it lands on your foot. Bottom line: If I were thinking of getting an MP3 player, iPod or another brand, it would have zero moving parts; on other words, I would buy a flash-based device instead of one with a hard drive.I also cannot help but wonder why Nintendo does not take what they have learned about building child-proof, nearly indestructible portable gaming devices and apply this to a worthy competitor to the iPod. I would be the first in line...I gave this product 3 stars because it does a good job of what it is touted to do: play MP3s & video/images. In fact, the user interface, including the GUI and the click wheel is one of the nicest, most intuitive designs I have ever seen on a piece of consumer electronics equipment. Too bad it's put together so cheaply. Grossly overpriced? Most definitely. I hope the iPhone turns out to be a higher quality piece.---UPDATE: 8/2013: still working fine... :)"
1967,"I find this to be a good product for the music fan. There is more than enough space even for the average enthusiast. There is so much space on here that sometimes I forget what I have stored on it. I have had some issues where the device will ""lock up"" on me. Examples of this are trying to turn it on and nothing happens. Often I have had to turn the lock switch on and then off again prior to pressing the on button. Also, there are times when after pressing play to begin a track, you will see the track time counting but the actual song will not be playing.The size of this item may get anoying after a while, but it does not bother me too much. I just like the fact I have cd-less music on the go. Movies on here look marvelous! The screen is a very good size. The tuner on it picks up local stations well but don't expect to be able to tune in AM channels. It simply does not and I wish it did because I listen to a lot of AM sports talk radio.Considering the fact that I purchased this primarily for music and not video I am going to have to rate this item a 3/5 after I factor in the ""locking up"". Don't get me wrong; pictures look great and the clock is a great tool. Unfortunately there is no calendar which I think would be a plus. Overall, I like it but due to the fact that mostly everything is IPod compatible (i.e. docking stations), i'm considering trading mine in for an IPod.***UPDATE*** 22 Jan 09Ok, that part about trading in my Zune for and Ipod....forget it! A couple of weeks ago I thought that my Zune had stopped functioning when in actuality the battery was dead. Long story! Being the music-crazed nut that I am, I went out the following day and purchased an 8GB Silver Ipod Nano ""chromatic"". Now this was not the first time I have used an Ipod but I will say now that I am officially on the Zune bandwagon. I don't care what the majority says, i'm taking Zune over Ipod anyday! Yes, everything is Ipod compatible but ITunes have yet to match Zune's Pass. I mean, $15 per month for non-stop albums? Between the Nano that I bought and this same white 30GB Zune, the Zune's menu even looks more refreshing. The Ipod does have more equalizer settings but it has not been enough for me to abandon my Zune. I have an ""Apple-head"" teenager that ridicules my Zune for it's ""massive"" size. People, don't overrate the sizes! I like video on my Zune and the Nano's diminutive size makes me paranoid.Oh yes, this thing is so durable! I finally dropped it on the concrete and the thing has not missed a beat. Um...still 3/5 but that's a very positive 3."
1968,"Guess it was my bad, but I mistakenly assumed that the $5.95 shipping applied to my entire order.  I ordered two of these and was charged the ridiculous price of $11.90 for s/h.  I must have been asleep when I made the commitment to buy.  Obviously, the cheap price is supplemented by the outrageous shipping.  Kind of like the sellers on Ebay handle it."
1969,"Overall, I like the product, good sound...with a few exceptions:1)Be aware that the buzzer alarm is HORRIBLE...the pitch and sound pierces your central nervous system and it does NOT start low and increase as indicated in the manual.2) There is no way to preset/store radio stations.3) The time set/tuner and volume ""buton"" is an AWFUL design that is really hard to use/control. Design was NOT very well thought out.This items is REALLY good if you only plan to use the IPod with it, that is its focus...everything else was an afterthought."
1970,"I bought the Gigaworks T20 for my wife in early 2007.  We really loved the speakers.  I bought some for myself in late 2007, and they have served me well for months.  After about 9 months of light use, the right speaker stopped working with some loud popping noises.  I was going to submit a problem report, and tested all the knobs, and when I turned the BASS knob the right speaker started working again.  I decided to play a song, and about 2 minutes into the song the speaker failed.  If I turn the bass knob, I can get some really irritating loud pops, then the speaker will work again, for a short while.All of my equipment is connected to UPS surge protecting devices.  I suspect that there is a loose connection inside of the unit.I'm not turned off on Creative products because of this incident, and my wife's T20 is working just fine, and she uses hers a lot more than I use mine.  Overall, I like the T20 and would be willing to consider buying a T40, although after reading some of the other reviews in here, I might try out some other units as well."
1971,Lost my old charger and had to get this one. As always I feel like some of the accessories from Canon are overpriced. It's well and does it's job. No real complaint about it.
1972,"I got this item on sale from a local store, and for the size of the storage, it is a good deal. These things used to be very expensive, and for a 2 GB drive, the price has gone down considerably. Kiss your old floppy disks goodbye--USB Flash Drives are the wave of the future. They use your computer's USB drives as a means to move data to store on this drive.The SanDisk brand is a good solid name, so I decided to give this little drive a go. The packaging it comes in is ridiculous. You have to cut all around the outside of the drive, and closer to it than normal to open it. Once you make it through the casing, then you can appreciate it better. This drive does not have a cap like most; it comes with a slider that extends the tip of the USB so that you can plug it into the computer, and retracts when you don't need it. The idea is great, but the reality is mediocre. The slider causes the USB tip to retract when you are trying to insert it into the USB port. That means that it is harder to get into the port properly. And the tip is not well-protected from dust and dirt.A nice feature is that the area where the slider is lights up when it is in the port. It isn't particularly useful, but it is neat. It does come with a lanyard that is easy to connect the drive to, and it has a part that disconnects from the drive, so you don't have to take it off your neck when you want to insert it.The thing that really knocks this USB drive down for me is the U3 software. It is a great idea, really. It does have some neat features. You can encrypt the data on it, you can run programs right from the drive and keep them synchronized with the ones on your computer. The problem is that this little program goes on autorun everytime you insert it into your computer, and you don't have a say so in stopping it. This is fine if you only use a select number of private computers. But it can cause problems if you use computers across operating systems and platforms. I had a woman try to use this at the computer on my job (a public library), and she couldn't use the drive or access her files because the restrictions on the computer prevent users from running executable files for security (virus) reasons. She did not want to run a program, she just wanted to print her resume. She ended up out of luck, because there was no way to access her files without the program running.You can get rid of the program if you go to the U3 provider's webpage and download the uninstall program. Then your drive will be a normal USB drive, and you can use it anywhere. I think that the option to install U3 should have been given to the user. No one should have to uninstall a program that came on the drive, because this may be a hassle to most users.I find that without the U3 program, the drive is good. It is not as good as some of the other drives out there, but for what you need it for (storing and retrieving files), it works."
1973,You get smaller faster ones now in the market which are passport size and easy to carry.This is good for home office usage. I used one for a few years and it was easy to use esp the My Book software that helps you backup files easily
1974,"Had a TomTom One before this and this thing has been disappointing. Multiple times its taken me to Starbucks that didn't exist. I know they shut down a lot of Starbucks, but these locations were just insane and SB would have never existed there. The volume is too low to be heard over radio. You can plug it into auxiliary but then how do you listen to the radio? The battery life is not even close to 8 hours. Maybe an hour under normal use with volume turned up to audible (though barely at full volume) level and screen brightness up enough to see. I don't understand the good reviews here. This thing is really not that good. There are other annoyances like no option to avoid certain roads or picking a certain route. Very limited options on this thing. I will be looking for something else and selling this.Update: Stupid GPS. Let me elaborate. It wants you to go a certain route. If you don't go that route it will recalculate, but its stubborn. It wants you to still go the original way... miles and miles pass until finally I start over from scratch. I have to reprogram my destination...only then will it find the shortest route from my current location. Its just stupid."
1975,"Rarely I will find a tripod that support it, since this is a tool so much havy. It is a great part, but so havy"
1976,"Bought this unit after having owned a Garmin 2610 for years. Graphically, it looks nice with the 3d view an all, but that's really about it. I find the interface to be much more user unfriendly as compared to Garmin. I also don't like the fact that the unit doesn't come with any software to allow you to do any route planing, POI management on your computer. Everything must be done on the unit itself...which is kind of a pain if you're preparing for a big trip. Many things that are annoying about this unit are just not configurable either. For example, I like to see my speed on the display. But TomTom thinks that it should blink the speed in Red font (very difficult to see) if you go over the  speed limit by more than about 10%. This is pretty annoying....not to mention, the unit has incorrect speeds for many roads....so not very useful anyway. Overall, I don't think I'd buy another TOmTom unit. Only reason I tried it was because I'm temporarily living in the UK, and TomTom seem like the most popular unit here. So, I thought I'd give it a chance. Never again. I love Garmin."
1977,"I thought these would be better than the 2.4x spec'd discs. These discs seem to burn at 4x, 6x, 8x. At 8x verify errors occur, but at 4x there's a better chance a recording will work. Still better than not having a DL media for backup."
1978,"GOOD: Solid buttons, bottom mounted battery, a/v out AND in, plays DIVX or XVID formats (one main reason I chose it).BAD: does not play DVD+R (just a reminder - description lists the ""minus"" format)A problem cropped up after about 8 trips/6 months (adult use-very low stress).  Disk spin up was always noisy, with frequent grinding noises.  Lately it takes many open/close trials to get it to start to spin a disk when inserted and even freezes during playback on new DVDs.Judging from other reviews on the web, I seem to be an isolated case."
1979,"I have an cable tv tuner card in my computer and I was only able to get about 4 or 5 channels (tops) with a regular splitter so I thought a signal booster would help and it didn't.  It's still the same.So I am sure this product would work perfectly for a different kind of living arrangement that the one I am in, but I do know that this product doesn't NOT work.I am considering giving this to my parents because they have their cable split 8 ways so this might actually help, I will update this review accordingly."
1980,"for those of us with skinny arms, it's hard to wrap it tight enough around your arm. You have to have a larger bicey to have it fit snug"
1981,Works with my old and new desktops reasonably well. For some reason it works well with my very old non USB keyboard but will not recognize my USB mouse very well. The MS mouse is not recognized as a MS mouse with either of my MS desktops. Go figure. There are no clear instructions on how to modify some internal settings to configure the KVM.
1982,"I bought this tripod in Dec.2006 and used it a lot until it broke in Jan 2010.Like most other negative reviews, my tripod broke where the flip mechanism rotates and it became a pain to use; leg sliding by itself, not enough height, and I had to used it with duck tape for a while. However, I would like to stress that this tripod produced great pictures with my Nikon D80 and traveled with me a lot, it might have quality problems with the plastic, but it makes up for it with its weight. I doubt I would have carried a heavier tripod as much as I carried this one and it worked perfectly well every time. The head might not be as sturdy as I would have liked, since positioning the D80 on its side sometimes proved too much weight for it. Would I buy it again...maybe, I think overall is a great tripod with some quality issues, if Manfrotto could fix the plastic problem and put a better head locking mechanism it would definitely be the perfect tripod for me."
1983,"I didn't review this when I originally purchased it but feel i need to now.It's tricky I mean how long do you expect something to last.  I bought this in July 2008 and it broke in June 2009 on an Alaskan cruise, something I will probably only do once.  So I got 11 months out of it which is why I give it 3 stars instead of 1.The moral here is always have a replacement.  Filters do get knocked about a bit so they wont last forever but this one just unraveled in my hand when I tried to take it off at one point.  So great up until this point, but then isn't it always the way.  I would probably buy another one to be honest as it did a great job up until then."
1984,"This is a great item for travel, and I love that aspect of the device, however, it is not the best for metro or airline travel. I wanted something that went over the ear, but also great to travel with and this device hit 1 out of 2. Overall, its a good for travel, but sound quality isn't that great."
1985,"Hi guys/girls,I noticed that the first review for this item quoted what I had written in a review on Newegg so I thought I'd clear up some discrepancies between what users have been writing in recent reviews compared to earlier ones.From what I understand of this product, hardware version 2 has no problems in a mixed network. However, from my testing when I bought the DGS-2208 and from D-Link's E-mail support, hardware version 1 shunts all ports to the lowest active connection.My initial testing had been done between two computers, one with a raid0 array on a gaming machine and the other a file server with raid1. Both machines had their software firewalls removed and the connections between the two computers and the DGS-2208 used Category 6 cables. Both machines have EXPI9300PT Intel Nics. Transfer speeds were between 600Mbit/s - 700Mbit/s, per iperf.Adding a connection to a dns caching machine that had a rl8139 chipset nic or to a motorola router, (both 100Mbit connections) the same test before mentioned was ran again , except that the speeds never went above 100Mbit/s. This was not between the gigabit connections and the 100Mbit connections, it was still between the two computers with Intel Gbit nics. After additional tests were ran with the same results I contacted D-Link's E-mail support.At the time, there was not a listing on D-Link's website for this product and it did not have the product manual available like they do now. I emailed D-Link with my iperf results and observations, asking this question:""My question is, Is this switch able to operate at 100mbit and 1000mbit at the same time, or is it limited to the slowest connection present?""A representative responded with:Your Case ID is DLK397875395.Date of Reply: 8/24/2006Products: DGS-2208It is limited to the slowest connection.Sincerely,Jerry HernandezD-Link Technical SupportI ended up replacing all 100Mbit Nics in the remaining computers with rl8169 chipset Nics (Gbit) and replacing the previously used router with one that had a Gbit switch built in (RVS4000). This fixed my issues I was having with the DGS-2208 because there was no longer any connections to it that ran at 100Mbit.All that being said, if yours works fine in a mixed environment, then I'm happy you didn't have the troubles I did. For the person that condescended the first reviewer stating that he doesnt understand how a switch works, the guy was just trying to inform other users so that they could avoid similar problems."
1986,"The sound quality is good as well as the number of inputs. I utilize both optical inputs, one for the DVD and one for the satellite receiver. My only disappointment is that there is no tone adjustments for speaker B. I have outdoor speakers on the patio that require a bit extra bass, but cannot adjust the sound. It took me quite some time to find the one line reference for this on page 42 of the manual. Onkyo confirms there are no tone adjustments for ""B"", but have not responded to multiple messages asking why this receiver was designed this way. It doesn't make any sense to not be able to adjust the sound coming out of a set of speakers. And since I didn't discover this for several months, I am beyond any retrun policy. This is a good buy for the surround, but if you are going to use speaker ""B"", consider another manufacturer."
1987,"For the price Id say its worth it,The only issue I had with it was the fact that the Grounding Cable is very small and I needed to get a longer one. Other than that it's great, I'd still recommend spending the extra on a 4gauge kit."
1988,"What forced me to pursue the purchase of another rolling computer bag was size.  It seems I'm flying on more and more regional jets that do not have the large overhead compartments of regular size jets and cannot accommodate a full size rolling computer bag with thicknesses in the 10"" range.  In some cases, the full size bags will not even fit under the RJ seats because they've grown too fat.  A nice side effect of downsizing was the weight reduction; it forces you to carry only what you really need.  I found that the big 'names' (e.g., Delsey, Tumi, etc) don't carry smaller bags so I was forced to look at brands like Targus, Samsonite, Swiss Army, and Kensington.When I bought it in February, 2007, this Kensington model 62530 had all the features I was looking for.  It is now October, 2007 and I can provide the following feedback after dragging it around for about 60 segments.Pros:- Size and weight - fits comfortably in the overheads of all RJs.  Even when slightly stuffed, it's no thicker than 8"".- Good pocket design and location.  Back section is awesome for all your bulky odd ball stuff like cables, mouse, AC adapter, etc.- Nice built-in carrying handle.- Value.  I paid about $60; for that price, I can buy a new one each year and still be ahead of the game.Cons:- Maybe too light.  Sometimes the lack of substantial weight causes it to spin out of control as you pull it behind you.  Opening the large front pocket can tip it forward if there is no computer inside to provide offsetting weight.- Poor quality zipper handles; they often get stuck inside the pocket they are closing.- The shoulder strap attachment mechanism is a joke; don't even try it.- On my case, the front 'ticket' pocket has torn completely away from material along the zipper creating a cavern between the outside of the 'ticket' pocket and the inside of the material."
1989,"I'd give this 2 stars but I figured that since I still use it, it deserved at least 3.It's supposed to hold the Voyager 510 headset but it sorta fails to do so.  There's no real instructions or demonstration on HOW the headset is supposed to fit in there.  I've been using it for 2 weeks now and have discovered my way to use it and it works for me.  You gotta first of all turn the headset in the right position (kinad in an S shape).  You stick it in microphone first and push on the top where the charger inserts until the microphone sorta pokes out the bottom.  Then it stays in.But there are still many downsides to this.  If you don't have it in right (or like I have it above) it'll have the tendency to spring right out of the carrying case.  Makes it handy if you want it to come out, makes it annoying the rest of the time.  I've dropped my Voyager 510 countless times because of this carrying case, until I found the right way to put it in.  Still, there's no example of even how to figure that out.  It doesn't go in any other way very well and is otherwise pretty inconvenient to use, especially while seated.  I'm an IT person that moves around a whole lot, and so having this headset is vital for me, and i love the Voyager 510.  But this carrying case does not deliver.  The clip is VERY tight on a belt and doesn't readjust.  It's more likely to come off the belt completely.  And if you attempt to adjust it, you're also probably just going to knock the headset out of the case.  It will rotate as well.  Also note, it's stiff to begin with, DO NOT STRETCH IT OUT.Other uses I've found for it: it'll carry two regularly used flash drives very well and secure, it holds my ipod cuz my ipod case broke.  I can fit SODIMMs into it, some sticks of gum and a wad of tissue holds well.  IE, I do not recommend this product.  I don't know of others out there or else I'd probably give them a try, haven't really looked.  I've managed to use this but I don't have a peace of mind knowing that my headset's not going to pop out."
1990,"the backpack is huge but not a lot of room inside.  I thought being a 17&#34; backpack, it would be possible to pack a lot of things in the backpack.....wrong!!  It looks big but in actuality it is just really long in order to hold the 17&#34; laptop.  When you wear it, you look like Michelangelo from TMNT."
1991,"I have just begun using this AV port with the FREE cable. The cable is absolutely useless. Do not buy it if you are depending on the cable. I had my own AV cable (red, white & yellow male ends). The port works. It is a very, poor quality plastic, but works. I'm using it for a Sony DVD player and a Nintendo Wii. I have them plugged into a new Vizio TV with a composite audio/video set up. It works with this set up. It's a good solution for to connect older technology with new electronics."
1992,"I think every today's IEMs are good enough in isolation, fitness, light weight, and even cosmetic looking because these features are much easier to achieve than sound quality.I compared Auvana with PX100. I also used Grado RS1 as reference(not for comparison) to make sure my recollection is right. The Aurvana sounds more articulate than PX100 in mid range. However, Aurvana has a serious drawback in lower bass range. It starts rolling off at around 50Hz. I still can hear 40Hz clearly but it drops too much db relatively to 50Hz so make it sound thin from time to time. Reproducing efficiently at 40Hz and above is very important. A lot of musics reach 40HZ and below but 40Hz is the key point. So Creative mush work hard to  fix this problem next time."
1993,"I bought one of these as a gift but wanted to test it first, so I swapped it out with a cheap Belkin wireless G router currently being used as a switch  ( you only use the ouputs of the router, Not the input on the router and it becomes a switch) . As expected, using the D-Link switch  was a plug and play type thing and worked instantly. However, watching a dvd from my computer to our Asus O'Play at our tv produced a choppy video, as soon as I put the Belkin back in to the system the movie played smoothly.. A movie streamed from Company A Prime to our Roku seemed to be OK. Someone that did not have the two to compare side by side may not see the difference and on devices such as a Tivo where there is a lot of buffering you may not see the difference at all. The switch will be useful for adding a printer or some other device to your home network that really doesn't need the best throughput, but I will not recommend  it to someone that wants to watch movies etc."
1994,This look exactly the same antenna as the other one they sell for like$20 more.. Received this and immediately tried on my hd tv and it worked perfectly...I gave it only 3 stars because it did not  even come with not even a small stand or something.. Otherwise it worked fine even without the stand.
1995,I bought this mouse becasue it was cheap and i thought it would work alright.  I was wrong.  I think i broke this things within a week.
1996,"So I'm torn on this review. I bought this to use with my various ipods, thinking I'd have a nice volume control at my fingertips. Which I do. It is well made (relatively speaking) and sounds fine - volume control (with separate left/right control) works well and is easy to control by feel without looking.The problem is I should have looked more closely at the photo... that cable is LONG! The specs don't mention the length, but the thing has to be at least 10 feet - maybe more. Definitely NOT for portable use unless you want to be tripping over it or have a huge tied up cable in your pocket.It's my own fault for not looking more closely, but this product, while it works well, was not what I was looking for."
1997,"Solid build but does not work with full frame cameras, At 24mm and full frame I get vingetting no matter what I do."
1998,I think this product is well worth it there are some static areas but really overall works great!! Does not charge my Ipod although my cousin bought the same exact thing from a different site and it chargers her ipod which is a different generation than mine??
1999,its good but nothing specialno issure with the working
2000,"I did eventually get this to work with Win7 Pro 64 bit. I'm running this from the front panel header of a GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H LGA 1155 Intel Z77 mobo. The breakthrough came when I went to the Gigabyte website and downloaded their &#34;cloud server&#34; software- which was initially intended for use with their add-on board for Bluetooth and WiFi. After installation of same, I was able to configure and use this device to stream to my server from my phone and vice versa. Keep in mind that a USB cable works far better for purposes like moving large blocks of music into the memory of the phone, getting pictures off the phone, and so on- but the Bluetooth remains very useful for other applications. I was also able to use this without jamming a Logitech Unifying R/T for my wireless keyboard and mouse- also Bluetooth based- so it's a pretty slick little doodad- if you can get it to work."
2001,"The unit was delivered and worked fine, but after a few weeks i bumped the adapter that plugs into the unit and the adapter plug snapped off.The power plug is not as durable as the rest of the unit.Update - found a 2pk 2.5mm male adapter from Radio Shack Cat#274-289 to fix the adapter plug for about $4."
2002,"I have owned this unit for a little over a year and have done some extensive traveling with it.Pros - auto switch between day & night modes is awesome - tough to go back after having it.Battery life is good & cordless option is great.Cons - The mapping software is terrible!  If you have any idea where you are going it will drive you nuts! If staying on the highway one more exit will save you time it does not recognize it.  The directions it takes from my home to office are almost 20 minutes longer!  Having said that, if you don't know where you are going it will get you there just the same!Overall it is not a bad option & way better than a car load of maps.  I just upgraded to a TomTom One & love it.  The mapping is far more accurate but it takes navigating through several menus to switch the screen to night mode."
2003,"This product fulfilled my need to storage space with more than ample, however, it was not as substantial as I was expecting.  It will not last long if it is tossed around in the backseat or trunk of a vehicle.  Also, if heavy items are accidentally placed on top, I believe the case will not be of much protection for my CD's DVD's."
2004,"I bought 2 of these memory card readers since they were so cheap. One works great on every PC so far, the other works on about half of the PCs that I tried it on. So, it is hit and miss. So, buy 2 or 3 to get 1 or 2 that work great."
2005,"These headphones are ok, but their construction is a little flimsy.  The prce is good and they do perform adequately.  I would by them again.."
2006,"I bought these along with the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones a few months ago. Well the Coby ones sucked lasting only a month and the sound was not as good as the Jbuds. The Jbuds weren't perfect but they were noticeably better than the Coby. Also they are quite comfortable and came with extra buds of varying sizes which was great.Unfortunately these Jbuds only lasted about 3 months. Sadly I have come to expect this as I have never owned a pair of headphones/earbuds that lasted more than a few months. Since I only buy inexpensive headphones (under $20) I once took a chance and bought expensive Panasonic Stereo headphones. Those did not fare any better.What I find quite disturbing however is that virtually everyone who has owned these for three months or so, seem to experience the exact same problem almost at the exact same time.Verdict: As I said before, I have never owned a set of headphone that lasted a year (or even close to one) even though I am usually quite careful with my stuff. That being the case, for $10 this is a relatively good purchase."
2007,"I've been using this as a backup to the Canon battery on my Rebel XTi; I've had it for about 11 months.  It's to the point now where it doesn't last very long and doesn't hold its charge if left unused for long periods.At first it had very good performance, lasting about as long as the Canon.  But as other reviews note, performance degrades pretty dramatically over time.Still, it has come in handy enough times when I accidentally let my Canon battery run low that it has been worth it.  I still carry it with me, and occasionally, when I really need to take a shot or 10 and my main battery is down, it pays off.  I never trust it when I'm transferring images to the computer anymore, though."
2008,"Still have the same issue of double and triple key strokes, have to make sure it contacts the surface of the tablet at a perpendicular angle, otherwise you get multiple key inputs.Construction is great and it is easy to hold."
2009,"The coupler works, like other reviews already state the connection isn't the greatest. I have to pull out the cord a little to make a good connection but for my use it works and it was CHEAP. I sure wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this."
2010,"I bought this so that I can hang my new BenQ W1070 projector. I had another more expensive mount attached to my ceiling from my old projector that I really wanted to use but it wasn't of the ""universal"" type and there was no way to match up the mounting holes in the projector and mount. Because this mount is an economy model I won't ding it for lack of leveling controls or other more advanced features found on my old mount. This mount does what it was designed to do, hang projectors from various manufacturers without having to purchase additional parts at a bargain price. However, the base that attaches to the ceiling is really too small and too narrow. After the mount is connected to the ceiling and you're busy making adjustments to align the picture and screen the base loosens a little at the ceiling because of the leverage action caused by the rest of the mount. The amount of the gaping caused by the loosened mount base is small, a 16th of an inch or so, but that translates to big movements on the screen. I folded a small piece of paper and wedged it in the gap so the picture is level and this will probably last until the bulb needs to be replaced but it is a flaw that you should really consider before choosing this particular mount."
2011,"I purchased this to mount my lilluput monitor to my camera rig. The main reason I got this over other options was because of the pivoting ball head, everything else was just a bonus. For what I needed it for the only things in here that were useful were the extenders and the ball head. The x wing attachment broke in about 5 min, the screw mount on it came apart from the x bracket with just a little pressure. I dont know how this could be $39 for list price but for the $6 something its being sold as it a pretty decent deal. The ball head is pretty straight forward but still has its issues. You have to make sure you tighten it pretty good other wise itll droop. I probably wouldn't buy this again but for the initial investment at what it costs it has more than earned its keep."
2012,"Does not fit very well, especially the top row of keys. I have a Penryn MBP."
2013,"I bought these at a different store, in White.Sound is great for headphones under $20.I can wear these for hours.BUT,The plastic cover fell off with in 2 weeks. Then 2 days later the mesh covering the speaker fell off.The headphones cannot be replaced.But they are cheap enough to buy a replacement.Since the headphones can be detached from the microphone, I can also now use any headphone with my iPhone."
2014,"I have had a Slingbox for a year and a half.  After the first couple of weeks setting it up, I used it a lot at my cabin and it was outstanding.  However, after the first year it started disconnecting until now it disconnects more than it connects.  It now also does this on my home local network.  Apparently, according to support blogs, this is common after 1-2 years.  The hardware burns out and you need to buy a new discounted slingbox from the manufacturer.  I give this sytem 5 stars for its first year of operation and 1 star for its second year of operation.  As long as you understand that the purchase is good for only ~ 18 months before you need to replace it, you'll be happy.  If you bought it thinking it would last 5 years, you will be disappointed."
2015,"I have had these for a few weeks and love the sound they reproduce, but I don't care for the piece itself. The shape of the earpiece does not fit correctly in the ear and therefore consistently falls out. Luckily I bought them for $4.99 and not the full retail. Maybe people with siphon shaped ear canals will have a better fit with this. (LOL)."
2016,"The power supply is only needed for SATA drives and 3.5&#34; IDE drives.  2.5&#34; IDE drives are powered by the adapter, not the power supply.  Have used this to clone a hard drive configuration for refurbishing multiple of the same laptops for sale on ebay.  So far 8 drives have been cloned, and they all work perfect.  Used Easy-US Professional to do the clone.I gave it 3 stars because the switch in the power supply lead would not always power on.  Rather than return it, I chose to open the switch.  There was some hard goop stuff in the switch (like old dried grease) that once cleaned out allowed the switch to work fine.  Had to glue the switch housing back together with Crazy Glue.  So other than a dirty switch (which was a quality part once I opened it up, just dirty) it has had no problems.  Been working fine ever since."
2017,"As others have noted, WD should be faulted (and loudly!) for failing to provide a Y-cable or at least warn about this issue in their packaging.  What looks like a tidy little backup appliance (which fits in a safe deposit box) ended up causing a few heart-stopping moments of panic when I first plugged it in.  It instantly shut down my MacBook Pro, then failed to mount or even appear in the USB hierarchy when plugged into a Belkin powered hub.  It finally mounted on the third attempt... plugged into a Targus ChillHub.I'm now torn between actually trusting it with my backup, or returning it.  Requiring a powered hub (and apparently not just ANY powered hub) is unfortunate for an otherwise nifty laptop-oriented product, especially when the only hint of this in the documentation is a comment in ""optional accessories"" that says a special cable may be needed for computers with limited bus power.  A big warning on the retail packaging would be more appropriate.  Their website also mentions this as a footnote:Powered by the USB bus. No separate power supply is needed.** An optional cable is available for the few computers that limit bus power.Other than that, it's sleek, small, quiet, and comes in a very nice neoprene case.ADDED NOTE:  It gets worse.  Disk Utility refused to create an encrypted disk image on the Passport, and during a copy of about 65,000 items it decided to start over about halfway (in fairness, that last one may have nothing to do with this drive, but it has not happened with Lacie firewire products)."
2018,"I have received this cable on time but sadly I was disappointed when I saw the length of the cable, it's 2 feet or less and I thought it would be 3 feet as the standard length of cable in the market but sadly it's not.I bought this cable to hook my phone with the FM transmitter, it's less than 3 feet between the phone holder and the transmitter but sadly the cable it not making it happen so I have to buy another extension which sucks.Talking about the cable quality is good so far but I haven't tested it for longer time so I will be updating this review when I get the extension for my phone."
2019,"Audio is quite quiet when using this with regular programs. The headset it comfortable, but the microphone will not stay where I put it."
2020,"I have a variety of Class 6 Transcend cards as well as a dozen or so from other companies. It's interesting the actual speeds of Transcend's Class-6 cards vary widely. For example, I have two identical 8 GB Class 6 cards that were purchased about 6 months apart. The older one benchmarks (using ATTO-DISK the same software used in some professional reviews) about 50% faster than the newer one.This 16 GB card is slower than both of my Transcend 8 GB cards. In fact it's the slowest Class 6 card I have period. Most Class 6 cards test in the 10MB/sec - 15MB/sec range. This card only manages around 9MB/sec. The spec calls for a minimum of 6MB/sec so it still is acceptable. If you're interested, check my review of the SanDisk Extreme Class 6. It's literally more than 3 times faster than this card (but also costs significantly more).It's also worth noting the SanDisk Ultra Class 4 cards far outperform this card. But SanDisk is sort of in a class by themselves.The good news is if you're just shooting JPG still pics, or anything less than full 1080HD video, this card is probably fast enough. Only shooting HD Video at the highest quality settings on a higher end camera, or shooting long bursts of RAW images on a DSLR, are likely to tax this card.I've also had a Transcend 2 GB card fail and I lost everything on it. While any card can fail, I've not had any problems with SanDisk or Kingston despite using those brands more heavily. There are lots of other reports of people having problems with Transcend cards as well (although some of those are likely from trying to use a card that was too slow for their application). So you have to balance the lower price with the possiblity you might lose everything on the card and the slower performance.Finally, beware everything you put this card in needs to be SDHC compatible. If your PC, device or reader is more than a few years old, it might not be. I know people who filled up their new SDHC card with irreplaceable pics and video, plugged it into their older PC to download the pics, and corrupted the card because the PC wasn't SDHC compatible. They lost everything. If you have any doubt, stay with 2 GB standard SD cards, or test everything before you risk losing anything important."
2021,"These work pretty well, but difficult for a woman with small hands to work with for extended period of time... heavy duty vibrations."
2022,"I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars.  If you don't mind being locked into iTunes, locked into Apple and having to pay $50 for a video cable, then I'd consider this a 5 star product.  However, I do mind.Without repeating everyone else, the hardware is a thing of beauty.  Specifically what made me make this my first iPod ever was the fact that this is by far the most compact video player available, especially for one that can output to a TV or projector.  This was the only reason I left my drag-and-drop, user-replaceable battery Sansa behind.  I'd give my new iPod 5 stars for this feature alone if it weren't for the $50 cable you have to buy only from Apple because they inserted an authentication chip.  I consider that kind of restriction blatantly anti-consumer.In fact, it's that let's-lock-you-into-Apple aspect that has me downgrading my opinion.  Many people will not care, but I still chafe under the necessity of DRM, how I will lose most of the utility of my iTunes purchases if I ever abandon the iPod, the mandatory use of iTunes, etc..  Still, I knew what I was getting into and was willing to overlook these little uglies.  I can even understand how some of those measures were perhaps necessary to placate the recording labels, but the authentication chip and $50 price tag for the video-out cable was definitely not a necessity.  I guess Apple was sick of being undercut on video cables for the last-gen video iPod.  For $20, I'd be happy.  For $30, I'd shut my mouth and take it like a man.  But $50 for a cable that they are in essence telling me I cannot buy elsewhere?  Sorry, but for me that's more than just a blemish on something otherwise so pretty.On the other hand, to those who find that their generic USB chargers do not charge their iPod -- this is not a scheme from Apple to force you to buy their stuff.  After reading through the newest USB specs, I believe Apple is just following the new standard which specifies that the two middle USB pins (D+ and D-) on the charger should be shorted together.This is how all future USB devices are supposed to instantly detect that they are connected to a charger and not a hub or computer USB port.  Most older and/or generic chargers do not comply with this spec and the newest iPods will not recognize them.  Even Apple chargers made for the 1st-gen Shuffle do not work with the newest iPods for this very reason.  So if you're buying a USB charger for your iPod, make sure it supports the newest models.Also, I've found the player to be somewhat buggy.  For instance, my iPod will sometimes not let me adjust the volume level if I don't exit the song first.  Some album art shows up in iTunes on my PC but ends up as a black box on my iPod.  I expect future firmware updates will correct those bugs.  I also wish there were some way to scroll through files faster.  I have some files (like lectures) that are an hour long.  Trying to fast-forward to a spot near the end of the lecture is a frustrating exercise of thumb-spinning.  Many of my previous MP3 players allowed me to just hold the FF button and the longer I held it, the faster it would forward.Overall, I'd give me iPod 5 stars on hardware.  I knock it down to a 3 or 4 because of unnecessary or anti-consumer product restrictions."
2023,I bought it but soon threw it away.  Not loud enough to hear on a bike.
2024,"This GorillaPod is a good choice for small cameras like a DSLR with a small, light lens or a GoPro -- but it's an awful choice for heavy lenses like the 70-200mm as pictured with the item on Company A.  If you have a heavy camera, you really can't have the legs all the way up, as they'll creak and come lose, which topples your camera over.  But, if you bend the legs up at the bottom and have the camera close to the ground, it will stabilize it.  As far as wrapping the legs around something, forget about it with a DSLR -- but it's perfect for wrapping around railings or similar with a GoPro.  It's not excellent, but it imperfectly fills that void between trying to balance a camera on a surface or lugging around a big, heavy tripod."
2025,This is a great little tool.  Nice to have a brush and cloth in one thing and it fits nicely in my camera bag or just clipping it on the strap of my camera.  I only with the brush end had some sort of cap.  I always feel like the tip of the brush is getting dirty just by being exposed and something's going to attach to it and then I'm going to brush it on my lens and scratch it up.
2026,"Bruch and cleaning pad work well.  Cleans lenses really well, however after carrying around in my bad for about a month, the cap that does on the little pad end won't stay on anymore.  It's lose and will not stay.  Still have it as a backup, but have since replaced with http://www.Company A.com/gp/product/B0081ER9KG/ that I'm liking better."
2027,I love it that you have easy access to your camera and gear from this bag. I did have to do some major reconfiguring to get it to be more useful. The way the bag sits is a tad bit uncomfortable for a woman. I wish these people would get a clue about that sort of thing.My only complaint with this bag...BLACK. It comes in no other colors and has no distinct personality. I am 'doctoring' mine up so it looks at least a little 'girly'.
2028,"Ok. Let's just get it out of the way right now: yes, it is cool, yes the Unix-based operating system is good. Yes, it is virus-free. In other words, it has a lot of things that other laptop makers can't claim.And yet: I have had mine 8 months, and increasingly, I have to end sessions because I get the ""spinning beachball of doom"", indicating that RAM is being hit (i.e. is processing and I can't do anything). I went into the Apple store and they told me it was not spyware, but ""you have too many sessions open at once"". And yet, it happens when I have one single session open. To be fair, I am not 100% sure that this is Apple's fault. It could be something else that I don't see right now. But it didn't used to happen. I hate ending sessions with the ""beachball of doom"".Another issue is battery life: for instance, I often leave my MacBook with 50 % power. When I turn it on the next morning, it is dead and I have to start back at 0 %. Why ?Battery life seems to be the achilles heel for Apple, on most of their products.Thus: 3 stars."
2029,"I own the space pilot and it is wonderful, this is just too light and lifts off the ground when I use it."
2030,"It worked as promised and was easy to install.  I have a co-ax, hdmi, and power supply running through it and couldn't fit anything else.  It looks a little cheap when finished and couldn't get pieces to match up perfectly.  Spend a little extra on a nicer brand or run the wires behind the wall if possible"
2031,"It's a cheaply little thing. Does the job but no frills or electronic thrills. I pulled from both ends and it got stuck. Don't try this at home,"
2032,"I don't like the keyboard layout as well as some other models.  Also, the screen isn't as bright as my 3 year old HP was.  Also, the glide pad isn't as positive feeling as some I've had.  This is my 5th laptop in 10 years.  It's all right, but I wish I'd have held out for a Sony or maybe even a Mac.  I don't like Vista, but that's not the computer's fault."
2033,"i would have given 5 stars but the hole saw that came with the camera caused some minor damage. WHY? i was drilling and the bit broke out of the hole saw causing the teeth to run astray. otherwise $30 for a reverse camera thagt has decent quality i'm content with the purchase,"
2034,"Sound is good, though I have a set of Altec Lansing ALS44's from about 2001 that sound as good if not better.The ""dock control center"" is really just a power button and dial volume control on a ""dock shaped"" thing-a-ma-jig. The left and right speakers are hard wired to each other via the plug, the dock is hard wired to the subwoofer, etc. It was impossible to run the cables where I wanted to because of this.These are my first ""slightly more than basic speakers"" from Logitech, and likely my last. Though the sound quality is decent, the cable management options really frosted me."
2035,"My only point of comparison are Canon cameras just so you know where I am coming from.  I was trying to decide between this or the Canon SD1000.  Finally, I decided on this because of cost.  After using this camera for about 2 weeks, I should have bought the Canon.  The handling of the camera is decent but there are just too many buttons and cheap, unnecessary features.  The smart touch works well but I prefer the old wheel found on most cameras.Overall:Pros:-many features for the price.  7MP-looks great and well built-awesome high resolution video mode-the viewing screen is bright and high resCONS:-the shutter lag is just horrible-larger than the canon.-too many buttons.  interface is not simple."
2036,We bought these to work with an AT&T DSL Router but it would not carry the signal.  It does work as a basic phone extension.
2037,"It was larger than I thought, but  I can still use for my needs.  I wanted to hang off my belt when I was camping with the Boy Scouts."
2038,"5 Stars for the Sound, this is one of the best sounding Desktop speaker, have used this for 2 years. It always brings excitement whenever I plug my audio source to the speakers. It has convenient front & back inputs also front headphone out. In spite of all these, one thing that will annoy and kill your patience is the volume knob, after few months, it stopped working properly, from then on, I always had to fiddle with it, to bring sound to both speakers otherwise one side will cut off, it is so annoying I had to remove 2 stars from it, because this alone takes your excitement and when everyone is set to listen or watch, you'll be wasting time with the volume control for good 10-15 mins. At high volume, this speaker will crack, up to 80% of its hardware volume will be excellent, after that it will rattle little bit. Recommendation, sadly not that much, volume knob is not simple annoyance, its ongoing experience, and its not worth it, but if you have all the patience in the world, you'll be rewarded with good sound."
2039,"I have had no issues with this card. With a speed rating of 4 the transfer speed to the computer will not be a quick as a speed 10 card. Other than that, I have had zero issues with this card, works quite well."
2040,"I purchased this unit after trying two JVC products specifically because I wanted certain functions. After extensive research, I found that this device said in the product specs that it would do everything I wanted.Here are the functions I wanted:1. Bluetooth integration (including voice dial).2. Ipod integration.3. XM integration.4. Control of unit from factory redundant controls on steering wheel.While technically the unit does all of these, it performs quite poorly in some areas.  I have decided to keep this unit, but it's a Hobson's choice. Frankly, I have been unable to find a unit that does all of them well.Keep in mind, in order to do a lot of these things, you need to buy a separate breakout box or adapter that is not included in the price. Here how it did in each of these areas:1. Bluetooth integration. OK at best. Call quality is fine. It also accessed and played music from my bluetooth smartphone. Where it suffers, though is voice dial integration.  Basically, although you can initiate a voice dial call from the unit, there is a bug in the Bluetooth stack in the Pioneer unit, and, because of this bug, you cannot hear prompts from you phone telling you when to talk or asking you to confirm a selection.  Pioneer says ""yep, we have this problem"", and ""nope, we're not going to fix it"".  I have made a work around by disabling all voice prompts on my phone, but I still have to guess when to talk, and if the phone gets the wrong voice tag, you don't know until the wrong person picks up.  This issue really is annoying if you rely upon voice dial.  There is also no dedicated hard button to turn on voice dial that can be accessed no matter what mode the unit is in.  You instead have to get to the phone screen & then trigger a voice dial.  The JVC KW-AVX800 does a vastly superior job of bluetooth integration.2. Ipod integration. Quite good, but has a rough spot or two. While the menu tree could be better, it is vastly superior to the JVC.  It does sometimes loses time sync with my latest generation ipod nano, but it recovers quickly.3. XM integration. Very good. Nice displays and easy to navigate.  My presets do sometimes disappear from the preset list. What I mean is that the slot for the preset would be there, but the channel name would be missing. This happened with my JVC unit much more frequently, though.4. Control of unit from factory redundant controls on steering wheel. Good. I wanted to be able to control basic functions on the unit from the factory steering wheel controls so I would not have to take my eyes off the road. It works reliably, but every tap on the buttons brings an audible ""bing"" from the unit.  This can be annoying when you are changing the volume.Finally, although navigation was not something I cared about, since it has nav, let me talk about it:  it is incredibly sub-par.  I have used a Garmin Nuvi unit for some time.  The navigation experience on the Garmin is just vastly superior.  First and foremost, the Garmin is just MUCH more accurate.  The Pioneer seems not to recognize things like turns as well.  Second, the Garmin's maps are preloaded.  Each time you want to navigate on the Pioneer, though, you need to remove any cd or dvd you have in the unit & put in the navigation dvd.  Cumbersome.  Finally, and for me unforgivably since it would be a simple software fix, integration between an ipod and the nav system is poor.  Unlike on the Garmin Nuvi which pauses music or book on tape content when the navigation system gives you a directional prompt, this unit does not.  This means when the unit tells you ""left tern ahead"" and then 5 seconds later ""turn left now"" and then ""proceed for five miles"" you miss a lot of the thing you are listening to & need to keep rewinding.In the end, I'll keep it because it does most of what I want at least passably well.  If I was relying on it for navigation, though, it would definitely be a reject.Finally, the product descripton says it has ""15GB"".  I'm not sure that it has anything like that.  It certaily requires you to use the nav DVDs, so I think this is a misprint."
2041,"The real issue I had with this TV, which I returned, was the inability to brighten shadow areas.  For those of you not familiar with LCD screens, many small ones have a very little dynamic range -- in other words, they tend to push shadow areas into total darkness.  You won't notice this in the store, since most of the carefully chosen video is of bright, sunny scenes like hot air balloons and afternoon baseball.But when you get the set home you'll notice darker scenes, especially in movies, are virtually unwatchable.  I spent two days trying to adjust the brightness and contrast, but finally had to admit defeat.  Now if you're just buying this for the kids to watch cartoons, you'll probably be ok.  It's a beauty in a kitchen.  The touch buttons on the side are also very cool.  But it just didn't work in our bright kitchen.  We went for the 20"" Vizio which allows adjustment of the backlight (which will probably shorten its life!), and is much crisper, overall.  But the Samsung sure looks cool.  White TV's are rare, which makes it even more of a shame the picture was so mediocre."
2042,"I purchased this in December 2007, and it came with a standard one year warranty.  After 17 months, the picture died.  The set would still turn on and I could hear the audio, but no picture whatsoever.  I got it fixed at a cost of $294 (new motherboard needed).  Fortunately, VISA paid for the repair, under their free one-year extended warranty provision (check with your credit card issuer to see if it's a feature of your particular issuer).This TV will display a great picture with HD content, but for whatever reason, the video from my 480i/p DVD player (a Sony) looked terrible.  The sound is merely ok.  The design and finish is outstanding; this TV looks great just sitting there.  I'm hoping I can get many more years out of it without any more repair issues, but it's discouraging to see that so many owners have had issues with this set."
2043,"HD is actually only 150 gig and my older Maxtor drive that is only 4500 rpm has a faster read/write speed.  Price point is good,other than that its just ok.Update-speed may be related to the fact that the drive died on the third day.  Seagate support is not great, return (even after only working for 4 days) is at my cost. Gave up on phone support after 10 minutes on hold, on chat was unable to provide any technical support, just said to return item.2nd update-Seagate was very good about replacing the disk, but the replacement disk only worked for about an hour before it died also."
2044,"The camera body is very good. The lense looks properly aligned as well. However, I noticed anistropic chromatic aberrations prominent esp at the edges. Thus unless your subject is right in middle of your view, you might see aberrations on sharp edges. However the product is very good and for a amateur its recommended."
2045,"I tried to install this Modem two months ago. The wizard connected it to the computer but not to AT&T; my ISP. I checked D-Links website for support at that time and found that most of the pages didn't even display correctly on my computer. There was very little information on this sparse site and most of it said, contact your ISP. At that time I was too busy to spend an hour on the phone so I put off using it.I tried to install it again tonight. I can tell you that my computer interacts with this modem just fine. I can also tell you that AT&T; was willing to tell me how to make it work with their system. They call this service Tech Support + and they will gladly connect you to it FOR A PRICE. Do you really want to buy this and THEN spend $50 to talk to India??Having endured marathon tech support sessions before, I was not into sitting with a rep and going over the entire process (most of which I know) while the clock clicked off my dollars. Just finding the tech support number at AT&T; took me about 15-20 minutes because the NEW AT&T; site has become one big ""sellathon"" partnership with Yahoo.If anyone can comment and give me the AT&T; settings for this box it would be much appreciated. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is having this problem."
2046,"This set was a good deal.  The Wall adapter rattles and is not UL listed which makes me distrust it.  Car adapter is solid.  USB Sync cable is a godsend.Pros: affordable, USB sync locks in making it so it doesn't disconnect during syncingCon: non UL listed, Wall adapter rattles"
2047,"The unit has plenty of good points as others have pointed out.I'd like to point out flaws that may matter to you:- if you use a computer with a DVI to HDMI cable, or an HDMI video card, the SR875 is not able to display the picture properly (it will be blocky and with the wrong color). There is no known fix from onkyo except plugging the cable in your TV if you have more than one HDMI input in your TV- as others have noted, the unit gets very hot. It has no active cooling and will burn up in a cabinet (it has also damaged equipment that people have put directly on top of it)- there is some problem with 1080p component video, at least for Xboxes, and the unit will convert component 1080p down to 720p and then back up to 1080p hdmi (losing quality in the process). This makes the 875 barely better than the Denon 3808 which cannot display component on its hdmi outputIf the first 2 points are a problem, it is recommended that you look at the Denon 3808 which doesn't have the video problem with dvi/hdmi, and also adds ethernet, internet radio, firmware upgrades over the net, controls over a web browser, and usb  reading for music."
2048,"This skin is has good protection and gives you a good grip on the phone - much better than the slippery phone by itself.  Overall, I enjoy it.  But, the skin picks up every piece of lint and dust that comes near it, so I always find myself having to wipe off (with water) the gunk that gets on the back of the cover.  I wonder if anyone else has this problem?I've washed the case a few times with soap and water, and it has stood up to that."
2049,"It is important to note that I was NOT EXPECTING these to sound like a high quality speaker set.  However many people who reviewed them portrayed them as on-par with much more expensive speakers.  So, before you attack my review please understand that.  Look at the title ""You get what you pay for.""  My only point is that people should not have unreasonable expectations for these speakers based on the positive and over exaggerated reviews.The sound is very basic.  Bass is slightly overly-punchy and the high range is a bit dull and quiet.  Not bad for a $50 pair of speakers.  But don't be fooled by all these reviews.  You are getting what you pay for."
2050,"After using this Arctic Silver 5, I didn't see the noticeable improvement, the CPU fan roaring as usual, still very noisy!"
2051,"2 year and 11 month update: Adjusting from five stars to three stars.Less than three years after purchase, the touch screen on this device became non-responsive. At first this was an intermittent problem, and then it became permanent. Neither a software update nor some techniques discovered online (holding down the power button to reveal ""pre-boot"" functions) resolved this.I consider three years the minimum lifespan for a piece of technology like this. Crack the three-year threshold, and no harm, no foul if it stops working. This GPS didn't quite make it. I like Garmin's interfaces and functionality. While I'm replacing it with a newer Garmin model, any future Garmin purchases will depend on the replacement's status in 2014.This GPS was well cared for, and sometimes went weeks in the house without exposure to the harsh car interior environment.Company A now offers a beta ""trade-in"" service on qualifying electronic devices, and this model qualifies. I simply self-assessed it's condition, printed out a pre-paid return label. The resulting  $28 dollar gift card credit to my Company A account will ease some of the sting of the replacement GPS:-)-------Original reviewIncredibly accurate navigation; user interface is mostly intuitive and and user-friendly. Excellent, bright display (that automatically dims and changes contrast at dusk/dawn). Used at length from the mid-Atlantic to Ottawa to El Paso, and it has rarely suggested a wrong turn (and recalculates and recovers nicely when it does).Minor interface issues:-There is no map scale indicated (except in the ""turn details"" view and when browsing the map, such as after you enter an address).--Although manually entered ""favorite"" locations will accept phone numbers as part of their data set, you can't do so at the time you enter the name and address information. Instead, you have to repeat your steps to return to favorites, and then enter the phone number.--When connected to a Vista machine, isues with Vista and current browsers; close the error messages and you should be fine (the blame here almost certainly lies with Vista anyway!).These are minor annoyances that detract little from the overall usefulness of this device.You can't go wrong with this unit if you don't need Bluetooth.Less forgivable:a carrying case, printed manual and household AC adapter should have been in the box from Garmin (and in these days when GPS units are high theft they should have considered a friction/beanbag mount too...avoids the telltale ""high value item was stored here"" notification circle on your windshield.You can't go wrong from a technical point of view, but leave a little room in your budget for the extras you'll probably want."
2052,"Power cable is not 8 gauge.  but as the other reviews say it is what it is. I purchased this as a trial/test kit to make sure I could get things hooked up correctly in a new truck.  Wasn't sure if I could get audio from the stock head unit or not. So I did not want to get a whole lot tied up in the investment if it wasn't going to be possible. I found out I was able to get it working, so the purchase was worth it. I will be replacing the power and patch cables down the road. the strans of wire are super thin and break easily. However, if you're on a budget and using a low power amp then this should work just fine.  I wouldn't expect it to last for more than a year before corrosion eats them into dust. Also, the fuse appears to be a one time deal.  there is no way to open it to replace the fuse if blown.  Also the connectors/accessories are not gold plated as shown in picture nor are they big enough."
2053,Good fit in my car but the color and texture doesn't exactly match the dash.  Climate controls sticks so some modification had to be done.  Screw holes can easily split.  Head unit support bracket is made of plastic but is strong enough.  Overall a pretty good product.
2054,"This thing was a royal pain to install my components in. I hope you have small hands cause i do and they barely fit.  Keeps things cool but nothing spectacular. Bottom chassis design makes NO sense at all to me.  Why have your main input fan pull air at the bottom of the case when it's isolated from hot cpu and video card above?  I suggest putting the input fan in the front middle and put your hard drives in the middle as well. They stay cooler that way.  Two out of the three fans don't start to rotate unless i spin them by hand!!!  Who has time for that?  They do start if you put them on medium but this is supposed to be a quiet case so people want them on low.  I put retail antec tri-cool's in there and they work fine.  It is quiet but NOT silent as some have said.  If you want quiet buy an accelero fanless vga cooler and get an aftermarket cpu heatsink with a tri-cool fan set to low.  Many other reviewers love this thing but I just thinks it's OK and not as good as your hoping for.  Overall I do like the case, the way it looks and it has room but save yourself some money and get something cheaper."
2055,"I bought this for my new digital camera.  It is too slow. On occasion, my camera will blink red and freeze.  At first I thought it was a low battery, but after further research I learned it was the memory card.  They are not all made equal!  It turns out they are rated differently by class, or MB/s, according to how fast they read/write.  This one has no class rating, and should only be used for storage where speed is not an issue."
2056,"This was a birthday gift for my 18 year-old daughter.  I haven't actually had the opportunity to use the camcorder but she is pleased with the size and ease of use.  She has said that the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired though, even when played through a TV or computer.  Perhaps she needs to fully read all directions to find out if there is a way to correct the problem.  More on that later....."
2057,Works well for an economy priced cable. Have had no issues or failures on all 8 cams. Pain in the ass to unwind from factory winding.
2058,"A disappointing purchase. If you don't know anything at all about traveling, the TomTom will get you where you want to go. But if you are familiar with most of your travels and want to ""plan"" your trips, the TomTom isn't very ""user friendly"" for changing routes . . . though it's not impossible to do so. I assume the higher quality GPS systems are better?"
2059,"I have had Altec Lansing before, but this isn't as good as the last one I had.  It quite frankly was weak and didn't have the sound that I wanted to have while sitting at my computer listening to music.  I ended up giving it to my son going to college and will be looking for something better."
2060,Good for expanding USB ports when in dire need but if you're going to use this steadily at home consider buying a USB extension along with it so you can hide your cords behind your desk (or wherever you hide them).
2061,"Compact and fits perfectly in my laptop bag without adding bulk or weight.So far, this unit has performed nearly flawlessly. The only complaint I have is that the ports aren't *quite* as solid as I'd like - I've had devices attached that have come just a little loose. They look plugged in, the indicator on the device (a card reader) is lit - but the connection isn't there. I've learned to press the connection in a bit better if the device misbehaves. If I plug the same reader directly into a laptop port, I don't have the same problem. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.Update on 8/18/2011: I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars, because it suddenly quit working."
2062,"If you plan to use this unit's built-in ATSC tuner with an external antenna to watch over-the-air HDTV, note that it does not pass HD signals through unmolested. Instead it ""downconverts"" 720p/1080i to 480i (in preparation for DVD recording); then ""upconverts"" back to HD resolution for output. This can be a serious deal-breaker for certain prospective buyers (including myself) who do not have one of the newer HDTVs with built-in digital tuner, and are not on HD cable. All current 2007 high-end DVD recorders with ATSC tuners have the same problem (Panasonic / Sony). Hopefully new 2008 models will correct this."
2063,Bought this for a friend who wanted his first wireless mouse. The biggest drawback is the size of the receiver. Also when dropped will come apart into 4 pieces but not broken. It was a good as a gift but not for me.
2064,"These speakers are cheap, so don't expect too much. I am using them on a computer that isn't used for any real music/video playback. They look pretty nice and have a regular plug instead of a large adapter."
2065,"at beginning, the plugs fit tightly. then they lost tight fit. i had tried some other brands, it seems this problem is common. I didn't try expensive one though."
2066,"I purchased these speakers for my TV. They are not made for a TV, but were advertised as being so. They are computer speakers and wouldn't work properly with the TV. I tried to find out if I needed special cables, but was unable to get an answer so returned them."
2067,"For the price, it sure keeps my droid 4 going. Until it stops working. I wonder when I'm gonna buy #3.Update: #2 didn't even last a year. Trying something else now."
2068,"My employment puts me behind the wheel daily, and I use the charger frequently. Most of the time they last around 6 months, and then its difficult to keep them in just the right spot to charge. I understand these are cheap, but I've had one that didn't last 2 months before, and I expect a little better from supposed authentic Motorola equipment (buying from Company A). I bought extras to keep as backup, and I'm glad I did...Expect 3-8 months of life if you use this often.I would almost suggest finding a good charger, and throw this to the side to use as a backup, or one to grab and take with you in a friend ride. If you lose it, you didn't lose much."
2069,ok for charging your micro device with this but I changed to a double connector since I had to charge more devices
2070,"I'm disappointed as the title said ""rapid"" charger and its definitely not that. I use my Samsung Galaxy S III in the car for navigation (duh). I was hoping keeping it plugged to this charger will, at the very least, MAINTAIN the level of charge that I had when I got into the car, even if not charge it up fully as I drive. No such luck. My charge kept going down. I had to switch the screen off so the charger could charge the phone up  a bit so it wouldn't go completely dead."
2071,"It LOOKS like a Motorola product, but didn't LAST like a Motorola product.  I had it for about a year before it died.  For the price, that's not at all bad."
2072,"You're probably not looking at this product for the extreme high sound quality, so as a value solution this is a 3/5.  I'm using it to hook PC sound to a monitor with built in speakers on the rare occurrence that I'm not using headphones.  If the wire is twisted correctly sound quality is reasonable, but if you give a 1/4 twist in any direction, there is constant feedback until you reposition it.  It's not a bad solution if you don't move your components, and for the price you really can't go wrong.Edit (4/9/13): When I mentioned the price I should have probably mentioned, I paid about $1.50 including shipping when I ordered."
2073,"Item was delivered quickly, shipping was a little high. I still had to purchase a Linksys range expander to get the needed signal increase so I would recommend just buying one to start with."
2074,"Added 101508: Firstly, thanks for the comment about Transformers. I got this and the Toshiba HD-DVD player at the same time and it seems I confused the software.and now: I am now on firmware version 1.9. The only remaining nagging problem with this player is that if you leave it on PAUSE for more than 5-minutes, you are dumped out to restart from the beginning... all of the waiting while the disc interacts (usually about 60->80 seconds), and ads and FBI warnings... Samsung has so far ignored owners' please for a fix.Other than that, this player sends great video and bitstreamed audio excellently.--------------old review below------------------------Despite having to go 3-tries at a working unit (as always, Company A's CS has been fantastic replacing each faulty item), and despite some minor and some major glitches in operation (slow load times,  and some video drop-outs, some audio drop-outs and even locking up on specific Buy-ray Discs) this is a marvelous piece of home theatre equipment! Firmware upgrades are quick and easy via ethernet (and hopefully Samsung will continue to upgrade since this technology is so new). The HD sound (Dolby DIgital Plus, Dolby Digital TrueHD, & DTS-MA) bitstreamed to my Onkyo 805 is amazing! As is the picture... Ratatouille, Surf's Up, 300, March of the Penguins, The Departed, Sopranos Season 6, and many others have fantastic video picture on my SXRD-60XBR1! Try it, you'll be impressed! But if the glitches bother you, return it..."
2075,"The auxilary cable itself works just find, but the problem is the retractable feature.  The second day I used it, the cable inside the roller got all tangled.....I played with it for awhile and got it back on track but it keeps doing that."
2076,"It took me a lifetime to set up the mount using the extension rod. Setting up extension rod was not easy and the instruction manual is useless. I had to call product support of VideoSecu to set it up. I was on the verge of sending it back, but finally after an hour of effort I could assemble it.Also it says universal (so it should fit with any projector). I had to use so many combinations to get my epson projector mounted on this bracket. also I had to use some combination which I wasnt comfortable using it and for first few days I was scared if my projector will be on floor in the morning, but looks like its holding it so far :)I hope it works fine."
2077,"I bought this with the TomTom 920 - the pad is great, it's very heavy and very high-friction. I've had it at a 45 degree angle and it still won't budge, even when I'm driving.The problem is that the beanbag ring around the pad where you attach the suction cup is taller than the TomTom 920's included suction mount, so there's no room for the TomTom itself, unless you angle the screen up, over the ring. The screen ends up angled so high you can't see it.The only way around this is to get a new mounting kit for the GPS, or to buy a different pad. I'd recommend this pad if it fit the TomTom, however - it works great, and fits in my glovebox despite being big."
2078,"I had problems with mine freezing on start up right from the get go.  I updated to the newest firmware 2.0, unplugged it over night, reset the clock numerous times and every other trick I could find in the forums.  Had it worked I would have kept it just for the beautiful job it did upgrading regular DVDs.  After a week of trying everything I returned it for a refund.Like any electronic device occasionally you get a bad one."
2079,"well, I bought a M9, so its battery was claimed to be on the light side. I need a replacement.Though there are OEM options, I decided to spend the extra for the Leica brand."
2080,"My old Seagate 500Gb died and this was a direct replacement.  I restored an image on to it and it works, just noisier than my original, but it works!"
2081,Wish it had a screw to hold it to the wall.  Keeps pulling out of wall when removing a plug.
2082,"I've had this mouse pad for a few months now and I'm disappointed with it because it's supposed to be 'high quality' and 'gamer quality' but the edge of one side of the mousepad has already begun 'curling up' and coming apart.I'm left wondering why I was charged $10 for this $1.50 mouse pad...An item this inexpensive isn't worth the trouble of returning so I'll just suck it up and use it, however, I'm feeling as if I got the short end of the stick on this one."
2083,"I really like the comfortable built-in palm rest and the curved contour of the keyboard layout.  But the other stuff I'm not too fond of.  If the keyboard were cheaper, I could overlook it, but as it is, I have mixed feelings.F1 through F12 have custom functions assigned to them (eg F1 opens Microsoft Word) but you need to hold down Logitech's ""Fn"" key or else it will act as a regular F1.  I find this very annoying, especially since for most users they rarely use the function keys, it would've made more sense to have flipped it, so that ""real"" F1 required Fn+F1, whereas F1 alone would load Microsoft Word.  (Of course, the best is to allow case by case flipping for each key in a control panel).  This is a moot point though, because actually the entire design is antiquated conceptually.  If you are using Launchy (for Vista) or Spotlight/Quicksilver (for Mac), you can easily and quickly launch most applications with a few keystrokes already anyway, and from the comfort of the regular alphanumeric layout, without having to reach for the distant Function Keys row, which, even if convenient, would still require a lot of memorization and retraining to remember which keys map to which applications.Another thing that irks me is how they changed the layout of the Home/End;Insert/Delete;PageUp/PageDown buttons.  The new layout looks good on paper (eg by horizontally aligning Home/End) but doesn't work in practice for many people, including myself.  I could explain why but I doubt most people here would want to see several hundred words on how touch typists receive useful cues from certain arrangements and not others.There are several extra buttons included with the keyboard, and while these are nice, they're rarely useful and take up a lot of space.  Zooming?  I do that like maybe once a week.  It's certainly not important enough to deserve a separate button on the keyboard, not when ""Control Plus"" and ""Control Minus"" are easy to remember and hit shortcuts.  There are also some media buttons-- one opens up Media Center, another opens up Media Player (talking about Vista of course), and so on.  But the fact of the matter is that, again, to make efficient use of these, you would have to memorize their location so that you can reach for them blindly.  The media keys are even farther than the function keys, making them even more irrelevant in practice.There are some other notable buttons-- Document Flip (causing 3D Flip on Vista, Expose on Mac) and Gadgets/Dashboard.  But they are only marginally useful too.  The Document Flip button for example isn't so great on Vista because Win+Tab is usually easier than reaching for the separate button on the far left.  And of course, a lot of people have the Gadgets sidebar on constant display because their widescreen monitor can handle it, destroying the need for a button to show/hide it.  I could go on, but you can probably begin to see that for an experienced user and typist that a lot of the buttons are useless cruft.It's not really THAT bad a keyboard.  Again, I like the ""wave"" (though it may take a few weeks to fully get used to) and the palm rest.  And there are a few minor tweaks I like, such as the oversized escape button.  The ability to disable or warn the user for Caps Lock, Insert, and other rare modes is also incredibly useful.  But most of the stuff is kind of frivolous if you are a proficient typist who has a decent app launcher like Launchy or Spotlight.  General conclusion: Buy it for the ergonomics, but realize that you are buying a bloated piece of hardware that is probably a bit more expensive than it has to be."
2084,"I have more than 10000 pictures on my computer, and it is nice to be able to see them at random.This frame is very nice, easy to load pictures, just connect to a PC and drag and drop the pics you want.The image quality is good enough.I don't need the video, or audio or wireless stuff, maybe later.But I have to return it, the most important feature I expect from a DPF is to display images, and display them in the right orientation, not sideways for vertical pictures.All pandigital DPF do not read the Exif data embedded in each picture and  don't automatically rotate the photo to the correct orientation.I was instructed by the nice (no irony here) customer support to do it manually, like going to about 4000 pictures one by one and rotate them, when my computer can display them correctly without issue.Well other brands can do that, so I'll just return this one and order something else."
2085,"I've used Logitech mice for years, even decades. Two years ago I bought an iMac with a wireless Mighty Mouse which has been so much trouble I decided to replace it. Now there aren't many bluetooth mice out there, and there are n't any at all (except the Apple) for desktops. I bought this one because of the great price and recommendations.It's roughly the same weight and volume as the Mighty Mouse. Not as long but sits higher. But the problem is that it is hard to use. It takes more pressure to click than any mouse I've used, and the shape simply doesn't fit my hands at all. It also seems really cheaply constructed. Time will tell how it holds up, but that Mighty Mouse is starting to look better.Added after 4 months of use -- thin rubber-like coating on the sides is peeling off. Clicking is still difficult. I went back to the Mighty-Mouse for a couple of days, but ended up back with this. I'm really not happy. Maybe I need to dig out an old wired Logitech mouse out of storage. They were quality!"
2086,I bought this for my tv to connect to my pc.I have a good set of computer speakers with a sub woofer and they would sound good with the signal from the tv.When i connected them i got a terrible buzzing sound out of them.I dont think they are shielded and thats the reason why.I will have to spend more on a good set.
2087,These are MUCH better than the paper sleeves for vinyl records.  But their are definitely better ones out there.  The corners have a hard time sometimes when putting into the album cover.
2088,"This is a great camera and overall big step in improvement when it came to revamping the body for more durability as an update to the 30d.  I also thought that the ""Live View"" was way overdue and wrote that as a major complaint for the 20d, and 30d.  I wonder why it was that cheap sub-$100 canons had live views whereas a $800-$900 camera (at that time) didn't.  It opens up so many more options to give the user the ability to have that when they want it, for example taking pictures at a concert when you have to lift the camera over your head.  But the one thing holding me back from not giving this camera full kudos is that it's still relying on a sensor that crops your image. The same image that's taken w/ a 35mm film camera and this one wouldn't be the same.  This also changes the focal length of lenses and you need to do some math to get the right focal length, other than that there are some lenses that compensate for the cropping factor of this camera.  The only digital slrs that have the full frame are the 5d and up.  Those cost a little more.  I think canon should think about converting most of its digital slrs to full frame, as the technology's out there, so why are they holding back?  If you're spending this much money on a DSLR, you should be getting your money's worth. Other than that, a very nice camera."
2089,i personally don't like this enclosure it is cheaply made and the power connection is very loose and faulty
2090,"Reading the glowing reviews here, convinced me that the proprietary Sony of old had finally learned its lesson, with improved user interface (the Minidisc interface was horrendous), and no proprietary music management software (the SonicStage software effectively ruined the Minidisc). The machine itself is a joy to use, the sound quality is great, and the battery life is astounding.But then a throwback to Sony's proprietary ways reasserted itself - the USB cable, which is also used to charge the device. It is Sony-specific, which means that the device can only be loaded and charged from a PC with the Sony cable attached. So, unless you buy extra cables (I don't know if there an power adapter available), you are effectively grounded to the one PC. For me, given Sony's history, this restriction was reason enough to return the unit. Shame, because it has the makings of an iPod-killer."
2091,"Weak & Broke after a WhiLe, If Not carefuLL w/ HandLing !!!"
2092,"It's doing fine and On/OFF switch and firmer bendable wand would make it better. I have both the usb fan and this light for my laptop so I'm comfy and not disturbing others at any time of day or night.UPDATE: Sad to report myUSB 10 LED Light Lamp Notebook Laptop Computer PChas finally DIED. It was a slow death though... it wouldn't stay lit unless propped in certain positions THEN in only ONE POSTIION. When I started to see little electricity arcs in the clear USB connector - a short of some sort, I decided ""no more"" for fear it would impact my notebook. Just in time because the light no longer works at any position. Lived SIX MONTHS... not 50,000 hours and I hardly used ya!"
2093,"I bought the flip slidehd and used it for a season, once the battery died out I could not use it anymore, so I'm stuck with an expensive paperweight and charger and stand that i cannot use anymore.  I was using this product for my public speaking class in school and some video with the church and my daughter.  but now the battery wont charge anymore and when i call they they sell or repair the slidehd.  Unfortunate for me as well i cannot fix it myself either it has to be sent end and no one will repair it.  this is horrible, no one told me that they were going to be dicontunued and that no one would repair them.  SO I'M STUCK"
2094,It works fine.
2095,"i love the way this player is supposed to work but it freezes up from time to time, and more then once i had to format it because it randomly got corrupted. the features and menus and great the price is good and it has never left with without music. however with using random with a big play list the screen will freeze so you can not skip a song for about a minute then it will jump ahead 5 songs because you pushed the button more then once. still a better product then most of the competitors but needs a few problems addressed"
2096,"Apparently such a simple setup is very hard to do. Easy to install, but the audio quality left something to be greatly desired. Static, buzzing, and over-amplified volume."
2097,Sometimes it goes bit stupid and although it's powered - there would be no audio if it wasn't - it isn't charging.  But if you leave it powered all the time this isn't an issue.
2098,"In the 3 weeks of owning the Zune MP3 have not been able to evaluate this package. If the event arises later to make a sensible opinion will do, until then adieu!!!"
2099,I've purchased several of these because after a few months it stops working on my phone. the phone just cant read it or recognize it after awhile. I dont know if its the card or my phone so i dont think it would be fair to give it a lower rating. I will be buying another brand next time to see if it is the card or my phone. I mean if you have to keep buying new ones then you end up spending way more money over time then just buying a better brand. So we shall see.
2100,needed it bought it as cheap- problem packaged with tablet when web site said separate packaging so that an issue
2101,"Picked this up after I bought slingplayer for kindle fire and my old slingbox wouldn't work with it so Best Buy had it on sale for $130.Piece of cake hooking it up to my Comcast box with the component cable (r,g,b cables). The picture is much sharper on all devices including my kindle fire (which my old slingbox wouldn't work with this new app. Its great to have access now to all my portable devices (iphone, fire, ipad) and the picture is definately better now.UPDATE: Broke less than 6 months, but Sling sent a new one with a box and sticker for the new one to return. I got a buddy one too in Sept and his died already (2 months) and they are sending him a new one too. These things should last longer. The original that I got in 2005 lasted 6 years."
2102,OCZ Ram always is cost effective to me. Price point is usually spot on and usually no problems running them.
2103,It was a great monopod for about two months and then I found it constantly shaky and having to readjust the legs. Do not recommend to anyone looking to do professional work. Makes for a great point-and-shoot monopod but that's about it.
2104,You would think that for the total of $17 I paid for this stylus that it would work exceptionally well. But actually this stylus is not better than the free stylus that came with my case. This stylus is only slimmer and longer. In my opinion this stylus is not worth the money.
2105,"my default software is able to play the videos that are captured with this unit, so I didn't need to install any additional software of drivers. I just put the card in my card reader and everything is there. You do HAVE to connect the unit to your TV to set it up. There is a built in menu that must be setup before you can use it. You can set it to record all the time or motion sensor. You can even set the times it should record if you know who or what you want to check on. The setup is a little confusing, but not too difficult. Once it's setup, it works really well. I set it up for motion sensing recording. The videos are just OK quality, about like most inexpensive surveillance cameras. If you know who you're looking at, it's easy to make out, sort of like a cell phone video recording.The unit is a little bigger than I expected, so it's not really ""hidden"". If you have an alarm system in your home, with motion sensors mounted inside, you can mount this and people might think it's just another, larger, sensor.If you're concerned about personal property, or need a nanny cam"", this will do the trick. I just think it's expensive for what you get."
2106,Doesn't fit the ipod perfectly. I had to make some adjustments because earphone jack is covered almost a quarter of the way. Overall it fits great on my arm.
2107,"The bluetooth feature is definitely difficult to use.  There are buttons everywhere and it's not as easy as opening up the box and knowing how to use it.  Takes a bit of reading.  I like the dimming options, and that it has a lot of functions.  I got it for a cheap price at the time, so it does the job."
2108,"I know this product got many, many good reviews, and I would agree with the majority of the ones I've read.  However, there are some design flaws that should be addressed by the manufacturer.First, the brackets that actually hold the TV (the ones attached to the back of the television) rely on only three things to stay on the wall mount: gravity and two small bolts that screw upward into the bottom part of the mount.  It's a very poor design because the bolts don't actually screw into anything, such as a hole or a nut.  The flat end of the bolts simply press against the flat surface of the mount.  I don't believe this will hold the TV from sliding left and right over time as the bolts loosen, and as we push and pull on the sides of the television to change the angle.Second, tilting the unit up and down is very awkward, and is obviously not designed to be something you would do often or quickly.  There are two brackets which allow for tilt.  Unfortunately, they are difficult to access and adjust.  On each bracket, one side is held by a bolt that has a sliding hand turner for tightening.  This would be fine except that it is in such a tight space that it is slow and tedious.  The opposite side of the bracket does not even have this.  It has a nut and bolt that must be tightened with a screwdriver and a wrench.  This means you have to pull the TV quite far away from the wall - or lift it off the mount completely - to change the tilt.  Again, very poor design.There is definitely some sag to the unit.  We noticed as soon as we mounted the TV.  The top sits about 3 inches farther away from the wall than the bottom.  Our TV is only 96 pounds, and this unit is rated to hold 165 pounds, so it is not all that it claims to be.Other than that we are happy with it so far.  It does seem fairly sturdy (beyond the sag), and we love the amount of swivel and how far out from the wall it comes (although I would not recommend extending a heavy TV to the full 19 inches it is capable of).Overall it's a good value for the price we paid (about $70)."
2109,"All of the comments when I bought this said how sturdy it is.  I put my 60"" plasma on it and it sags more than I'd like.  Maybe it's not possible to make an articulating wall mount that can support that kind of weight?  I just try to keep the TV as close to the wall as possible and don't rotate it much."
2110,"The material of the armband is good, but when the IPod is inside of it, somtimes the touch screen does not recognize the ""taps"".Bye."
2111,"It worked for a while, did exactly what it was supposed to do. Then it stopped working as well. There was a short in the cord where it plugged into the laptop."
2112,"I purchased this radio along with a Home Installation Kit about a month ago. My main intention was to listen to college/pro football games not carried here on the West Coast.Use in the car has been excellent with no problems except a short loss of signal while in a tunnel.However, use at home has been less than stellar. Apparently, the 'satellite' is located in the central US and supplemented by a ground based antenna on the East and West Coast. I have two home kits with one installed in a west facing upstairs window and the other in an east facing upstairs window. Reception is sporadic. In general, the signal is fine for about 1/2 to 1 1/2 hrs and then fades out for about 1/2 hr. Unfortunately, this seems to happen in the 4th quarter of a close game and every day around sundown. I'm happy with the progamming available just don't like the interruptions. If the signal was steady at all locations I would have rated the system at 5 stars."
2113,"It doesn't stay in tune as you travel around, Stations become more static. Pretty bulky. Should be charging the device as it plays."
2114,"The only reason I am wary is that the fan has yet to come on .  Upon booting  , u see the fan tweak about 3/16's of an inch 4 or 5 times , then it is still. It isn't warm to the touch , but I personally would rather have on that the fan was turning as a peace of mind indicator that the product was in fact working , other than that ,  it seems a darn good deal for the price."
2115,"Got this product because my Asus Netbook doesn't have TV-out.  I used the RGB-to-RCA connector.  Picture quality streaming Netflix to a 5-year old 42"" Panasonic EDTV Plasma TV is a bit rough; very washed-out but can't expect much more with compressed video over the Internet, converted to RGB, and then to RCA.  I haven't tried it yet but I expect playing a DVD on the Netbook would be better quality.  We had borrowed a Nintendo Wii for a short period.  Streaming Netflix using the Wii is much, much better quality.  But, it's $200 more :)"
2116,"i received this in the mail slightly broken, but nothing i couldn't fix,once i placed it where i wanted it, it looks and works really good! the camera is pretty darn good for the price."
2117,"Sound is great for such a small device. Great for music around the picnic table. Compact design. BUT, the on/off switch is horrible. Poor design and function."
2118,"I was hoping to use this to get some data off an old hard drive but it doesn't seem to work on my home built old PC.  I tried it out on two other PCs and it worked fine.  No idea what the hangup is on my system, but it's useless to me if it doesn't work where I need it.Still, if you have a reasonably modern setup it should work fine.  Speeds will be only as fast as your USB (1.0 or 2.0 only) but for copying and doing basic stuff it should be fine."
2119,"The problem is that this device has an OPTIONAL USB plug that connects to your computer telling your computer that the power was just disconnected and the timer starts counting and when it reaches the predefined remaining battery power limit, it sends a signal to your computer via USB to tell the computer to shut down. It's this feature that has caused my computer damage and I've had it verified by a local computer repair shop.Somehow or another, a power surge caused this device to surge the USB port and thus damaging the USB connection to the motherboard and now I am unable to connect any USB devices to the computer. I still love this UPS device and will continue to use it but my recommendation is that you don't use the optional USB plugin. Windows already comes with power failure software and though it's not near as good as the one that is provided to you on CD with this device, it is sufficient. I am assuming you're using windows, of course.I only run the computer, the monitor and my external hard drives through the master outlets on this UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) device and I am able to run all systems with a full black out for 36 minutes. That's pretty damn good if you ask me. 99% of the time, the power to my home will turn back on within that time frame but when it doesn't, Windows will shut down for me but doesn't shut down my external hard drives, unfortunately, so I have to be sure I turn those off when I go to bed, just in case.Something failed in the USB connection from this device to my computer and I'm not sure why it failed but it did and it damaged my computer. So, I took a star off for the failure and another star for damaging my equipment. I realize there will be people who disagree with me but the truth is, as with a lot of hardware and software, it's very difficult to sift through the variables of what COULD have went wrong but I've never experienced anything like this before until I hooked up this item. I could be wrong and so could the technician at the store I took it to, but in the end I have no way of verifying 100% that this device caused the problem. Then again, nothing is ever 100%.Other than that, I love having this thing because I get a lot of ""brown-outs"" here in Texas as the weather seems to be sporadic at times."
2120,"Overall, its a great mouse.  In our setup at work (we have 5 or six of them), the receiver is on the back of the left monitor, and the mouse when used on the right side, has some reception issues.  While range may reach 8-10 feet, truely reliable range is shortened to about 24 inches.  It jumps around and is succeptible to interference.Three stars for good tracking/solid surface reading, good button action, and a very comfortable grip.  Minus two because if the computer doesn't know you did it, you might as well not have a mouse at all!!  The reception is the most critical function of the mouse!Nice, comfortable mouse.  But I'd probably look into some of the newer designs with the higher frequency receivers."
2121,"These speakers are about 6.5 inches tall and 2.5 inches wide, so they are quite compact. The fact that they do not require a regular electrical outlet for power and don't need a mini-jack (headphone style) cable for audio input, makes for an economy of cords and wires to use the speakers. This is the primary advantage to this type of USB plug and play speakers, and this set does that well. Also, setting them up on my old MacBook Pro was a snap. All I had to do was go to ""System Preferences"" and select ""Sound."" In that menu, I chose the ""Output"" tab and selected ""USB Audio"" which appeared on its own as soon as I plugged in these speakers. That's all it took. No ""drivers"" to install or download for the Mac, but I don't know about the PC world. That's it for the physical dimensions and set-up of these speakers, and they score well in that category.Now let's talk about what it is we bought these speakers for in the first place: sound. At this point these speakers merit a negative and critical review. The sound is not good. They are fine for talk radio or strict dialogue type media, but as soon as a user needs audio reproduction for sound effects or music, the quality drops off a cliff. The sound is tinny and cracks on even moderate bass-lines. There is little depth to the sound they produce and they offer no subwoofer outputs. Worst of all however, is that there is almost no volume control on the speakers themselves. There is a huge gap from the zero sound level to the first click level. As other reviewers have noted, the best way to maximize sound control is to use the slider toggle on whatever program you are using for the audio/video application itself (like iTunes), rather than the (-) and (+) signs that the speaker set sports on their bezel for volume control.Bottom line: These speakers are easy to set up and fairly portable; they are also fine for spoken media, but not well-suited for music or videos at all. Are they worth the $11.50 I paid for them? I dunno; maybe.And I think that says it all.Thanks for reading me!-CL"
2122,"I am returning the Cavalry 500GB external eSata enclosure.  I had it attached to a SA8300HD (Scientfic Atlanta HD DVR) and I had frequent playback glitches - once to serveral times an hour the video would pixelate/skip and the sound would drop for a second or so).I expect this drive would work great as an external drive for a PC, and it comes w/a complete set of hardware to attach it to just about any setup, but it isn't working well with the SA8300HD."
2123,"Seems fine but I didn't get it to work. More than likely its the computer, its very old. I don't know pin settings for the laptop."
2124,"The specs on this notebook are better than any comparable ones I have found anywhere for $1500. The screen is great, its fast, powerful, has blue ray, and lots of TV tuner stuff I didnt need.What I didnt like..........I happened to get a new one with defects. The internet explorer locked up daily which is not cool. There was also a rattle inside the case on the left near one of the hard drives, that rattled when typing or using the touch pad (which was very good. Not too sensitive.)The internet explorer would lock up daily if the unit was left on in any mode for more than a few minutes. It wasnt a virus or anything I installed. It was probably a vista problem but I never could get it to stop. The screen also dims way too much when unplugged. Not a good feature! The battery could be at 100% but the screen would dim regardless as soon as it was unplugged by some 30%. Made it very difficullt to see. There was included a lot of TV tuner stuff thats really not needed. I wish they would remove all that uneccessary TV stuff and work on the screen dimming.I reaaly liked the notebook. The problems I had were immediate, streight out of the box. There was no replacement available so I had to return it. I must have gotton one of those 5% thats defective. It sucks but it happens. I havent seen any reviews that have had similar problems so maybe its an isolated problem.Overall, the notebook is a great buy......but with the screen dimming like it does (lenovos do the same thing), the problems I had with it brand new, it still gets a 3 just for the specs. and performance. Its almost a perfect comp. as long as you take along the plug.Ill probably buy another one!"
2125,"I bought this unit to be able to add some SATA devices to an older computer for a client and it does work well with decent transfer speeds. Not sure that the IDE connection is worth anything anymore since pretty much everything has gone SATA, but if you need it it's there. My issue with this device is that the internatl SATA connectors are not exactly the strongest things in the world. When I installed the device, two SATA devices were connected to their slots and I had no problems. The issue happened when one of the connected devices failed and needed to be removed from the system. When I attempted to remove the SATA cable from the PCI card, it took the entire SATA connector off of the card rendering the port worthless. I know it's not the cables fault because I immediately removed the 2nd cable from the port, put the 1st cable on the remaining port and it did not pull the connector off. Maybe I just got a faulty port, but the card still works with one connector left. Buyer beware."
2126,"My title says it all.  I ordered the exact model number my tv required (there's a sticker on the side of my tv that lists the lamp part number). I tried to use this as a direct replacement, but it would not push all the way back into the same place in my tv where the blown out lamp was.  So, I had to unscrew the new bulb from its housing and place it in the old/original housing.  After that, everything was smooth and the tv was working again.  This should have been a five minute job, but was more like a hour hour.Its worrisome that this bulb is only rated for 2000 hours.  At 8 hours a day, that means this bulb will last only 250 days!  My original bulb lasted 7 years!You may be asking why my tv is on 8 hours a day? My wife works at night.  I work during the day. We both use the tv at different times.  8 hours is a estimated guess anyway."
2127,"I didn't realize this camera took xD cards. Ugh. To get good movie mode, you have to buy M+ xD cards. M+ xD cards max out at 2GB, limiting the movies you can make. Given that this camera is for water use, I don't want to be swapping out memory cards in the water!Also, the power recharger is a corded model. I'm probably just spoiled with Canon and Panasonic cameras that have a recharger pack that just plugs right into the wall. No cords.Will not buy Olympus again, but for a used camera just over $100 that can get wet, it was pretty much my only choice."
2128,"I purchased this to be the camera I could finally just stick in my pocket or pack and be gone.  No other has been able to take the abuse.  And it's very, very good, including features and optional on-camera guides to effects.The problems have to do with use as a travelling camera.  One cannot download pictures without their special computer to camera cord.  Looks like a mini-USB, isn't, and you can't take pictures and process on a friends laptop without dragging that around also.  When one is travelling light carrying the cord is a nuisance.  It's in the way and weighs.An out would have been having an SD card instead of their proprietary memory card.  Their card cannot be read by anything found in the course of normal human events.  Bluetooth would have been nice.Great item as long as one wants it only for short jaunts and doesn't plan on processing any photos without dragging along that proprietary cord.  Or a reader of some type for their memory card."
2129,"This is a good player except for a couple things Sansa changed in the software that runs it. In the E280, I can go forward and backward through the lists, past Z to A again, which helped a great deal when I have hundreds of artists and albums and thousands of songs. That is, I could backward from A to Z, Y, X, W, etc., or I could go from W to X, Y, Z, A, B. With this player's software I can't go past the end (Z) to the beginning A and start over. If I'm at Z, I have to go backwards through the entire alphabet. This really sucks. I wish this player had the E380 software.The delete function is moved from Music to More and is harder to get to. This sucks too. Once again, they should have kept the E380 software.If you don't need 32 GB, I'd recommend the 8GB E280 instead."
2130,"There are several features about this unit that are very good but just as many or more that are not so good. It is very accurate and it holds the satellite signal extremely well. The color display is very good although difficult to see well in bright sunlight. The unit is very ""power hungry"" and this is probably why the brightness is limited. It is also why the unit is designed to power up with the display very dim. It is brighter when used in the vehicle if plugged into the power outlet using the optional adapter.I use the unit primarily for hiking and geocaching and I really like the geocaching features especially the ability to go ""paperless"". I do not like the method of entering notes or coordinates into the unit. Instead of the displayed letter, number and character wheel, a virtual ""keyboard"" display would be much easier to use even with the same controls. A system similar to the Delorme PN-20 would be much better. Geocache files are handled differently than waypoints. One cannot delete geocache information from the unit but must connect to the computer to manage geocache files. Waypoints can be deleted individually directly from the unit without the computer.A word of caution: the base map files and preloaded Topo files are all combined into one large file which is NOT isolated or protected and can be deleted accidentally very easily. Be very careful!Road routing is excellent with the optional City Navigator software.One does not have an option for sorting geocaches or waypoints; default is by distance. If one knows the name or GC code, a search can be done fairly easily. It would be nice to have the option to sort either alphabetically or by distance.Although the Garmin Colorado is quite functional, it is far from the unit I expected. If I could return it now, I would do so. Then I would buy the Delorme PN-40 which will be available later this month."
2131,"Not much to this Dash Kit. Just a couple of pieces of injection molded plastic. A little effort was needed to make it fit well and in the process of tightening the mounting screws, I found that the parts are rather soft plastic. Be careful with that. It is also not quite as aesthetic as I'd hoped. I have to admit that by the time I got to installing the head unit I was tired and simply happy that it all went together well and easily."
2132,"I gave this to my mom for xmas 2007, it broke last year. So, if you are planning on keeping it for a while, better get ready for it to break in 4 years. It did great while it was working, but then one day, it just quit. We did not opt to get it fixed, so I am not sure how it broke, but it worked great while it worked."
2133,Key issues are the LCD read out for the volume level on TWO of the ones I dealt with were unreadable for the second digit. Like for volume level 33 looks like 3&#8801;.  Simply said the second number is garbled. I took out the memory hold battery &#34;watch battery&#34; to test if and when I went to reinstall the little tongs that connect with the battery inside the unit got all bent up with the slightest of a push. With the replacement I got I didn't bother pulling the memory battery. But I have a feeling that if the unit lives long enough where the battery dies replacing the batt is going to be a disaster.Side note I noticed the warranty said it was for &#34;portable audio&#34; So joking here don't mount it or you void the warranty.  I read all the reviews and most of the issues people were having looked to be user error or expecting more than what you get for the money.  I didn't want to buy a Sony product but this one was the one Mom wanted. I have stayed away from Sony since the mid 80's and when I did have Sony cd players back then the CD mechanisms physically didn't last more than a year on every one I bought.
2134,I bought this item for my digital camera. It works really well and really fast. I would buy another with no reservation.
2135,"Just as it was tough sharing your popcorn--or your favorite toy--when you were a kid, it's often tough to share USB devices between multiple computers without constantly plugging and unplugging cables. Kensington's ShareCentral(tm) series of devices aim to make sharing printers, hard drives, memory cards and virtually any other USB peripheral a tad less painful, by enabling one-button access to any connected device from any two Macs or PCs.The ShareCentral series comes in three flavors, according to the number of USB peripherals they're capable of sharing. The ShareCentral 1 ($39.99) shares one device between 2 computers, while the ShareCentral 2 ($59.99) shares 2 devices. I'll let you do the math for the ShareCentral 5 ($79.95). Each comes with a power adapter and the necessary USB cables to connect two computers to the unit, helpfully color-coded orange and white in an attempt to head off any possible confusion that might be encountered during the connection process.The rear panel of the unit provides one USB ""A"" connection for each peripheral it's capable of supporting. Since I was testing the ShareCentral 2 model, there were two USB ports to which I could connect my devices: my trusty but dated Olympus digital camera, and an 80 GB USB hard drive. I connected the ShareCentral to my 24"" iMac and my MacBook prior to connecting my peripherals, and plugged in the AC adapter. On both Macs, the Keyboard Setup Assistant appeared instantly; it seems OS X recognizes the ShareCentral(tm) as an input device. I dismissed the assistant on both machines and it did not reappear in the course of my testing.With my USB drive and camera connected, the unit worked as advertised, allowing me to mount both the camera's memory card and the hard drive on either machine with one button press. Kensington thoughtfully provides alternate button covers with icons of typical USB peripherals, so instead of pressing button #1 or button #2, you can swap them for buttons with printer, scanner or hard drive icons, in order that you don't have to ponder too deeply about which peripheral is cabled to port #1 and which is on port #2. The unit seemed to switch from one Mac's USB bus to the other quite rapidly, as there was very little ""lag"" between ejecting the devices from the first Mac, pressing the button to switch them over and seeing them mount on the second Mac.That being said, I think this device still has a few rough edges in a number of areas. First off, the top panel on which the switch buttons reside has orange LED indicators to show which device is currently switched to which Mac or PC. But for some reason, the LEDs for computer #2 occupy the entire left and bottom border of the panel, while the LEDs for computer #1 occupy only the top of the panel. Further, neither indicator is labeled as computer #1 or #2, so the user is forced to guess which is which based solely on the relative position of the indicators. It would have made far more sense to put #1 and #2 LED lights on each button, so that it would be clear at a glance which computer each of the peripherals was currently switched to.Using the included ""custom"" buttons helps the user remember which button controls which peripheral (as long as your peripheral device is a printer, scanner or USB hard drive). But there's nothing to assist one in divining which strip of LED lights represents computer #1 or computer #2; can you guess which computer is connected to the printer and which is connected to the USB drive? Answer: They're both connected to computer #1. How do I know that? I had to go back to the instruction sheet, and then look at the connections on the back of the device one more time, and even then I wasn't 100% sure.My primary beef, however, is with the instructions--or lack of same. Although there was no shortage of 4-pt. legalese on the included instruction sheet, the setup and connection info itself did not provide a single word of explanation--information on setup and use was provided solely in the form of line drawings with supporting arrows and icons. I could certainly see many a user becoming befuddled over how the connections are supposed to be configured, especially given that the computer #2 connection is located on the left side of the device and computer #1 on the right, which to me seemed backward from the get-go, and when combined with the bizarre configuration of the LED indicators, only added to the confusion created by the lack of any written explanation.Step 1A of the instructions did indicate that the user should insert the provided CD, which I assumed contained a PDF manual and possibly driver software. I was half right--there was no manual in sight, but there was a folder labeled ""MacDriver_x86"" which contained the ZIP archive ""Kensington_Share_Central.zip."" Again, no Read Me, no PDF, no indication whatsoever as to what I should do with this file. Assuming it to be a driver for the device, I double-clicked to uncompress it, upon which it created a file on my desktop called--not surprisingly--""Kensington_Share_Central.""The Finder's ""Get Info"" window revealed this file to be a Universal application, so I went for broke and launched it. No Dock icon appeared, nor any change to the menu bar indicating that the software was running. A quick check via Activity Monitor showed an active process called ""Share Central,"" but there was no way to know what it was or was not doing, and no way to quit it. If it actually was a driver for the ShareCentral, or something else entirely, I'll never know. Whether or not it had anything to do with the ""Auto/Manual"" switch I discovered on the bottom of the unit will remain another of Life's Great Mysteries, as the instructions did not make even a graphical reference to this option.The mysterious ""Auto/Manual"" switch on the ventral surface of the ShareCentral 2. What does it do? Should I leave it on AUTO or switch it to MANUAL? Can I switch it while the devices are connected, or will that create a rip in the fabric of the space/time continuum? Will Luke and Laura ever get back together again? Don't leave me hanging like this...I'd like to give the ShareCentral high marks for doing what it claims to do, but the woefully inadequate attempt at an instruction sheet, the confusing layout of the device, the lack of any electronic manual, the mysterious ""is it a driver or isn't it"" software on the included CD, and the even more mysterious and completely undocumented auto/manual switch on the bottom of the device all point to a lack of care and preparation on Kensington's part. For my $60 I expect a more polished product, with functioning driver software and far better documentation than Kensington has chosen to provide.Sure, it's nice to share, but I feel that anyone who makes use of this device will share my opinion that Kensington has some more work to do here in order for the ShareCentral to earn its $[...] price tag.[...] Rating: 3 out of 5"
2136,"GPS is OK....but often sends you the 'long way'.  It added a couple of hours to several legs of my 3000 miles trip.  I tried the ""Fastest Route"" and ""Expressway Only "" routes with the same results.  You need to know the route and have a rough idea before going....then, it's OK.....Just don't use it blindly..... For $150.00 though....it's not bad...I think most GPS's have this type of routing issue"
2137,This is a little radio that can! It is easy to carry around (if you need to) and produces clear sound. The solar panel seems to be working well - I have not cranked it at all after receiving it and it always have sufficient power to run on.I only wish it has digital tuning...
2138,"I needed a new tripod, so after much consideration i went with this one.  so far it is a good buy for the price.  It is fairly solid but a little flimsy.  I have used it with my canon rebel xsi and my small sony hard drive cam corder.  it works well with both.  I'm not sure how i feel about the removable base though.  All in all it's functional and for the money i would recommend it if you don't want to break the bank."
2139,"Several people have pointed out that the charger in this kit did not work with their iphone or touch.  The technical notes on the product description mention that it's only for the 1st gen iphone and touch.  I missed that note when I purchased the combo kit so I'm out of luck with my 2nd gen touch.The screen protector is fine -- applies easily and works as expected.Another reviewer complained that the leather case is smelly -- I can attest to that.  I cleaned mine with an alcohol based solution for a while and it helped a lot.  I'm sure there's something better for leather but I didn't look.  The smell is almost gone after a couple of days of use and isn't getting on my hands anymore.Last note:  A couple reviewers complained that their ipod touch crashed when in the case.  My 2nd gen has already crashed a couple of times when I closed the lid.  Apple says that shouldn't happen from the small magnets in the cover, but I still think there's something to it.  If that happens, you'll need to press the power and bottom buttons at the same time for about 10 seconds to reboot.All in all, it's a mixed bag.  Very inexpensive, but in this case worth pretty much what you pay for.  I think it's probably a good deal for 1st gen products, not so much for 3g/2nd gen products."
2140,"I was in a store with intention to purchase the camera. I did lots of research and despite the lack of multiple reviews on this product and higher price than competition decided to purchase it. I spent god knows how much time in the store playing with it and taking multiple shots. I even brought my own pro duo memory card in case i needed to analize the quality of pictures later.What i can tell is the camera is decently built and feels solid but not comfortable to hold, the grip was small and cornery. Also where the thumb is suppose to support the camera there is zoom control, so you unintentionally hit it every now and then. Browsing among multiple menu options almost drove me nuts. I usually figure out any device in minutes, i`m tech savvy, so to speak. But this one is unbelievably tricky. I lost track of time and space trying to figure out simple things like adjusting ISO, sharpness, contrast...etc.And then taking pictures in the distance with a full zoom i was wondering about the perfomance of the anti-shake sistem. What can i say, I`m disappointed. Most of pictures came out blurry. I put in another SD card that i had in another camera and those pictures came out rather sharp and clear. I intentionally don`t tell another camera`s name. Having come home i tried to read the memory card with Sony pictures and my computer failed to read it... For the price these cameras are for sale now this is not a bargain. Just my humble opinion."
2141,"I ordered the Peerless PT660 because it was guaranteed to fit my 46"" TV, which it did. Overall I am happy with it; however the design is not without flaws. I have used this wall mount in a recessed space in the wall. The recess is about 5 inches deep and it is very hard to reach behind the wall mount in order to secure the 2 screws that hold the TV to the bottom of the bracket. The tilt mechanism works fine once the TV hangs on the bracket; however the bolt that secures the angle is hard to reach as well. May work better on a flat wall but I think there are wall mounts out there using an easier design. Some reviewer's had problems with the tilt function but that part actually worked well for me. The sturdiness of this wall mount is very good."
2142,"This is a great GPS mountable vent clip on deal, but the long plastic clips that go into the vent are a little too fragile and can bust easily, so you have to be super gentle with it.  I wish mine didn't break so easily,  I had it for a few months before the clips broke off."
2143,"The one that Garmin sells (&#34;Garmin Air Vent Mount&#34; is the item description) for $19 is much better quality.  This one broke within a month's time.  I did order a replacement because it's good to have a backup.  I think the kind that mounts on the air vent is a lot less distracting, and doesn't move all over the dashboard."
2144,"This is identical to the controller that comes with the ps3. It works as advertised. All the comments from other users regarding the ergonomics of this controller are spot on. It's familiar and works fine but it needs an update as far as comfort. And unfortunately it has the same stupid lower triggers as the original ps3 controller. They essentially took a ps2 controller and removed the lower plastic strip that supports the l2 and r2 triggers causing your finger to slip off of them when the action gets intense. I haven't seen any other controllers out there with blue tooth, dual shock, and the ability to charge via usb. So for now I guess this is it...:]"
2145,"I have had it for a few months, and used it in several international flights.  It does some noise cancellation, by which I mean one can certainly feel the difference when the switch is turn on or off.  However, the engine noise level still remains pretty noticeable when the switch is on.  One has to increase the volume to get a better result (just perception wise).  I might have been expecting too much when buying this item based on some of the reviews, and consequently got a little bit disappointed.  I will have to come to terms with the headphones as I am unwilling to pay $300-600 for other brands that are supposed to be much superior."
2146,"Awesome idea, and my girlfriend's works great.Mine arrived broken. It probably plugs in and works fine, I haven't tried, but the wall socket is supposed to rotate and mine won't. And to be useful, I need it to be vertical. I've pushed and pushed to the point I think I'm going to break something off. I'll revisit this review if and when the issue gets resolved.But I imagine my experience is not normal. I generally trust Belkin products."
2147,"While I love other Belkin products, this surge protector with dual USB charging does not provide me with the capability to charge two things at once. That is why I ordered it! Honestly, this is my 3rd or 4th try at finding one charger that lets me charge two things at once and none of them seem to work right. I'm keeping this surge protector because it has a good guarantee for protecting your equipment. But, if you're hoping for dual charging, this isn't going to provide that. I plugged two cell phone power packs in to the USB ports and nothing else. These packs are 2600 mAh each and it just sat there and blinked. It charges one at a time fine, but not two!"
2148,"What they don't show: a small spacer must be inserted on the bottom to keep the plug parallel with the wall. In my case, that spacer  broke. I have fashioned a substitute, but it's not a very good design.  Also, these usb ports will not work for a device like the ipad that requires 2.5a USB ports."
2149,"I bought this as I wanted to not have to use the adapters when charging my iPad/iPhone and this works well for that. However, since the plug is on the side of the strip, it becomes awkward because the weight of the chargers pulls it down. It does what it's supposed too, but definitely needs a better design."
2150,This thing sounds very good and is very easy to set up. It's a shame that Sony didn't throw in a learning remote since my DirecTV remote can do more than turn this on and off and change the volume (I'd like to select different inputs).
2151,"As my first upsampling DVD player this unit has an excellent picture and seems to be able to play any DVD we feed it. Unfortunately the lack of lighted buttons on the front panel or the remote makes operating this unit in the dim light of a viewing room difficult. I'll definitely pay attention to this feature, or lack thereof, in future purchases."
2152,Pretty chincy cable overall but to be honest for the price I couldn't expect much more. It's fine for home use but would not recommend for anything other than that.If you wanna walk around your living room but are too cheap to by wireless headphones then this will do it.
2153,"Great idea, but the suction cups don't stay very well.  Since I occasionally need to travel with my laptop, I can't use the adhesive pads."
2154,"i bought this prior to the one i am using right nowi guess price shows how bad/good a product can be sometimesi had seen the reviews and thought i should try this but was a bad decisionthis didnt last at all,it worked pretty well although the sound wasnt that good"
2155,"Short & Sweet:-I bought these for my audio-technica ATH-M50 headphones, influenced by a thread I found on lifehacker, and, of course, the positive reviews here.  But mainly because the stock pads hurt my ears a bit, only because I think they are a little small for my ears.-Definitely not worth ~$22, more like $5-10, tops!-They are lacking a bit in the plush department, as another reviewer mentioned.-However, they are a bit softer than the pleather pads I replaced with these.-They do make an improvement in my case, but mostly because I feel like my ears fit inside these better than the previous pair.-I can't attest to a wider range in sound as another review stated, and I wouldn't try to because it's a highly subjective matter.In summary, I'm glad I got them because they make my headphones more comfortable by fitting my ears better.  However, if you have more time on your hands, I'd look around because I'm sure you can find something similar or better for a much more reasonable price.  Don't justify this expense because you spent a lot on your headphones.  These are low to medium quality at best with a high quality price tag, IMO."
2156,"After using Garmin GPS systems for many years, I decided to buy the 730T Based on features and bang for the buck. I love the display and actual navigation......however, here are my issues:1)Loses Bluetooth communication with my phone often and needs to be reset through reset hole in bottom.2)Has few POI's, and the majority of thm are in the wrong location, and I mean WAY off, sometimes miles.3)You can make all the map corrections and add safety cameras you like, but even months after uploading them, they are not in your unit.4)All the updates remain on the computer an can not be transferred to the unit even with a 4 gig additional card. Only option is main memory and it is filled with maps.5)When you sync the unit it generally crashes and has to be hard reset.6)After you arrive at a destination, you must clear route or the unit keeps trying to get you back to the same point.7)It takes 3 screens to clear a route.So next time it's back to Garmin. I have had 4 Garmin units and while I do prefer some of the TomTom features, the Garmin is more up to date and accurate."
2157,"I bought the TT 330 XL as my second GPS. The first is a TomTom G0 910 which has been great.  The plus of the 330 XL is that it has most of the features of the GO 910 - the features you really use anyway.  The minuses of the 330 XL are:#0 TomTom Home application is poorly architected.  TomTom Home can only talk to 1 GPS.  So, because I like the GO 910 and bought my wife the 330 XL, I can't maintain my two GPSs on one computer.#1 TomTom's customer support is simple to experience and explain: BLAME THE CUSTOMER.  There are no workarounds, after you've bought, they tell you that they don't support what you intended to buy.  This will catch up with TomTom.  By the way, I found a work around for the 2 GPS on one computer.  If you PLUG BOTH GPS UNITS IN AT THE SAME TIME then the software will ask which one you want to use when it starts.#2 330 XL has no expandability.  For example, I bought the $99 detailed USA map for my GO 910.  Every time I start the TomTom Home application it prompts me to install this map on the 330 XL.  ***News*** You can only install the map on 1 GPS, so I can't install the map on the 330 XL.  AND because the 330 XL does not have an internal memory card that can be upgraded (I opened mine and looked), you don't even have room to install the map!#3 The 330 XL has not cured me of listening to my buddy who said ""Buy Garmin, you'll be happier."" I think he was correct.Bill Meade"
2158,"My problem is my DIR-825 A1 doesn't provide a strong enough signal to reach my basement (there's a partial slab in the way, so I know it's a tough reach). After reading the spec's of the DAP-1522 on D-Link's website, I bought this thinking it would allow me to improve my basement coverage. Basically, I wanted it to act as a repeater for the wireless devices in the basement.Unfortunately, the device is NOT a wireless repeater. It has to be wired on one side and wireless on the other. If it's wired to your local LAN and transmitting on the wireless, D-Link calls this AP (Access Point) mode. If it receives a wireless signal and distributes wired Ethernet to remote devices, D-Link calls this Bridge mode.So figuring using two D-Link devices would give me a better wireless signal, I put the DAP-1522 in the basement in Bridge mode, then I tested the PS3. The internet connection was even worse. So I moved it upstairs and connected it next to my DIR-825 in AP mode. I tried configuring it to the same wireless network name as my DIR-825 in an attempt to boost the signal, but the two networks just competed with each other. Then I made it a different wireless network, but that was no better than the DIR-825's signal.So I called D-Link to see if there was a way I could use the DAP-1522 to boost the wireless signal of the DIR-825. At first they said yes, but after several more calls, it turned out that the answer was really no. Reminded me of that Monty Python Cheese Shop episode...So a little more research showed me that D-Link had a newer model of my DIR-825, the B1, and according to TomsHardware, this new model had much better wireless range. So I bought one of the new models, and lo and behold, my wireless signal is now working in the basement.Hopefully this review will save someone some money."
2159,"I've used various in-ear 'phones over the years, starting with Shure E2C's, then Etymotic ER-6i, and my current pair of choice are the Shure SE210 with triple flange sleeves for best isolation (the main reason I use these types of headphones.)Upon first opening the package of these Philips 'phones, they look a bit cheap. Despite the fair amount of included accessories, they don't match what Shure or Etymotic has to offer at this price range in terms of sound quality or isolation/comfort.To begin with the earpieces/drivers themselves for these canalbuds are small, perhaps a bit too small to provide the deep bass that other brands can. There is a fair variety of silicone ear cushion sizes as well as one foam ear cushion type. In my case, I always get the best seal/isolation with foam or triple flange cushions (the latter not compatible/included with this package.) Once in my ears though, everything is generally comfortable and the sound is definitely passable.The carrying case is also a pain to use, being so small and requiring the user to wind up the cords perfectly inside. I won't be using this. One positive note regarding size -- the cable fits the iPhone 2G recessed headphone jack.I'm actually using these in a medium noise office environment with the occasional ringing phone and constant conversation. I'm satisfied, though for future headphones, I'll definitely look for something a bit more heavy duty if I'm looking in this price range."
2160,"I had been causally on the lookout for a portable IPhone player, saw this and bought it a little impulsively due to the very low price it was being offered at the time.  It has a battery option along with a small footprint which were a couple of things I wanted in a portable player. Now that I've had it for over a month and used it a handful of times, I have to say, I wish I'd held off and looked at some other options.  To be clear, this isn't a bad unit.  Indoors with little background noise, it sounds pleasant enough.  I think though, its portability puts some stress on its ability to perform outside that ideal situation.  An important feature I was really looking for in a player was the ability to get good sound in an outdoor environment but, unfortunately that's probably this units weakest point. Some other consideration; the remote does not seem to control anything but ITunes.  That's nice but, I was hoping when listening to internet radio that I could at least control volume +/- with it.  The remote is also not very easy to use due to it's slick shiny hard to see surface.  It's also fairly slow to respond. Conclusion: In the right environment this is a fine little player but, don't expect to stretch it too far out of the house."
2161,"First of all the picture did confuse me. I looked to the pictures and believed that I was not going to have problem to carry my WD My Passport External Hard Drive, Midnight Bluetooth Mouse and the big Midnight Company B Mini Power Adapter. But when I received the package, I resigned myself to put all my stuff as I could. But with very limited space. I give this notebook sleeve 3, because space is nowadays a very feature to be appreciated."
2162,"I purchased this for my tablet and have no complaints.  The unit is large enough to fit my bare tablet and wallet inside the main pocket.  The outer side zipper is small but it is large enough to hold a small unit charger and a few small usb cables.  The unit feels sturdy and its haves adequate cushioning. The unit can take any minor bumps it might experience throughout the day.If any are questioning about the inner red lining causing ""staining"" on your bundled products, hand wash/soak and air dry the unit prior to first time use. Problem solved!Pro:Small, tiny, compact toteCons:Rumor of the inner red lining staining your bundled products over time.The unit can be too small for some people."
2163,"Like everyone else, I was a bit disappointed to receive the converter cable in a plain white box with no instructions.

2164,"I've used this product to pair an Apple Wireless keyboard, some Wii remotes with Dolphin, and a few other devices to test and all of them have the same issue; this thing just doesn't have very good range!  For certain things that require lots of input, like a Wii remote, you have to be 2ft or less from the adapter in order for it to even be useful at all.  Any further and the inputs just get missed.  Using the Apple Wireless keyboard (the newest version) lets me get about 5-6ft away from the computer before the computer outright cannot sense any input at all.  It works, so I'm going to give it 3 stars, but it just doesn't work very well beyond the range stated.  It's also advertised to reach up to 30ft, and that's just downright now true.  I'm either chalking it up to crappy design or crappy components, either way I'd just avoid this altogether if you are going to be further away from the receiver than 5-6 feet."
2165,"I like its low profile looks, the easiness of installation, compatibility with Linux OpenSuSE 11.4,Windows 7, and Windows XPMCE, works with most devices that supports bluetooth (Mice, Keyboards, Phones, Headsets, and Rocket launchers)...but, what I ultimately use this for is the ability to use a keyboard and a mouse while I'm relaxing in bed watching a downloaded movie or online TV such as Hulu(tm).  The range of bluetooth signal obviously becomes poor at 5-6 feet away. Get farther than that and it's no longer working."
2166,"Item arrived damaged on one side. It has a large scratch on one side, seems from box cutter. Inside the enclosure has very jagged edges, Be careful not to cut yourself when putting the disk in. Very tight space.The shipping was fast. Other than above it works perfect. Not worth the time to contact seller for replacement."
2167,"While researching to buy a 50mm 1.4 i was confused between canon and sigma.  I read mixed reviews about sigma and a lot of ppl complaining about front focus or back focus problem, I took a shot at it anyway so I won't have regrets.  Here is my take about this lensCons:1) the focus really is a hit and miss.  I never felt confident that I would get my photo sharp at selected focal point.2) by no means it is a light or a small lens.Pros:1) build quality is nice2) for the shots that i was able to get with accurate focus actually turned out very nice.3) Bokeh was awesome.  Loved the round light circles and creamy feel of bokeh4) comes with a lens hood and a decent case.Outcome:So after a use of about 3 weeks I finally gave up and returned it.  I just got a canon 50mm 1.4 a few days ago and right after the first use I could tell that focus was a lot more accurate with canon even at f1.4.  I yet have to compare the bokeh of the two lenses because I heard people say that sigma has a better bokeh.  I guess I will know that soon but in any case focus was much more important to me than the bokeh.Before you do make a final decision for your purchase, do know that sigma has a good warranty where they would fix and fine tune the focus problem for your camera's model but I just didn't have time or energy to give it a try.  If it doesn't work for me out of the box sorry its going back.Update: In case it might help anyone i wanted to mention that the above review is based on a my usage on a canon 60d body."
2168,"This switch works great as a manual switch, but it is misleading to say it works with keyboard shortcuts, ""IT"" (the switch) DOES NOT.What it will do is have software that will control it and the software will detect keyboard shortcuts.  So this works fine in the many ""driving/controlling"" PCs connected to one USB device, but not a driving/controlling USB device connected to many PCs.So you'd be mistaken, if like me, were hoping to use it as an automated KVM (well, minus the V I guess) switch.  You can have a USB hub attached to it and your mouse and keyboard attached to the hub, and connect it to multiple PCs and hope that you can go from machine to machine/screen to screen, but NOT by pressing some key combo.  You have to press the buttons on the switch."
2169,I have a LogiTech Squeezebox downstairs which brings up my favorite  stations with one click.  Nothing on this model can be accomplished  without  multiple clicks even when it can find the WiFi signal.  Feature rich but nested menu system is wrong headed for sleepy users.  Not recommended .Also needs Pandora  access added to be competitive .
2170,"It is as simple as it looks, good quality material, did not give 5 stars because I believe it should include the wall mounting bracket/plate."
2171,"This combination DVD recorder/player/VCR recorder/player truly deserves a mixed review. On the bright side, it is not hard to use if you want to record a TV program or record a movie off the television at a later time onto a blank DVD-R disc; and it finalizes and plays back a DVD-R with a good quality picture. In addition, once it was hooked up and I could use the remote to program things, my relatively simple needs were met for recording movies off the television onto a blank DVD-R.However, the sound on DVD-R playback is a bit low; and the manual that comes with this machine is not exactly user-friendly. Even the remote took me some time to learn; and that's not good, either. One more thing: once I learned how to use the remote, it was easy enough to set the timer on the machine to start and stop recording, but once I leave that screen I can only see the date and time it will start recording as well as the number of minutes the machine is programmed to record for. LG doesn't have a DVD main programming screen that specifically indicates the time the machine will stop recording! If I want to see the turn off time again, I must go back into the actual programming screen.The manual lists a lot of features; I have yet to test them all so it's difficult to comment on all of them. The manual didn't help me much to work with the on-screen menu; but after a brief learning curve I was able to master the on-screen menu without problems. Finalizing a DVD disc takes about the right time which is a plus.The machine can connect to a TV using a HDMI cable but I didn't hook it up this way because my TV doesn't have a place for the HDMI cable to connect with this machine.There are other fancy features including playing a DVD while you are still recording onto it; making ""playlists"" and adding/deleting titles or chapters. I mention this to give you more examples of what the machine is capable of doing even though I personally don't need these features. I certainly hope that if you do get this machine that it works better for you than it did for the people who were so dissatisfied with it!This is really an average DVD Recorder/Video Cassette Recorder with playback capability and many more features; hopefully LG is making these machines somewhat more reliably by now. Although I don't need the fancier features I do notice that even as a basic machine the sound on playback is too low; the manual is not well-written and the on-screen menus require a bit of a learning curve. All of the DVD program screens should indicate the time the machine will stop recording in addition to the time it starts recording, too, and not just tell you the time it will start recording and total number of minutes it will record off the television. Overall, this may be a good machine for people with very basic needs like myself; but if you must have a DVD/VCR machine that allows you to really work with your DVDs and more, I would recommend that you keep on looking."
2172,"This was advertised as a universal mount, and I had checked everything to check, and it didn't fit my 27 "" Samsung.  Since an installer was here, had to go and purchase a replacement."
2173,"It has a great set of features for the price you pay. Gigabit router with good bandwidth and range. The USB feature is great when it works!Has some annoying glitches that makes me give only three stras. The USB drive feature was not working, but the software update fixed it. After I started using this router, I noticed that my computers will loose internet connectivity once in a while even though it is connected to the router. Sometimes I have to disconnect and reconnect again to get the internet connectivity back. This never used to happen before I started using this router and now it happens to all my computers every few days. Makes it annoying especially when you are not home and others in the family can't get online untill you go fix it."
2174,Don't know how come I was asked to rate this as I have not purchased it lately............I must be getting old
2175,"Recently I bought 3 earphones at various price level to compare them, here's mytake (in order of my personal prefernece):1) Sony EX300: With 13.5mm driver & cost only forty five bucks this buds provide the fullestmusic across all spectrum of frequencies. Tight bass & decent mid/high level without anycolorization provides very good balance & true reproduction of music (especially if you encodeyour music in lossless format). The cable is not traditional Y type so you should leave cablebehind neck, decent volume output & sound detail which is very close to the performance of overthe ear studio monitor style headphone. It's not good for use in gym since the cable will betangling down on your left side which may interfere with your left hand movement during workout.Wire is soft rubber style which is very soft to touch & it won't produce any noise while walking.It's a solid earphone in terms of built quality.2) Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10: For ninety five buck this is my second pair of UE headphones (alsoowned a SuperFi 5vi), the high sensitivity level gives it the loudest/clearest volume outputamong all three tested, TripleFi 10 provides better sound isolation than Sony EX300, but withmore than twice the price tag of Sony, Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 seems lacking both thelower/higher end  frequency range in comparison with Sony EX300 during my A/B switch test. Howeverdon't get me wrong as TripleFi 10 still performs very well all by itself, it just took me bysurprise that Sony EX300 covers much wider frequency range if you listen very carefully tomusic details, but for most people who encode their music at lower ratio it may not be an issuesince the high level of sound output of TripleFi 10 may compensates for the lack of extremehigh/low frequency range without an A/B comparison test. Music coming out from TripleFi 10 hasmore 'dimension' to it due to its multi-driver design. I'm using it mostly for my daily commute &gym, the wire construction is cheap as others had complained & I've already experienced rightside sound coming on/off occasionally.3) MEElectronices M9P: with fifteen bucks MEElectonics M9P offers the best sound/price ratiowhich even comes with an Apple device compatible mic and track control(double click to skip tonext track), the sound performance is not up there with the Sony/Ultimate Ears but it's decentenough for the daily gym workout, the sound output level is the lowest among all three modelstested. I have to turn up the volume to nearly 75% to hear the music clearly. The built qualityis on par with those other headphones cost around 20~40. It's very hard to find a better soundingheadphone at this price range which also offers iphone compatible mic as well. If budget is yourmain concern this headphone will not disappoint you. Some die hard UE fans may be p---d that I compare TripleFi 10 with MEElectronics headphones, my point is that although UE TripleFi 10 for sure outperforms these lower price headphones in many ways but whether that margin is worth the price difference is really a judgement call.Conclusion: I'm not a fan of Sony in recent years but I have to admit Sony's reasonably pricedheadphones are worth listening to & it sure can withstand the comparison to headphones that costtwice or more. Everyone has different taste in music & audio/sensitivity preference so the bestway to tell if a headphone fits you is to compare as many pairs as possible. Hopefully it helpsfor your headphone shopping."
2176,"It  works on my T3i but only after tap it on my hand. Only the upper buttons works, the others do not do anything"
2177,"ok so the good um its got cap and its not expansive, and the bad well its huge compered to other bluetooth adapters. and thats about it."
2178,"I bought the PoGo specifically to be able to make on-the-spot postcards from our Africa trip. I had made a place to mount the 2 x 3 print on card stock and pre-addressed envelopes. The sticky back on the PoGo print was great for mounting on the card which had a ""Greetings from Africa"" message and our signature.Well, on the second day of our adventure in South Africa, my entire camera outfit was stolen including the PoGo, all the media and a special 9 volt charger I had made to power it in the bush.I reordered the printer from Company A (for $20 less than I paid at Target before) and made the prints in the good old USA, sent them out, and now have the printer in my new camera bag ready for a new adventure (hopefully without a theft). All was insured, so I was not out any money, but felt violated by the South African thief.Warning: Be very careful in South Africa, they steal everything!By the way, the PoGo printer is a fantastic tool for the purpose I just used it for, but is not what one would call a high quality device. My insurance agent liked mine so much, he bought 5 for his children and his business. Now he can shoot the ""before"" pictures for his business on his cell phone and print them immediately. I saw a pile of old traditional Polaroid Cameras in the junk in his office.I decided that a second battery ($29.95 from Polaroid) was easier to obtain by buying a second printer from Company A for $39 which included a pack of paper. However, when this one arrived it had a European power pack with the AC power cord missing. I called Polaroid and they were aware of this and said I could buy a USA power pack for $29.95 directly from Polaroid. Actually all that was missing was the power cord and I have a few of these from other devices. My point is that Company A is selling European units on the cheap minus an essential part. Beware."
2179,This works great but if you looking to get N Speeds be aware that it only works if you have the 3rd Connection wire
2180,"It does have a 640x480 picture resolution but I would rate the image quality somewhere between poor and average. The stand is a bit wobbly. The quality of the picture is nowhere close to a 5MP digital camera photo. Did not test the mic yet.Good value for money as a very basic video chat device, but not something to record memories."
2181,"This dock worked great for about a year.  Then it started having connection issues with my mac (the same mac I had used the year it worked fine).  Frustrating to try and use it and not be able too.  I contacted Thernaltake about the warranty and they were great to deal with.  They sent me a brand new one and I shipped them the old one back in the new one's box (they paid for shipping).  The new one worked great, but it too started having the same connection problem.  Though I appreciate dealing with Thermaltake and their honoring the warranty, I decided not to send the second one back in, but rather try a different brand.  The verdict is still out on the other brand, but for the last couple of months, it has been working great..."
2182,"This does the quick fix trick, but it is pretty cheap and flimsy.  I would recommend spending an extra buck or two for something of better quality - especially if you are planning to use your drive long term."
2183,"Great for the price, though I wouldn't use this all the time. Whenever I am helping others with their backup/restore/reimage I use this to slave to friends laptop; after a while the connector got flimsy and started getting randomly disconnected to pc."
2184,"This little antenna is great because it's small and discrete however, some of the weaker channels do not get picked up and i wonder if it's due to the antenna's size. Fortunately, the channels I am referring to are not my favorite channels so it doesn't really make a difference."
2185,"Hi, this is my second GPS.  I bought my first, a Magellan in 2006.I bought this based on Consumer Reports.The worst features on this unit, dealbreakers in my mind are the Bluetooth and POI search.The Bluetooth is a total waste of time if you want anyone to hear you.You can hear them fine, so if you just want voicemail...hey its great.If you want to talk...forget it.The points of interest search is woeful.I once entered ""Malibu State Park"" or very similar.It was still searching 20 minutes later.Other searches take at least a few minutes.My Magellan searched in seconds.All the other things it does are pretty good.Same as all the rest.I would give this a miss.I will go back to Magellan next time."
2186,"OK, so when I opened the box, this huge bag was just sitting there with some orange ""ears"" (???). I lifted it out, and immediately thought , ""Wow! This is BIG and heavy!"" Since it's a camera bag, reading the instructions (a pictorial tag attached to the strap) seemed silly, so I started taking it apart. It's really well constructed (ergo, the weight). Very thick sides, top, etc. The waterproof inner bag (orange) seems quite substantial, too. Inside that are the separators that allow for several lenses, cameras, cell phone, iPod, whatever. I removed all, and put the separators back in the main bag... it's still seems heavy even without the waterproof bag. I put it all back together, inserted my old Canon FTB, three lenses, my Nikon 950, and my Canon S3... I decided not to hose it down to check out its waterproofing capabilities, but I can tell you I truthfully believe it will not allow water inside the orange bag.Pros: BIG, sturdy (the straps, bag, and strap connectors are all very substantial), waterproof, easy to use (access, item insert/removal, etc.)Cons: BIG, heavyLast thought: I wouldn't consider opening the inner orange bag while exposed to the reason to have the bag: water! But once out of the rain/fog/waterfall, I am confident the stuff inside will come out dry."
2187,"This works just fine but there is really no major difference, if any, between using this or using the standard cables."
2188,This is a GORGEOUS radio and I would have kept it and given it a 5 star rating except for what I wanted to use it for it failed. The sound with music stations is rich and full -  just as folks describe. My primary use for the WR-11 was for NPR and other FM talk in our bath/dressing area. Where we wanted to place the unit talk radio had way too much bass and was too boomy - so if there was anything going on (Shower etc) you just heard rumbles. I knew this unit didn't have bass/treble adjustments but I LOVED the analog style so I took a risk. But I am sending it back. I have since purchased the less sexy digital sister the wr-2 and it works perfectly (It has bass adjustments). So if this had worked for our use I would have given 5 stars. But since I had to send it back because it wasn't great for the talk radio in the space I listen I give it 3.
2189,"It's not specified but it does work with my 32GB Zune HD. There are not too many docking options for us Zune owners, but this one sounds well and seems to work well enough.03/11 Update: Remote control SUCKS! Not sure if the remote is just a P.O.S. or if it's not supposed to work with the Zune HD but sometimes the remote just stops responding. I have replaced the battery with no change. Otherwise, unit has been working well."
2190,"Sound isolation works, but it decreases sound quality. The bass was muffed and lost the clarity.The last solution is to trim down the tip."
2191,"I bought this to replace a Lowepro SlingShot 100Lowepro SlingShot 100 All-Weather Digital Camera Backpack - Black. If you read the specifications in the relevant websites they appear to be about the same size. This bag is larger, more about that below.The main appeal of this bag was the ability to use the Kata Tripod HolderKata KT ZZ-STH-3N1 3N1 Tripod Holder (Black). I found the tripod holder doesn't work as well as I hoped. You can read my review there.I went to the Kata website and saw a very good video showing how versatile the 3N1 system is. That was very appealing, and could be a plus with a larger and heavier bag. What they don't tell you is this backpack is trying to be several things at the same time and doesn't do any of them better than a purpose designed bag. If I had seen it in a bricks and mortar store I wouldn't have bought it. After trying this bag out, I think I'd rather have a dedicated slingbag for light weight hiking and a dedicated backpack for heavier loads.This bag is very well made, probably better made than the Lowepro. Plus it comes with a  5 year warranty which can be extended to lifetime if you register it on their site within a certain time period.The Lowepro SlingShot was designed to be a sling type bag and doesn't stick out as much. I never worried about hitting something with the Lowepro. The Kata 3N1-10 sticks out quite a bit behind you, partially because of the extra straps. I also think the Lowepro is more comfortable. It appears the Kata 3N1 bags were based on a regular backpack that was modified to be a slingback without giving up backpack features. If I were to get another Kata bag, it would be one of their backpacks and not a 3N1. I just don't like the extra space taken up by the 3N1 system.This bag will hold more than the Lowepro Slingshot 100. That bag is almost too small for my purposes and  it doesn't have a way of carrying a tripod. But it also keeps me from carrying things I don't need. I'm returning the Kata 3N1-10 and keeping the Lowepro SlingShot 100. I've decided to have a local shop sew a couple of straps on it to hold my tripod."
2192,"Pros: Good external RAID box, decent performance, very solid construction, good build quality, good priceCons: Loud fan NEVER SPINS DOWN, bright LEDs, annoying error message when using a Mac with RAID 1Works fine with Macs but will give you a ""this disk is not compatible with your operating system and must be initialized"" error.  Ignore it.  Loud fans make it almost unusable for HTPC video storage.  I will probably take it up to work and use it for offsite backup and replace it with a Synology NAS."
2193,"I bought the Motorola wireless headphones and then this bluetooth adapter. The adapter auto syncs with the headphones, but it takes time.I'm not sure why but it takes up to 5 minutes or even 10 for it to pair with my headphones. It is a bit frustrating, but the price tag on it tells you that you ain't getting the best there is out there.After pairing it works like a charm. Clear audio quality, no skiping, no hissing, no nothing while making excersice. I even put it inside my backpack and works perfectly along with my bluetooth phone. When it rings the headphones pause the iPod, answer the call, hangup,push the play button and start listenting to my music again, no issues.The only problem is that it is a bit too big and can unplug itself quite easily. If you want something miles better and bought an expensive set of headphones, don't get this adapter, try the Sony adapter for instance.And it drains your battery 50% faster. So charge your iPod up to 100% if you want it to last for a reasonable amount of time."
2194,This connector works fine but does have very thin metal on the conection ring.  It crushes easily during application so you have to be very careful.
2195,"If you have not yet owned an ultrazoom (10X or higher), you will probably like the FZ28. It's a nice camera, smaller and lighter than my Sony, but loaded with features and options.In the past 6 years, I have owned 3 or 4 digital cameras. One or two years ago, I bought a Sony DHC-H5, primarily for its 12X zoom, which was a stunning improvement over the 10X I previously owned. I was one click away from buying the Sony DHC-H50 when I started reading rave reviews about the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. A bit of research convinced me to buy it from Company A. In less than 24 hours, I returned it. (I admit I should have given it more time, but my basic disappointment would not have changed.)There is a gotcha in comparing zooms. A 12X is not necessarily 20% better than a 10X. The X factor is based on the unzoomed wide angle lens. The FZ28 has a much wider lens than the H5. On the plus side, the FZ28 will capture more of the scene before you because of that wide lens. However, that wide angle lens means 18X isn't as much of a zoom as one might think.To truly compare lenses, you must look at the 35mm equivalents for each lens. The 18X FZ28 zoom maxes to 486mm; the 15X H50 is 465mm. Both should reach farther than the 12X H5 at 432mm. But in careful testing, taking pictures from the same spot with the FZ28 and the H5, the zoom shots were virtually identical. (Actually, the H5's auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but the zooms were undistinguishable.) Because of the vagaries of the X factor, I didn't expect a huge improvement, but I still expected to be wowed and I was not. And by not being wowed, I was disappointed, even though this zoom will wow anyone who hasn't used another long zoom.I considered hanging on to the FZ28. It has many newer features lacking on my older H5, such as face detection and smile detection. Unfortunately, the LCD is smaller and less sharp than the H5.The tipping point was a rather minor feature, ironically. Most cameras record JPEGs, which is fine for most uses. A lot of high-end cameras shoot RAW format, which stores much more information than a JPEG. That info can be very useful in a powerful photo editor. Frankly, I crop and make minor tweaks that work fine in JPEG format. But, the fact that the FZ28 offers RAW + JPEG (one shot, two pix) tipped me towards the FZ28. And back again.You cannot shoot RAW if you use the fully automatic mode (Intelligent Assist). I can't understand why that is so, but it is true. So, if you want RAW, you forego auto and vice versa. Crazy. Unacceptable to me, as minor as my interest in RAW is.I'm not trying to steer anyone away from the FZ28 except for someone like me who is trying to pick between it and another camera and is swayed by the 18X zoom and RAW format. Make sure you have other reasons for buying the FZ28.peace,mjh"
2196,"This product comes with no directions, but is very simple to hook up -- you don't even need the charger; just plug the cylinder into the bottom of your iPhone or other device and tune it to the same frequency as a staticy FM station, then play audio on your phone and hear it on your radio.  If you plug in the included cord, you *might* get a little bit better quality transmission (the cord acts as an antenna) but not much -- but at least it does charge your device while it's playing.The challenge is to get decent quality.  It is VERY difficult to get this thing to play without a lot of static.  The way you hold it, or if you hold it, or turn it, close to your body or farther away, etc. all influence the amount of static that comes along with the audio.I was able to minimize static (but it didn't disappear) by holding it and moving it around until the signal was the clearest.  Any time is set it down, there was no way to have minimal static -- I had to hold it.  This is not practical if you are driving so I suggest this is best used on a road trip, listening to an audiobook, with a passenger who can monkey with it while you drive (or vice versa.)  It's not really practical to use on your own unless you're willing to tolerate a fair amount of static.By trial and error, was able to get a static-free transmission by wrapping a square of tinfoil, about 6"" x 6"", around the cylinder (not around the whole phone.)  Not very handy, but it was the *only* way I could ever get the thing to transmit with zero static.  And I still had to hold it in just the right way.I can't believe how inexpensive it was, how simple it is to use...but I only recommend it if you are prepared to monkey with it constantly.  Not a good long-term solution, but a cheap and workable solution for a road trip with a friend."
2197,"This device is useful for a lot of situations - the iPhone with a dying battery, the iPod or iPod Mini which can't hold a charge, and those moments where I need to download or transfer data. I've had to use this device in each of the aforementioned situations, and it's come through each time. As far as functionality, this is a great device.However, there are a few oversights in the design itself.(1) The end caps - I hate using USB devices with an end cap because they can come off and get lost or broken, and this device has two caps. If the iPhone/iPod port had a retractable design likethis oneand the usb port had a swivel cap design likethis device, that would have been a huge improvement.(2) No loop - This drive has no loop for a keychain so it's a little awkward to carry around.(3) The USB cord - I can't synch up my iPod or iPhone without using this cord, so that's yet another thing I have to carry around. It'd be nice to see a retractable cable similar tothisbuilt into the unit.(4) No write-protection. I was surprised to see this missing, since it's a standard feature on other USB devices.The following mission statement comes directly from Macally's website:""Our mission is to provide those users with the highest quality and value product which exceeds their expectations and provides an effortless and pleasant interface with their PCs.We are achieving our mission through excellence in design, manufacturing and service.""After using this device, I'd have to say that it didn't exceed my expectations - and the ""excellence in design"" will need to be reworked for the next version."
2198,I like the notebook but because it is so slow in performance i need to return it.Vista already slows the notebook and on top of it all sony 3rd party junk make it very very slow.More over the system crashed right out of box.You need to force start very first time.Otherwise very good in weight style and lcd .
2199,"OK I admit I don't like misrepresentation but all things considered these are sleazy little boxes @ $10 you expect Tannoy EV or RCF?I bought them for near field monitors for the laptop, they do a decent job at defining percussion fairly well the hi end is raggedand there is at least some accuracy in the low end at low to normal levels, just perfect for watching movies in hotels motels etc, now for Joe Isuzu (who I really like).Truth in advertising ????  ""3 Way""??? there is a cone driver, a 1.75"" piezo and a psychological ""super tweeter"" (Shiny foil disk, no wires), not to mention the ""capacitor crossover network"" now technically a piezo element is a capacitor or at least it behaves like one, the impedance decreases as the frequency raises, I did stuff a 12 ohm 1/2  watt in series with the piezo but... it ain't a crossover!I cannot imagine what bogus power rating system they use, I think it's the same one that rates a $110 component that draws a maximum of 160 watts from the wall and delivers 800 watts a channel, sorry pal, watts don't just magically pop into existence without EMF, if they did the energy crises would be historic.If your looking for the truth remember WRMS (watts root mean square) or in audio land ""Really means something"", I'll bet if I took my Ampeg SVT, drove it to 20 VRMS @ 1.5 khz and stuffed that into one of these boxes, I'd let the smoke out of it in pretty short order."

2203,"I mounted this horizontally in my RV to hold the stand for a Rand McNally RNVD 7720. That is a large gps unit designed for RVs and the base suction cup is large. This fit the base almost exactly but, after about 2 months of occasional use, the plate separated from the glued bottom making the plate useless.I live in a very hot climate but this separation occurred in May when it was not very hot. The RV was in storage and the interior temperature was probably about 90 when I opened the door to cool off the RV. I mounted the gps after the interior had cooled but the glue holding the plate to the dash was probably still warm and the entire thing separated.On the positive side I was able to remove the glued part of this unit without scaring the &#34;wood&#34; that it was mounted on."
2204,"My sister purchased this or similar, but w/o remote. It was impressive with the amount of channels it received with a decent antenna. I purchased this to use with a laptop. All seemed fine; even with the little (supplied) whip antenna, it managed to received about (16) channels. I tried the remote; it seemed to work. However, the next day, all the remote was capable of doing is changing channels, via the up/down channel toggle switch, nothing else worked. No documentation is provided or on the manufacturer's web site for the remote.Anyone else able to get the remote working fully?"
2205,"Update: Updating my review. This died on me with little warning after a couple years. I wrote a full system backup to it everyday, so it got decent usage. I still think it should have lasted longer. I suppose you get what you pay for.---I bought this on sale for under $100, and I haven't had a single regret about the purchase. I've had no connection issues with Mac or Windows XP, granted I've only been using this for a couple weeks now. My only complaint is that FireWire 800 and eSATA cords are not included.Let me explain how I'm utilizing this bad-boy. I currently have 3 partitions. I have a 450GB partition for basic Mac storage (this is where I keep a full image backup and other files that I don't need access to all the time), a 400GB partition for a Time Machine backup, and a 100 GB partition for XP. I left the extra space for a potential linux partition or what have you for a later point in time.I'm using a generic Dynex eSATA II ExpressCard adapter ($20) and Belkin eSata cable with my MacBook Pro, and this hard drive flies. I moved 25GB in less than 10 min. I've had no problems with nightly run backups, and the Time Machine implementation works without any problems.I debated going with a bus powered drive, but I decided I liked the reliability of an external power source. I haven't had near the problems I've had with portable bus powered drives."

2209,"My old little portable TV used for emergencies ""expired"" in February 2009 - so I ordered one of these because they are set up for the new digital broadcasts.  The first one I received didn't pick up any channels and had no sound.  I figured it had to be a damaged unit, so returned it to Company A for a replacement and the second one is working fine.  Picks up most of my local channels -Some with amazing clarity and others fuzzy, but I live out in the country, so I'm okay with that since it's really just for emergencies.  I'm amazed at the technology, seeing such a sharp, full color picture on that little screen.  I've read from other reviews that the battery lasts about 2 hours, but hopefully that'll get us thru a storm.  Comes with AC cord, detachable antenna, triple video input cable, car plug-in, remote control (including batteries) and rechargable internal battery.  Note, internal battery MUST be installed before it will come on.  It's got one of those tiny plug-ins like cordless phones, so make sure it's connected.  Overall, I would recommend it."

If Mac OSX isn't asking for the password you can't use your fingerprint to sign in.  This might change in the future.  The software for Mac is still in the beta stage if you are running 10.6 or higher.I was hoping this would be a dynamic product like Digital Persona is (DP is the best you can find). Instead it's more of a gimic.  This product has potential but it's just not up to par yet."
2213,"I've had this for a few years now but lately has been replaced by my android smartphone for trips in the USA. On the plus side, the traffic feature works pretty well in metro areas and it's easy enough to carry around. Despite taking a long time to initially satellites occasionally, it does navigate accurately in Europe. There a few points where it beats a smartphone: the voice is more clear and understandable and the location accuracy is more precise.But... The battery life is atrocious; I could charge it all day and it won't last more than about 5 minutes unplugged. The A-B-C keyboard layout is annoying... a QWERTY layout would have been faster. I'm pretty sure map updates cost more than the device itself, and I just cannot justify paying for them when a smartphone gets free map updates, live traffic, etc."
2214,"For many years now, I've been on the road a lot. I've owned many brands of GPS units, both windshield-mount and in smart phones. Years back, I owned my first Garmin. In my opinion, it was better than the others in navigation, including today's smart phones which I still use. This unit is no exception. It offers excellent routing and turn-by-turn navigation.The touch-screen features are great. You can quickly find food, fuel, police stations, etc. while navigating with just two quick screen presses. Viewing aerial maps is easy as well to help humans gain bearings like you would with a traditional paper map. This feature allows you to use your finger to scroll about the map so you can see what's around you.Traffic Notification seems to work fairly well, but isn't always accurate, nor should one expect it to be.I was REALLY disappointed in the display's brightness and clarity during the day even on external power. Even if its not directly in the sun, the screen washes out almost completely. If the driver is wearing a light-colored shirt, the reflection of the shirt will wash out the display. It makes no sense because it is has a matt finish, but it happens and is extremely annoying. Wearing sunglasses worsens the situation.In conclusion, I'm very happy with this GPS unit's ability to navigate and its featureset, but I can only see the display when the sun is not a factor."
2215,Like others have said you get what you pay for. The lense is solid feeling and looks like it will last a while. It also a lot cheaper than other wide angle lenses you can buy. While it does a decent job of giving you more of the scene there is noticeable barreling and blurring at the edges especially in lower light and lense flare is a definite issue.
2216,"The ""Live View"" feature is not usable to take still photos.  It takes several seconds to do autofocus and the shutter delay and mirror vibration are significant.When the camera is in Live View mode, the mirror is flipped up, the shutter is open.  Autofocus is done through software image processing through the image sensor.  It takes at least two three seconds to focus on a subject with good contrast.  And often the autofocus goes into ""hunting"" for several more seconds before it settles down.When shutter release is pressed in Live View, the camera closes the shutter, drop the mirror then lift the mirror and open the shutter.  All these actions create a long shutter delay and significant vibration.Because the mirror is held in the up position and the shutter is open in Live View, it consumes a great amount of battery charge and produces a great amount of heat for the circuit.It appears that Live View is released before the design is ready.Another problem is that Nikon changed the raw file format.  Weeks after the camera is on the market, the raw image file format is still not supported by PhotoShop or Nikon's own Capture NX2."
2217,Used as a couple between two HDMI cables from my XOOM to HDTV. Worked Great.Sometimes it doesn't work and I question the quality of the product.Tried with the XBOX 360 Slim and Non-slim models as well. 60/100 chance it works when you need it.
2218,"It's an easy to handle camera, the quality of pictures doesn't wow me but it's ok considering its price. Olympus cameras seem to have a better quality."
2219,"I bought this inexpensive portable speaker for my Kindle so that my wife and I could listen to audiobooks when we drive for several hours to visit family and friends. Our car is an SUV with a small amount of road noise at speeds greater than 50mph. Although the iLuv works well in the quiet of our home, it lacks sufficient volume (even at maximum volume on both the Kindle and the iLuv) to overcome the road noise of our car. This may be a Kindle specific problem since the volume is fine with my iPod and Xoom."
2220,"The good:Nice to look at,  nice and comfortable too.NOISE CANCELING works well but only on steady sounds.  Conversation comes right on through unmuffled.The Bad:30-20,000 frequency range is extremely low to not even there on the lower notes.My Skull Candy earbuds out performed these headphones by a long shot.I listen to all types of music and everything sounded like it was on a high pass filter."
2221,I bought this and used if for a couple of weeks. The unit has good range but is fairly heavy compared to the valentine and much longer. The gps feature to mark false alarm areas is a great feature. However I ended up returning this.The worst feature of this detector was the top mounted controls which are lit up. Not a problem during the day but the light from the top controls display reflected like a mirror in the windshield at night and there was no way that i could figure out to turn off the top of the detectors passive lighting which is on at all times. It was distracting seeing these lights up in the windshield glass once it got dark out. Having all the lighted controls on the front and not top of the detector would be much better. Maybe I just own the one car that has a windshield that results in this reflective effect.I bought the valentine one after sending this one back and that one has the display on the front only but when it goes off at night it lights up like a christmas tree for all to see so it may just be me expecting the displays to be a little more thought out when paying for a premium detector.Update: I bought the escort redline. The display is great and the range is the best out there.
2222,"I like this case and would give it 5 stars but it has no pocket.  my last case had an outside pocket and Kept my extra batteries in it. It is, however, a very sturdy case."
2223,"Like a lot of other people the sound worked out of the box (on a Windows 7 64-bit machine) but the remote control was dead no matter what I tried (installing newer software, playing with the configuration, different machines, different usb ports, reversing the battery, etc).  Suspecting the provided battery was dead I checked it with a battery meter and it was reading 3V (which is what a C2025 cell battery is supposed to read).  After trying a bunch of other things I decided to swap the battery with another device that uses the same type of battery and voila!  It started working!  The other device even worked with the battery from this remote.So when all else fails try a new battery."
2224,I found the thickness of the cable to a big disappointment. I would expect better from Nikon. I have purchased similar items from off brand manufactures for a third of the price whose quality seem to be better. Sure it worked out of the box. Did what it's suppose to. Time will tell the true quality of the item.
2225,it works great but there is only one draw back. because of the way that the jack is shaped it does not fit into an iPod with a case on.
2226,"I bought this product a year ago, and have had some issues with it.  After a couple of months I got this fine line that went across the screen.  I contacted apple and they sent me a refurbished one.  Which was good, except that the refurbished one they sent me, broke after a month and they refused to replace it.  Not nice.  All of this aside, the iPod, when functioning is awesome!  Great everything, and easy to use."
2227,"This review is for the TL-WR841N. This thing seems to have a problem with the 40 MHz radio. Despite my LG G2 being a/b/g/n compatible, it would cycle between &#34;authenticating/obtaining IP&#34; every few seconds. Once I hard set the router to 20 MHz then it was stable. The other model, TL-WDR3600, has the same problem.I haven't decided if I'm returning the TL-WR841N. I'm trying to use several devices. The devices I had trouble connecting were an external Wi-Fi card, an LG G2, iPad 2, and Apple TV (all N-band compatible). It didn't matter the channel, the SSID, the passphrase, or the encryption. Once the choice of Automatic, 20MHz, 40Mhz, was changed to 20MHz then all devices connected and were stable.I've read several forum posts about the TP-LINK having this problem despite firmware upgrades. I don't recall any of the firmware upgrades addressing this issue in the documentation, so take that for what you want regarding TP-LINK support."
2228,satisfactory performance except no improvement was noted when compared to the 8 year unit replaced. there is no way to test performance.
2229,"OK, I saw couple bad reviews on this TV, well I got this TV for $185 at Target, after taxed it's about $200.  it's a good deal, but let's see how long it's last:)  So far I like it, with no problem yet."
2230,"...it didn't work for me.The rating should really be for the ATSC digital TV system. It makes great pictures but is very finicky to receive over the air in some circumstances--like in an urban area. I'm using a very small stick antenna that came with myAxion AXN-8701hand held TV set. All was well until June 12 when three digital TV stations moved from UHF physical channels to channels 7, 11 and 13 respectively. Reception vanished for these channels while all of the others--still on physical UHF channels--continued as before. So, I got one of these antennas this morning at Best Buy (for $49.00). This afternoon I took it back. The little stick is much better. Many of the physical UHF channels could no longer be reliably received with the ANT1450. I think this is a matter of specific reception location. The RCA antenna might be great next door. It is just not any good where I am. The best advice would be to give it a try and return it if it is not the one."
2231,"These are just ok. Had I known better before I ordered them, I would have gone with a better quality and a ton more power.  This is definitely a starter set, or for someone who has a tiny studio space. The light's need to be pretty close to the subject to even be effective. the build quality is ok, I wouldn't drop them if I were you. Both the modeling lights died almost within a few uses. And I can't seem to find anywhere on the site where I can buy replacement bulbs?I recently ordered new, way more powerful strobes. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR! Save your money, buy better lights. That's what I would have done, in hindsight. Anyways, great for a small studio, student photographer, an"
2232,"I bought these not expecting to much seeing as how they were only 20 dollars. Well I will say I am pretty pleased with these. They are not as loud as I expected but they aren't bad. On the product info I read it stated that the bass on these were really good but, The bass is pretty much nonexistent, All I hear with these headphones is treble. They also feel lightweight which is a plus but being so lightweight they also feel kind of cheap. Not amazing headphones but for the price they aren't bad at all. Good buy if your looking for cheap headphones."
2233,"I purchased a 16GB previous generation nano in February 2010 with the intention of replacing the stock apple headphones with these J2s.I have poor hearing so this review is on build quality, comfort, etc.Without adjusting the volume level from halfway on the nano the stock headphones are louder than the J2.The J2 also seemed to have less high and midrange (compared to stock).The J2 appears to be excellent build quality and very comfortable and the cord length is about six inches longer which will help me using the J2s with my pc.I will keep the stock headphones on the nano.My rating is money well spent for a backup set headphones."
2234,"Well, first the good news:  as advertised, it has not shorted out from sweat during a workout yet (I've destroyed a couple of sets of Apple iPod earbuds this way, so this is a big deal to me).  The nominal sound quality is pretty good, and the comfort is pretty good as well; the sound and comfort are good either with or without the foam covers for the earphones.The one big flaw with these earphones is that they make an extremely good seal in my ear.  This means that sweat collects in my ears as I work out.  This is a comfort issue, but it's also a sound quality issue:  as the workout progresses and I sweat, the sound quality gets poorer and the frequency response shifts (in some cases I also get a bit of an echo or reverb effect).  It's tolerable for me, but I only run for about 35 minutes at a time; after that I can dry off the headphones and dry out my ears, and then I can do the rest of my workout with reasonable sound quality.  Also, this means that when I am sweaty, the sound quality will vary as I move my head around, since moving my head changes where the sweat runs; so if I bend over for a minute the sound will change, and when I straighten up it will change back."
2235,"Despite the clarity, there are white bleeds on the top and bottom of the display! If I wanted to watch something from a distance further then the chair I'm now sitting on, that becomes far more prevalent!Be careful for what you want this display for. I bought it for the 1080p Full HD angle of which I will be upgrading my computer soon for... but now..."
2236,I ordered these knowing that I needed a higher watt bulb.. these are most definitely very dull and not daylight bulbs so you will get a orange tint in your pictures. Definitely take the recommendations and get higher watts! The stands aren't very sturdy but they get the job done.. the screw handles fell apart in my hand.. so make sure you have a screw driver for back up. Also one BIG problem that I  noticed with these is there is NO backing so if you set up in a big open room the back of these are like 2 huge spot lights... so if your doing a event.. these aren't the lights for you!
2237,"While I was dissappointed in the packaging and resulting damage to one of two cases I purchased, I still like the cases.  Internally, they have multiple variations in style: Pick Foam, dividers, combination of the two, etc.  Externally, they have a timeless look, definitely adding favor to the contents.  The addition of a shoulder strap adds versatility.  I was very surprised at the depth of the case, considering it is touted as a ""small"" case.Definitely recommend these cases, providing you are not looking for major protective functions."
2238,"I bought this to work with my older Alpine Head Unit with iPod control.  When I bought the head unit and iPod control it was in the fire wire charging days of a like a gen 4 iPod.  It would not charge my gen 2 touch or my iPhone 4 (got them later).  I bought this adapter so I could charge my newer apple products.  This adapter works great to adapt and charge, I never had issues with airplane mode like others.  I did get a popup on the screen saying it wasn't a supported device but it worked fine.My biggest complaint is that the adapter does not fit well on the iPhone 4 with a small case on it.  The adapter doesn't stay in easily either so when listening to music if you bump the phone/iPod it will unplug.  The male end of this plug needs to be a little longer (milometer or so).  The fitment is really the only problem.  Correct that issue and it will be perfect."
2239,"Very very impressed with the size compared to other HD's. The enclosure seems durable.The cable doesn't seem to fit perfectly as it does not sit flushed with the case. But it works and holds none the less.Data transfer seems a bit lacking for a USB 3.0. This being compared to a WD Passport, their was significant difference when transferring files. Although it is still much faster than a regular USB 2.0, i felt it could be much better.The main reason I do not have a high rating for this device is because it seems to easily heat up. The metal enclosure seems to amplify, if not exert the build-up heat making it almost unbearable to touch."
2240,"Over the years, I've actually had three versions of the Flip HD camera through the last couple of years and so I guess I'd have to recommend it as a nice and compact starter camera.I'm going to be relatively brief in this synopsis as it looks like the technical pros and cons of this particular unit have been debated extensively. I have used several miniature camcorder devices (in addition to the Flip)in the past with varying degrees of success.  You can't always expect perfection from the smaller models. To me, it often comes down to a combination of pricing versus convenience versus clarity. How these elements balance out (and how important they are to you in the first place) tend to be the deciding factor in whether a particular camera does the job.I've come back to the Flip HD several times due to a number of reasons including easy and intuitive interface with my computer and good solid images.  I will be honest, though, the Flip HD does not have the greatest longevity for frequent usage.  If you want something to last years, I recommend you pay more money and shop a sturdier product.  This is neither the best or worst product, it is about what you would expect (if not slightly better) for the competitive price point.  For casual usage and with care, though, this should meet the requirements of the casual user.  4 stars for function, I'll deduct a star for longevity. KGHarris, 5/12."
2241,"For the amount that you get, the price is good.  I was expecting a little better quality/thicker sleeves.  These sleeves are incredibly thin, but do the job for now."
2242,the camera doesnt show in color. but at least i can see it at night with no lights on. so thats a plus. the range is decent. i can see to my back fence line. which by the way is approximately 75 feet away from where camera is posted.
2243,"Suggest Duracell AAA ""precharged"" rechargeable batteries:Our Panasonic original batteries (the ones that came with the phone) died quickly in one of our phones (the other phone is doing ok).  I'm sure the manufacturer would not recommend this, and you'd have to try it at your own risk, but we tried Duracell AAA ""precharged"" rechargeable batteries (these hold their charge for months) and so far they've been working great!  Nice thing is you can get these at most any store.  We just let them charge in the phone charger (e.g. we do not take them out to charge them separately in a Duracell charger) and they've been fine so far.This saved us hunting around for ""Panasonic specific"" batteries, hoping the were good quality, etc."
2244,"I received the light and it fits into my M-Edge cover perfectly, however I agree with some of the reviews that the light really does not illuminate the whole page and it doesn't stay put, due to the neck being too short and rigid. Also when you fold it down, it doesn't really lay flat, although it is no problem to close the cover. I love the M-Edge covers and own three of them, but this light needs to be improved. It will work if you don't care that you have to keep adjusting the position as you read. Hopefully they will come out with an improved version."
2245,Retractable cord works very well.  Only issue I have is mouse is much smaller then expected making it difficult to use.
2246,"I bought this with an Terk antenna, I haven't got it to work yet.  I'm trying to decide if its the tuner or the Terk.  I live in an apartment so it's hard to tell."
2247,The photo's i've taken so far don't meet quality expectations. The effect is there but the quality suffered more than I was expecting even after reviewing the samples others have taken. Maybe I just need more post processing. It is fun once in a while.
2248,"I've been doing videography for 5 years but I'm finishing up college, so I'm always looking for the most bang for my buck when buying camera/video equipment.These filters are a decent match for my (inexpensive) 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens and they generally do what they are intended to do. I'm careful with them and haven't had any issue with them regarding their quality. I believe they are built quite well (for the price) and the CPL filter spins nicely without being too loose.The CPL filter (Circular Polarizing) is my favorite when shooting anything that has the sky and grass in the shot (like shooting an outdoor event on my steadicam in a park, etc.). It makes the sky a beautiful blue, and the grass look nice and healthy green. It also takes parts of reflections out of almost anything but metals. During one shoot I was shooting through a glass door and showed my client the difference in the reflections as I turned the CPL filter. He was very impressed, and likes the video I did for him since you can actually see the person behind the door in that shot!The UV filter also has its' use. It can stay on your lens and protect it, and I've found that this lens actually helps make indoor shoots look a bit more natural with indoor lighting (admittedly an interesting fix) and this filter can also desaturate your image (could be good or bad depending on the application). This filter adds to lens glare though (at least mine does!), so be careful when shooting towards a light source.I only used the FLD filter to test it for this review and I find it absolutely unnecessary given modern DSLR technology. You can correct your white balance on camera, so you don't need to worry about converting your indoor florescent lights to daylight (mostly used for film).When I upgrade to a new lens (like the Canon 24-105mm f4L, I will buy a nicer CPL and UV filter. The UV to protect my lens and the CPL to handle outdoor/landscape/nasty reflections. I would want nice multi-coated glass filters on a nice lens, but these are fine for the less expensive Canon lenses.If you would like to see this equipment in action to better make a decision, you can find my youtube channel by searching jbhphotovideo in the youtube search box and going to that channel.I hope that helps!"
2249,"desde un inicio no hacia buen contacto, lo barato sale caro. . . . . . . . . ."
2250,I ordered two of these for my Jeep Wrangler.  Both units work well and the long video cable was a plus.  I tested the cameras with an LCD display and they look pretty good.  When I ran them via the Nav/Radio Screen the color green is gone and replaced by Gray.  I tested the radio with a JVC ([...] backup camera I bought several years ago and the same happened however I connected my go-pro to the unit and the colors are great.  Something with the resolution of the Camera and the resolution of the Nav Radio.  The wide angle could be a bit better but then again I paid 199.00 for the JVC and the price is still the same in Crutchfield.  So far two weeks and the camera is holding okay.  The gridlines are nice to have.  I just wished it worked better with the radio but in my opinion it is not the cameras.  Why not 5 stars? because even with a different LCD the colors weren't great.  I bought two and will keep them.  I will post some images in Company A Customer Images.
2251,It's low priced and worth every penny. I could not detect any signal boost between my microphone and DSLR. You get what you pay for!
2252,"I previously owned a speck seethru satin touch case. I had it for about 9 months and it starts to worn out a little. one of the tabs to hold on to MBP broke.I found this case and figured it has better features. I ended up have to return it right away. The case has 2 tabs locate at the hinge of their bottom part. Every time I open the laptop the hinge will scratch the tabs and make cracking sound.... like when you pull velcro apart. Tabs on the top part are on the sides. When you open the laptop, you hold on to the area near the camera.... there're nothing to hold on to MBP on that area so the cover bend. You have to be careful with it otherwise it will pop out...it's hard to explain.In short, if they move tabs location, this would make a great case..... until then, i'm going to stay with Speck cases."
2253,"Cheap materials were used to make this it seems. Squeaks with the lightest amount of pressure, the big gray keys next to the thumb stick get stuck, and the lcd screen broke on me. Never abused, or hit. Maybe I bought a lemon.The macros are very nice to have, the layout is nice as well. I just have a problem with the cheap parts that were used with this product. Sweaty finger tips are a nightmare with this. Defnnitely not worth the $60 retail price. I give it $40 tops."
2254,"I just purchased an iPOD classic to replace my old one and this cover is okay. I like the way that it looks because of the dark color, but it already had scratches in it by the second day that I put it on. That bummed me out, but I will keep it , because my iPOD is still in great shape. It also comes with a film to cover the screen , back, and click wheel."
2255,"After reading the glowing reviews, I was really excited to try this product. We have ethernet cables run to the main locations in the house and we also have wireless, but I thought this product would be great for those times when I was in an unnetworked room but wanted something faster than wireless. Mike, the house tech guru, was curious to see how well it actually worked.[Mike now] We had been having some intermittent network issues in the room with the media center extender, so we were hoping that perhaps going through the powerline adapter we could circumvent the problem. The powerline adapter installation was a breeze and everything seemed to work fine, until we fired up the media center extender... For whatever reason it had problems communicating with our media center pc through the powerline adapter. So it seems as though it works fine in a simple networking environment (surfin' the web and filesharing) but it had problems when things got a little complex."
2256,"It's okay. Carries my laptop with a minimum of fuss, but I'm going to be looking for another. I really don't like the swivel-snap that holds the bag's flap. It's so big that the flap bulges out at that spot and it's very deep in from the edge, so that you have to bend the flap back to get at it. I can see this creasing or damaging the flap over time."
2257,"Please note that this camera does not shoot in HIGH DEFINITION.The idea of migrating the storage of camcorder shots to an internal memory was very appealing with this camera.  It stores up 16GB and there is a slot to add an SD card. Hence, there is no extra cost in buying an SD card, which is not the case for all camcorders in the same price range.What we liked about the camcorder- very light, very easy to hold and shoot.- has a built in lense cap, which is terrific and mades the whole design have a much cleaner finish.  Also, when you switch the camcorder on, it will tell you when you have not opened the lense cap!- built in 16GB of ram and a slot to add an SD card- a visible botton on the outside that allows you to choose between using the a) camcorder b) camera c) watch the movies stored- the menu is very user friendly and some of the options we liked include:i) grids to help you frame your shotii) focus that allows for auto focusing, face recognition or manual focusingiii) simpe scence shot options: sports or portraitsIV) has anti shake option, which comes in handy if you are using the zoom (also see below for the not so great bits about the zoom).vi) up load to utube is very easyv) cuts on wind noise (it works and reduces the muffle sound)vii) the program for editing your shot is very simple, as the intention is to allow you to edit (if any) before loading to utube or send it for friends/family to see.  If you are looking for a more sophicated finish then you need to buy a separate program.Maybe it is the price bracket this camcorder falls within, but we would have liked to see improvements in the following:- the zoom feature is great to a point, but if you plan to use it to its full capacity then I would recommend that you use a tripod.  Otherwise, the whole shot comes out very 'shakened'.- we noticed that the zoom button was more sensitive compared with other camcorders in the same price range, which made it very difficult to zoom in and out without you feeling that you were travelling through the stargate!- the camcorder and camera options are best used in good lighting.  Not advisable for low lighting events.- no flash light."
2258,"I bought this TV for the price. It was an upgrade to a 7 inch that I receive as a gift.It's OK, but it not a HDTV!The picture is a little too dark for me.The only way you can add channels is with the auto scan. Once the auto scan has completed, you can not additional channels.The battery life is not long. But the battery will charge while watching TV.There is only one AV in jack and a jack for ear plugs. It doesn't have a HDMI jack.For the price this is a OK TV."
2259,"Had I written this review, say a half-year ago, I would have undoubtedly given the Macbook 5 stars. I took it with me to college after my previous laptop - an Acer Aspire - failed me horribly. My Aspire had an issue with overheating, which only presented itself after my warranty expired. The cost of repairing it was not worth it when compared to getting a new laptop that was smaller, lighter, more powerful, and more capable of multi-tasking (more RAM).I come from a family that has been using Macs for over a decade, although I myself preferred Windows computers...up until Windows Vista came out. We had many Macs around the house growing up since my parents use Macs in their office, and I was never really impressed with the Apple Operating System, so I had doubts about the Macbook. But since the Macbook is loaded with 2GB RAM and an Intel processor, you can run BOTH Mac AND Windows operating systems with ease. I therefore figured worse comes to worst, I'll use my Macbook as a laptop to run Windows XP with. I used it very heavily in college and it served me very well. It's light weight allowed me to easily carry it from class to class, its included photo and video editing software gave me hours of productivity, and perhaps best of all, it was reliable! I really loved my Macbook and would like to give it 5 stars...but...My sister, who was in graduate school, also got a Macbook at the same time I got mine. Her laptop fared well, up until the end of last year. For some reason, the laptop started getting buggy...it'd freeze, it would overheat, it became a major nuisance. We've reformatted several times, hoping that would solve the problems, but to no avail. I HIGHLY recommend getting the AppleCare protection plan. We regrettably didn't, and really don't feel like forking over the money to repair the Macbook since she doesn't use it much anymore anyway. But our attempt to save money by not getting the protection plan will end up costing us more money now, should we choose to repair the laptop! The experience with our second, identical Macbook, is why I have to give 3 stars instead of 5 for an otherwise strong performance product, that can run both Windows and Mac, that comes bundled with a lot of great software, and that looks really cool (especially on a college campus where almost everyone has Macs!)A last note...I have more recently purchased the sleeker Macbook, and would like to emphasize that while its construction is nicer, and it doesn't look as cheap as this plastic one, I still think this is a good deal. If you're looking to ""wow"" people and can splurge, get the newer model, but if you are looking for a powerful laptop and don't care too much about having the latest build, this one is just fine. I still use my plastic one even though I have the newer (cooler-looking!) one."
2260,I'm using this cooler on a Corei7-3770K and a ASUS Sabertooth Z77 Motherboard.It works very well keeping it cool even during some overclocking. It has gone up to about 4.5Ghz at moments and runs solid.My only complaint is at low fan speed it has a slight wobble.
2261,"Seems to work well and more options than I have time to deal with.  I don't think I would buy again.  After 15 years of using bulldog alarms on all my cars (3 at any one time) I got spoiled.  I forgot what a pain in the butt hard wired alarms were.  If all you want is an alarm that works well and a fast installation, a Bulldog two wire 3 screw 20 min install is the only way to go.  I've had Bulldogs that have lasted through 3 cars and worked great, but its just an alarm.  This has a lot of options but I am leery about its quality and if its worth the work to install it, if it doesn't last."
2262,"It's good for the price but...  The dome light structure broke as I struggled to put it together.  It's still usable, but just a little wonky.  Light quality is excellent, and I'm still happy to use these over paying high-dollar rates for other brands.  I should also add that they stay in the studio, so I'm not confident that they would survive someone who has to take them down and travel with them a lot."
2263,"This product helps boost the level of music, but on a bike the sound of wind still is louder and I wear a full face helmet. I think it's best to by a helmet with speaker system built in."
2264,Probably my fault.  This item is evidentally for an older model Zune than I own.  I was blinded by the steal of a deal and didn't pay attention to details.
2265,The cable was not as described...it was not gold plated but didn't really matter as I was using it to connect a ir  to a reciever in another room.  The lenth was as described and for the money you can't beat it.
2266,"I really like the PalmGuard, it actually provides a bit more friction and so it prevents the base of your palms from slipping around on the almost too-smooth palm rest of the MacBook Pro.  It also seems like it has a bit of padding in it, even though it is paper-thin.  Not sure how that could be possible, but oh well.  I'm still looking for something that can dull the sharp edges of the palm rest itself, it cuts into my wrists.The track pad protector leaves a lot to be desired.  It adds a nice bit of friction which actually improves tracking.  However, if you use double-tap to do stuff, you'll have problems because you have to tap very hard.  This was a show-stopper for me, so I pulled it off.  For those who don't use double-tap I think it would work out pretty good, although two finder scrolling is also a bit non-responsive."
2267,"This is my second Grundig radio,the first being a S350 Field Radio. I had problems with that ,also! The little GM400 showed promise. I never actually auditioned one but did so on its predecessor,I believe the 300. Not sure! but it sounded pretty good for a small radio. This one sounds ok,also. It is what it is. You cannot expect big sound from a small radio. But my criticism is not about the sound quality. It is about the reception. This radio appears only able to receive strong stations. I have a Delphi XM radio that I often use to transmit FM throughout the house. It has a range of about 30 ft. Every other radio I own,including a LifeLong baby Boombox,(a gift),is capable of receiving the FM broadcast by my XM radio,but not this Grundig. A major disapointment for a prestigous name!"
2268,I simply can't understand the time for shipping.  It works but if you're 73 like I am you might want to consider looking else where.  Hard little guy to find but if you just gotta have it go ahead and order this one and wait.
2269,"Just plug in this drive to the power outlet and your router and it shows up as network drive on all the network computers and even in iTunes. On Windows it shows 3 folders: Public, Download & Configuration and on Mac the only first two. I have not been able to create custom folders yet and may have to dig the manual on how to do that. So far, I have also not been able to figure out how to secure the back up data.The backup software worked well on Mac. It automatically backs up in the background like Time Machine. But this drive does not work with Time Machine itself on Mac. Apple technical support informed me that Time Machine works with USB drives and the only network drive Time machine works with is Time Capsule!On Windows, the software is so painfully slow that I gave up and have not been able to test it yet. Neither have I tested the remote access through Mionet. The hard drive goes to sleep if it is not used for a while and disconnects from the network. Then you have to turn it off and on again to connect to the network.You can also attach a USB drive to MyBook drive's USB port to extend storage. But this drive itself does not work as a USB drive. Overall, it works well as Network Attached Storage.UPDATE 5/16/2009: I downloaded the latest version of WD Anywhere Bckup for Windows and it is much faster and works really well. But you cannot customize backup. You can specify what files you want to back up, like Word document, Excel spreadsheet etc. but it won't let you backup custom folders that are not part of My Documents.6/14/2009: I have still not been able to secure the data, create custom folders or customize the backup and if anyone knows how to do that, I will appreciate your comments. But I have tried remote access on Mionet and it works. Again, you cannot selectively provide remote access to specific folders. Basic Mionet access is included with the drive, but Mionet keeps on annoyingly nagging you to pay for premium access.10/10/2010: Now they have made My Book compatible with Time Machine and you have to do a firmware upgrade. With my three computers and using this hard drive as a DVR withElgato EyeTV 250 Plus Digital/Analog TV Receiver and Video Converter, I was reaching the 1 TB capacity and had a choice of either upgrading My Book to 2 GB hard drive which you can do by replacing the hard drive;or going for a new network storage and I chose the later because Western Digital backup software, both Windows & Mac really slows down your computer. Western Digital listens to the users and except for speed they have solved most of the original complaints since this review appeared year and half ago.The speed of file transfer also depends on the processor, RAM and operating system in NAS and the first two you cannot change. So I upgraded toSynology DiskStation 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS210+ (Black), which is more expensive than My Book and harder to set up but has a faster processor and more RAM and is a lot faster and more expandable. For those using network drives for media storage to use with DLNA compatible media players, speed and expandability are very important. And if this My Book is a knife then Synology 210+ is a Swiss Army Knife of network storage.  There is probably not a network function that it does not have. It can do it all - network hard drive, Mac Time Machine, automatic backup, internet access for files, Android & iPhone apps for accessing music and video, DLNA compatible home media server, ftp server, IP camera surveillance, one touch picture upload from camera, USB print server, eSATA USB port, iTunes server, mail station, and some more.If you want a network drive that is easy to set up and use and does just the network backup without extra functionality, go forWestern Digital My Book World Edition 1 TB Network Attached Storage WDH1NC10000N (White).  But if you are handy with computer hardware and software and need more network functionality, speed and expandability go for one of the Synology units."
2270,"The battery pack works as advertised.  No problem with proper fit.  Although we don't use the computer often, it seems to hold a charge well."
2271,"I haven't tested this in water yet, but wanted to leave information on my initial take.  It is of much lower quality than what I was thinking it might be (granted, I bought the cheapest, so I'm not surprised).  It shipped from China, which I wasn't expecting.  All things considered it got here fairly quickly (about 3 weeks), but I was pretty worried when I saw it would be shipping internationally less than a month from the trip I was buying it for.  Don't expect this to make it to you much quicker than 3 weeks.  I didn't see anything, anywhere in the description that indicated it would be sent internationally."
2272,"I bought these headphones to back up and eventually replace the ones that came with my Panasonic Cassette tape players (I sure wish they still made those). The sound is good and they are reasonably comfortable; however, the Panasonic headphones that came with the player are better. It is perhaps an unfair comparison because those Panasonic headphones were superb compared with those of any price. Anyway, these Sennheisers will do, although I suspect there are better ones for less money."
2273,"I got this to do two things only: tell me the time (without me needing to put my glasses on) and read me a bedtime story (audiobooks ripped from CD). It is almost perfect for those purposes, but I'm surprised at all these glowing reviews, because the unit is not without real flaws. The only two that concern me are that the display, while large and clear, cannot be seen if you're lying down and your bedside table is at the same level as your head. From all other angles the display is perfectly clear, but to see the time without sitting up, I need to lean the unit towards me at a sharp angle.The other niggle that bothers me is that the [Sleep] button is on the back (Why?) and is the middle of three identical buttons, so care is needed. Did the designers think that people would confuse [Snooze] with [Sleep]? If so, they could have come up with more unambiguous labels, like [It's too f*?#!+@ early!] and [Drift Off...]Two other flaws that don't concern me but would probably matter to most people: In terms of volume, it doesn't exactly ""go to eleven""; all it can manage is about four. The other one is that, though the sound quality is as excellent as reported in the other reviews, there is a serious lack of bass, leaving it sounding only like a set of five dollar computer speakers.It does everything else just fine, is truly portable and lightweight, takes up very little space, and is constructed really well.(I can't comment on the alarm function because I would never rely on anything this complex to wake me up: if I absolutely, positively have to be awake at a certain time, my yard-sale Westclox gets wound up, armed, and placed on the other side of the room. I then go to sleep, serenaded by its hellacious loud tick, secure in the knowledge that - come Hell or high water (or power outages) - I will be awake and standing at the right time next morning.)"
2274,"Some of pros include the look of the speakers, gloss black looks awesome with the touch of metallic silver knobs and orange/yellow cones. Personally I like the mesh on top just as extra protection. Easy setup, I didn't even need to use the manual to set it up since I've had similar speaker systems in past.The only real con was the bass, whenever it tries to play music with hard hitting bass the other sounds gets mushed together. This is probably because it's trying to create the lows and mids in the same orange cones. The other issue was that when you first turn on the speakers and turn it up, it takes a second to actually play the sound. So just turn it up slowly and you'll be fine.* Update: After using these for a few months, I noticed that sometimes it makes a fuzzy noise when playing higher sounds at low volume. To fix, I simply have to turn it up to a medium level. So beware of that, it started around the 2nd months, which was past the original month so I can't return it anymore. Also Company A doesn't allow returns for this due to the magnets in the speaker being a safety hazard during shipping, so you might want to buy at a local store if your unsure."
2275,"We ordered three of these for use in our office.  Turns out they are not compatible with Macintosh computers, because Macs lack a microphone input jack (the line-in jack does not amplify the signal enough).  For a while I was fooled into thinking they were working, but I realized that Skype was just using the Mac's built-in mic instead. (forehead slap)Incompatibility with Mac would have been nice to know before buying, Company A.  [...]  Although to be fair it's not just this model, apparently USB headsets are the only kind that will work on a Mac.Otherwise, the ergonomics seem fine for this price range.  Audio quality through headphones seems quite good, inline headphone volume and microphone sensitivity/mute settings is nice (with shirt clip).  Wish we could keep them."
2276,"I love the wireless keyboard. It is quiet, and comfortable, and lots of customizable keys. The mouse is a huge problem for me. The main problem is the scroll. It doesn't click like the common mouses. As a fan of Microsoft products, I am very disappointed by the scroll of the mouse. The Bluetrack technology is very good, but the scroll is still a problem, for both everyday tasks and gaming."
2277,"quality of the microphone is 5 starsquality of the sound is 5 starsbut you cannot have it over your ears more than 5 minutes cause it's not comfortable. it is great for a short call with skype, but if you are going into a conference call, you will need to move it away from your ears after a while"
2278,"Background: I'm a loyal canon user and have owned many canon digital cameras, both powershots and SLR's.Review of Canon SD 960ISPros:1. HD movies at 720p. Great movies with image stabilization.2. Wide angle. Equivalent to  28mm. Great for taking pictures of yourself and friends/family as well as landscape shots.3. Attractive design.Cons:1. Focus issues: You must press the shutter button halfway before each shot for properly focused pictures. This is no problem when the owner is shooting, but if you are asking a stranger to take your picture (when traveling this happens a lot), you will get blurry shots.2. Button layout: Too easy to accidentely change the setting for flash, etc. without knowing it. I lent this camera to my parents who accidently turned off the flash and couldn't take any nightime pics for the whole weekend. The old SD870is was better in this regard.3. Movie modes: the time lapse movie mode is no longer available on this model. This was a fun mode that was available on previous models.Conclusion:Decent camera with HD movies and wide angle.Just be aware of it's drawbacks before you buy it."
2279,"A great, large case for the money and first time builder of PC gaming towers. Plenty of room, lots of fan options.My only problem is that the front case latching were all busted on the bottom when I took it out of the box. The shipping box was severely destroyed as well - perhaps therein lies the answer. But because it will not affect the case's primary function, and it's for me, I felt no need to return it for the hassle of getting another one. Perhaps if the case exceeded $150, but not for this bad boy. Would I recommend it? For the price and roominess, yes."
2280,"WHO NEEDS IT?This cable will work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4a standard of which it is a PARTIAL implementation (no Ethernet). If what you need is a true HDMI 1.4x cable, then the one to get is that which is described as ""HDMI with Internet"" which adds the data channel and support for higher video resolutions.You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support the HDMI 1.4 standard such as TVs, receivers or Blu-ray players. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and will allow you TV to send audio data BACK to your receiver if so connected, therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated audio cable. This specific cable will probably NOT support HDMI 1.4 Ethernet feature. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4-ready hardware in the near future.Unless either of the above is true, you will not need this cable and, given that the HDMI 1.4 standards aren't set in stone yet - this cable complies with the recently released HDMI 1.4a specs for 3D - you should be better off waiting for the dust to settle. Keep in mind that BOTH connected devices need to support the HDMI 1.4 standard for this cable to make a difference and that it is NOT possible to upgrade any existing equipment (TV, Blu-ray player) to support HDMI 1.4.HOW GOOD IS IT?On my equipment, this worked as well as any older HDMI 1.3x cable. It replaced an existing 'cheap' wire at the back of my entertainment center and, nothing unexpected happened. The picture on my TV was as beautiful as before. The cable's short length (2 meters) and its 'high speed' certification make me confident that this cable will serve me well.Briefly, this cable:- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable. If all you need is HDMI 1.3x then go for it or go for any other cheap HDMI 1.3x wire.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p including in 3D.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) is missing but it that would only work with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment so I'm not sure if it would be missed for the next couple of years.- The advertised audio return channel is another HDMI 1.4 feature that most currently owned equipment can't take advantage of.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment NOT by the cable.WHY 3 STARSA 3-star rating should be fair (and I am not factoring in the price) because this cable, while working perfectly as an HDMI 1.3x, is an incomplete HDMI 1.4 implementation. Incomplete HDMI 1.4 implementations are allowed by the HDMI consortium but there I see no advantage in purchasing a feature-crippled cable when full-featured alternatives are available. 'Niche' HDMI cables make sense form a vendor's point of view because a buyer may be willing to pay more for such an item but their marketing can only confuse and annoy the buyers. It should cost a vendor about the same to manufacture a 'universal' HDMI 1.4 wire as it does to make an incomplete (niche) product. In fact there may be economies of scale in producing 'universal' HDMI 1.4 cables only so marketing seems to be the only reason we get to see these intentionally crippled products.My recommendation would be NOT to buy this cable. Get the 'High-Speed with Ethernet' if you want/need HDMI 1.4 or get an HDMI 1.3x otherwise.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET (NOT supported by this specific product) means that a cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel (supported) would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices, usually a TV that might get content directly from a USB storage device or the Ethernet and an HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver.- HDMI 1.4a brought HDMI in line with the recently agreed upon 3D TV industry standards but, consistent with HDMI's consortium's encouraging vendors to avoid talking about the actual version their HDMI cables are implementing, we simply don't know whether this one is HDMI 1.4 or HDMI 1.4a. Since '3D' is mentioned it's probably safe to assume HDMI 1.4a.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p. Be aware that there are now THREE different HDMI connectors: standard, mini and micro.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf all of the above, only the a 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' makes sense.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;"
2281,"Update: 03-11-2011Recently I moved to east coast (50 miles of NYC). I was able to tune in to ""Vividh Bharati"" in the morning. It recieved lots and lots of SW frequency here (many europian and middle east). SO it depends on where you live and the surroundings/topology of your home locations.June 06, 2010:I receieved mine yesterday. It was shipped and delivered 3 days ealier than the estimated(and I like Company A). I am new to dxing and wanted to try one with this Kaito KA1102. The AM and FM worked fine(better than my Panasonic Walkman with AM/FM). But on the SW band, I could not get single channel that is audilble. I have scanned all the frequencies from 3.0 to 23.0 Mhz in all meter band. The signal strengh indicator shows full strenght but they are all static. I am not sure if mine is defective or not.If anybody owns this product in seattle area and could get SW station, please let me know so that I will return ASAP."
2282,"Works as expected and the shipping speed was right on time. A bit over priced in my opinion, but what cables aren't nowadays.My reviews are kept up to date if/when the product malfunctions, breaks, or functions less than reasonable expectations hold overtime."
2283,Arrived promply.  Well packaged.  Had one spot of defect that did not affect install or operation. Install went well.  Have 24 inch stud spacing so had to put in a brace which I expected.  As indicated in other reviews it is heavy and requires two people to install.  Operation is stiff but works fine otherwise.  Mounted a 43 inch flat screen.
2284,"These little adapters worked well for my scenario. I needed them because the HDMI ports in my Samsung Plasma are on the back, and I was trying to mount the TV as close to the wall as possible. Because of this, there wasn't enough room for standard cables to ""bend"" after getting plugged in. These adapters did the trick. The only downside is they are extremely easy to bend and/or damage accidentally (i.e. the male end bends out of the plastic housing too easily in my opinion). Otherwise, these are a great buy at a great price."
2285,"Pros:Thin and clean appearance. No logos to be found anywhere.Very similar to Moshi's offering, but only costing half.Cons:The fit could be better, with almost 1/16"" side to side play/shift.The bottom edge on mine is not cut at a straight line. With the premium pricing, quality should be better.Ships in a tube, might have caused some minimum distortion to the cover due to it being rolled up. Moshi's Cleargard ships flat.Other notes:Made in Korea"
2286,"First the good - the base is as solid as the video and reviews say it is.  No leakage or seeping of liquids will happen via the base of the case, that's for sure!  Opens easily, good zippers and handle.  Top is well padded.  Solid construction and workmanship is very good.Now the problems - the should strap is garbage - period.  The side pockets are only good for batteries or filters.  The case is not deep enough for a Pentax K-x with 50-300mm zoom (it bottoms out).  The space on either side of the lens under the suspension area is wasted unless you want things slamming into your lens because there is NO padding or retention strap for anything you put in that area.If you want to carry 1 camera with a small to intermediate zoom, a few batteries and filters and thats about it - get this but plan to replace the strap immediately.  Otherwise, keep looking - I am."
2287,Was not what I expected maybe I read the specifications wrong but It did not last long sorry will not purchase this
2288,"I've had this a while now. The sound quality is not good, nor has it ever been. Now after 4 years I am getting a gray shawdow in the middle of the screen. I know Samsung is supposed to be best, I bought 4 of them from 22&#34; to 51&#34; when I go to replace this one it will not be Samsung and I am sorry about that. I don't like rethinking decisions."
2289,I had this speaker set up to my phone in my dorm while in training and worked great for what it is.  The sound isn't THAT loud but its better than a phone speaker.  It worked great for a while but after awhile it got distorted and I don't even use it anymore.  Great for the place and while it lasted.
2290,"I bought this for my new Sony HX5v, based on another reviewer who said it's a good, tight fit. It's too tight of a fit for me, and I feel like the zipper will wear a spot on the camera since it rubs against the corner of the camera when closing and opening the pouch.Other than that, it just seems to be of super-low quality. The stitching is uneven, and it simply exudes a certain cheapness I'm not too keen on. But then again, it is quite cheap. The zipper on the outside pocket keeps getting stuck, and I've barely even used this thing.Overall, while it's functional, and, I suppose, not bad for the price, I wouldn't recommend it."
2291,"I snagged this bag for the netbook I bought the wife to take to Europe -- hoping she could carry the computer and use it as a purse as well. The bag is a bit small to make that happen, but it does work well if all you want to do is carry your netbook and a few accessories.Pros:Not huge.Well constructed.Gender neutral.Cons:Forget carrying lots of accessories -- a smallish AC adapter, power cord and a small mouse are a tight fit.Strap adjuster often moves when you bump it.The circular carabiners attaching the strap can open on their own, causing a nasty drop."
2292,"A lot of problems with the included adapter /0.5A/ !!! When I replaced it with 1A ,now it's Perfect!"
2293,"I got this card free with an order of Crucial DDR2 laptop memory.  For what it's worth, it works fine.  I find that it is very slow.  I transfered 3.5 GB of info to it in order to take it with me to another computer and it took about 1.5 hours!  I guess it would work fine as a removable backup or in a digital camera that is not used for rapid shots.  Don't even try to use it in a digital video camera.  It would be way too slow.  Also, keep in mind that this is a SDHC card not a SD card so it will not work in older cameras or it will not be readable on older computers that only have SD card readers."
2294,"Hum... like many other buyers my Exp is 2015. Less then 5 year from now.  I believe seller probably got the battery cheap and a little old, therefore the price is not bad.  But if by 2015 the unused batteries are not as fully charged as it should be, i will probably not buy this again with the same seller unless the seller can guarantee the batteries we get is the newer batteries with exp date at least 8 years away."
2295,"takes very good pictures, but once it froze during a trip and would not start againafter 45 minutes after it completely froze with the lens protruding it started to work again out of the blueIt's a good camera for less than a hundred dollars the big lens makes for very good pictures.and people think its a joke that it is a GE. Good thing their plane turbines won't freeze like this camera didonce."
2296,"I outgrew my old sandisk with the secure software so I purchased this one.  The flash drive itself is fine but the secure software sucks !  There's complaints about it all over the internet on forums which I missed before the purchase.  Its bogs down my desktop and laptop, takes forever to load and doesnt seem stable.  I havent contacted sandisk but after reading all those forum posts, I think I will stay away from software and continue using the flash drive as standard."
2297,"Had to replace my last Cruzer so I got this one. But the software in it doesn't work like it should and I can't password protect it. It does hold a lot of data, but I'm already looking for one that I can secure."
2298,"This product does a great job at protecting your mac. Snaps on perfectly and keeps the metal finish nice and what not. The plastic itself is a cheap grade, feels kind of clunky, and aesthetically, doesn't do much. Maybe should have tried another color. Again, for the price, a good protection for your machine."
2299,I replaced my broken Sennheiser headset with this one. The first thing I noticed is the sound. Not so great and then then comfort of the headset. Again not so good. The solid plastic speaker presses on the ear and becomes uncomfortable to downright painful by the time a movie is finished playing.The price is very good but not good enough to keep this set as my primary headset. I reordered a replacement Sennheiser even though the cost is relatively high. BTW the other comments about charging a right on. It took many trys to get the headset to sit properly on the charger pins. Poor design!
2300,"I should preface this by saying that I'm not one of those people that bash 3rd party lenses because of some misguided brand loyalty. When I first started shooting professionally I had to stretch every dollar I made and buy what I could afford and not necessarily what I wanted long term. I've owned several Tamron lenses, 28-75, 17-50, the discontinued and legendary 17-35, and lastly this 60/2.0.When I bought this I was still using a crop camera body as my secondary/backup. I shoot mainly weddings/engagements/general portraiture and I occasionally need a macro lens (ring shots, some food, etc). But since I was on a tight budget and my macro use was limited I figured this lens could double as a portrait lens because of that tempting f/2.0 aperture. I had had good experiences with other Tamron lenses so I bought it.On the good side I liked how well the lens was built for the price, the distance scale and big comfy focus ring were nice touches. The f/2 aperture was fantastic of course and I was surprised to find that it was really really sharp as well. Even wide open. I would compare it to the Canon 85/1.8 in term of sharpness, color and contrast. Image quality was not an issue at all.But of course there was a major down side... it just... couldn't... focus... at all. Even in good light it would hunt and hunt and hunt. When it did finally find its spot it was generally accurate, but I just didn't always have the time and/or patience for that. I used the lens several times for personal stuff, just playing around and exploring the world of macro, etc. But I only used it on a paid shoot once. I was shooting some upper body portraits, in good light, and it just kept hunting and hunting. My client actually laughed at one point and asked if it was broken because she could hear it hunting to find a focus point for so long (yeah, its really loud as well). Finally I just switched to manual focus and had to use live view to zoom and make sure I got it right. It was slightly embarrassing and extremely frustrating.If I was just shooting for fun or only using it for macro shots of still life I would have probably kept the lens and been happy with it, but it just wasn't reliable enough for paid work. All of those other Tamron lenses I mentioned before, although they had some flaws, were still very capable and reliable lenses. This lens did not live up to that standard.In summary, if you're just looking for a macro lens for personal use or you don't mind using manual focus with regularity, you'll probably be happy with this lens. However, if you're like I was and you see that affordable price tag with that tempting f/2.0 aperture for portraits, you might want to take a pass and sacrifice that extra f-stop for something with a better focusing system."
2301,"After reading some of the other reviews, I've concluded that I got one of the 'soft' lenses...meaning that the majority of the time, images don't turn out as clear as they do/did with the Canon kit lens.  But, honestly, what do you expect for $200 glass?  I'd say it's worth it for the price if that's your budget and you need a kit lens replacement. I've heard great stuff about Sigma and wanted to give them a shot with something small before getting their 10-22mm or other more expensive lenses...this, however, didn't fully convince me that they're on par with Canon, but I appreciate the potential they provide for competitive pricing."
2302,"First of all a little background on my past HDTVs as of recent.Panasonic 50"" 850u series - All around good tv.Sony 50"" XBR6 - Great picture from HD sources, poor from standard sources.  Returned in two weeks.Pioneer Kuro 5020 50"" - Excellent picture from HD sources, great from standard definition as well. DEAD SILENT, Excellent sound. Decided to sell after 8 months to ""upgrade"" to a Samsung LED. I REGRET getting rid of this Pioneer.Samsung 7000 series 46"" LED - Excellent picture from HD, and good from standard.  Viewing angles are poor, sound is poor, HT speakers are a must.  Which brings me to go back to a plasma, to get that great contrast ratio & excellent viewing angles.Samsung 50"" 860 series - ""sigh""  First of all this has an excellent picture quality from HD sources & great from standard. The blacks are not as good as the Kuro I had, but they were good to satisfy your standard users. Never tested the audio, but if it's the same as the LED series, then I would say it's not acceptable.  The styling is great, as slim as the LED lcds.Now the cons, as already mentioned, there is a slight HIGH pitched buzz, as some have already described it as a ""florescent light"". This is very aggravating since I have this TV in a small dedicated HT room 14x14x8 during low volume it is noticeable.  Although, I didn't really think this was a deal breaker for me, the HEAT this thing puts out was.  I've owned several plasmas, so I was aware that plasma do run warm, but this Samsung puts out some serious heat.  Therefore the SLIGHT high pitch buzz & the hot operating temps caused me to contact Company A for a return.If Samsung designs better cooling and eliminates the buzz, this TV will be a home run."
2303,"I think the ANT751 is a good, compact antenna and would work well in certain circumstances, but it ended up not being well suited to my circumstances, which are considerably less than ideal.  Even though I'm only about 10 miles from most of the broadcasting stations here in the Seattle suburbs, I have the antenna in an attic crawlspace, there is a hill between me and the transmitters, and there are trees in the way.I originally bought the RCA ANT751 antenna because it's compact and well-regarded, but I ended up with multipath problems (go figure, given my circumstances).  I decided to try the Antennas Direct DB4 with the thinking that a more robust, specialized UHF antenna might help, and it did.  With the DB4, I have strong, rock-solid reception on the UHF channels now, even when the trees are blowing around in the winter.  Like the ANT751, the DB4 is compact enough to fit easily in my attic.  Note that all of the relevant UHF transmitters are in the same spot in Seattle, so I don't have the problem of having signals coming from different compass points.As the Antennas Direct DB4 is a UHF-only antenna, I still had the problem of VHF reception.  I solved this by combining the RCA ANT751 with the Antennas Direct DB4 via a UHF-VHF combiner (a $5 part which I got from an electronics specialty store).  The combiner strips the UHF signal from the RCA ANT751, leaving only the VHF signal (and strips the VHF signal from the DB4, if there was any), and sends the combined signal to my TV.  This setup gave me the rock-solid UHF from the DB4 with the pretty good VHF from the ANT751, and as an added bonus I can point the ANT751 toward the most relevant VHF transmitter in my area to optimize that signal.The above setup served me well for VHF signals within the range of the ANT751, but eventually I decided that I wanted to access a VHF signal that was out of reach of the ANT751, so I replaced it with a longer, stronger dedicated yagi-style VHF-only antenna whose signal I combine with the DB4 as described above.  It was much harder to fit this longer, wider antenna into the attic than was the case for the ANT751, but I eventually got it pointed right and I'm getting strong, reliable signals from all of the stations I care about in this market.Among my learnings - keep the antenna at least 3 feet away from electrical wires.  There are electical cables in my attic that run along the attic floor, and I got better performance by mounting the ANT751 up and away from them.I do amplify the signal coming from the UHF-VHF combiner with the Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier.  I probably don't need it for the UHF portion of the signal from the DB4, which is pretty strong, but I definitely needed it for marginal VHF signals coming from the ANT751 before I swapped it out.  I split the signal quite a few times inside the house, and the booster helps with that.Overall, I like the ANT751, but it wasn't ideal for my circumstances.  If you have circumstances that are less prone to multipath, it might be a good choice for you."
2304,"I have one major problem with this wall mount. I put it on a Vizio 16"" LCD HDTV. The back mounting plate half covers the HDMI Input Connector of this TV making it impossible to use."
2305,this charger fully charges my Midnight Company C E5400 in less than 40-45 minutes. THAT IS SUPER FAST.... BUT.. this charger heats up a lot. it comes to a point where i think if this charger will cause a electric fire or something. i dont know the chance of this charger burning up and causing your house to burn but DEFINITELY DO NOT KEEP THIS CHARGER PLUGGED INTO THE OUTLET AND THE LAPTOP SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE THE BATTERY IS FULL. im saying this is again DO NOT KEEP THIS CHARGER PLUGGED INTO THE OUTLET AND THE LAPTOP SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE THE BATTERY IS FULL.. that is when the charger heats up a lot. maybe cause the battery gets full and the battery/laptop denies the exterior outlet power.
2306,"3 Stars for neutral.  Haven't had occasion to actually use it. Just want to alert others since I didn't check carefully.No doubt this case is as advertised, it is well made and good looking, but  ...  be aware that it ONLY carries the tripod, NO HEAD!!If you, like me, leave the heads on your tripod for normal use, a bummer :-(The ""sack"" that comes with the tripod along with the same for the head makes a nice combo."
2307,"I am disappointed in the mushy sound. (I have a much cheaper ""skull candy"" headset with better sound quality.) The 3 button apple control is uncomfortably close to my head and cannot be lowered to where I can see it better. In my opinion not worth the purchase price."
2308,"Although the manual for Samsung's BD-P1590 states that it is compatible only with their LAN adapter, I was able to use an old D-Link wireless print server to connect the disc player to my wireless network. Works just fine. Saved myself $80 which is a lot considering that the Blu Ray player costs only $180. I'm sure that there are also other similar solutions. Good Luck.Jimp.s. Love the Netflix streaming video with this player."
2309,"My first 1 star review is below, and I still think the instructions are horrible and Silex customer service takes 3 days to call you back.  (Hopefully you're there to answer the phone and at your computer.)  Anyway, I had to call Canon to get my USB connection working directly after messing with the Silex software and found out that Cannon also supports this Silex print server.  So you can just call Canon and get the help you need M-F 9am - 8pm EST.  No leaving a message and/or email at Silex and waiting for 3 days for Silex to get back to you.  Yeah!!!!Just as a note, you have to set up a TCP/IP port with a static IP address for the print server to talk to your router, however, that IP address is NOT in the installation paperwork.  The Silex tech support guy set my network up remotely in less than 30 minutes  and it now works with my Canon Imageclass MF4350d.  I'm just glad I was home when Silex called.First Review:Installation directions are horrible as well as their customer serviceThis company is horrible.  You call their tech support line and have to leave a message.  I also sent them an email with the product number in the subject line, and my response was, ""can you tell us what product you bought.""  That was 2 days ago. I haven't heard anything back from them yet, and now after running their software, my printer settings got screwed up and I can't print at all.  Whoever wrote those instructions must have bionic vision (5""X5"" paper manual folds out to about 2'X2') and the font is less than 8, I'm sure.  Plus the directions are just confusing.  I've set up a print server before.  It shouldn't be this difficult."
2310,"Hate the fact that I needed these, probably for a 1 or 2 time use but at least I can use a legacy drive for TimeMachine with my new Mac systems."
2311,"First of all I had low expectations because of the price. And I am still using it for headphones and speaker output on a Mac. But I thought I'd try to use it to record guitar into GarageBand. With adapters  the sound was OK. But there is a severe time lag (latency) between the playing and the hearing. So I couldn't figure out how to add another track. Since I have other ways to do that I didn't spend too much time on it, though. I have it plugged into a USB hub. The volume controls work fine on my G5 and new macbook. Pushing the up and down buttons actually changes the system beep volume. There was no ""bundled software"" to be found. You just plug it in and listen. As a replacement for a headphone jack it is fine. But in case anyone thinks they can use this particular card for garageband, I wouldn't bother."
2312,"Most of the digital TV signals are moved to the UHF spectrum. This antenna works fine in that application. In our rural Minnesota farm area, a couple stations stayed on VHF and just added the digital exciter. If any of your local stations did not change their frequency to UHF you will not be able to use this antenna for that station. Since we are so close to the Dominion du Canada there were some international issues.Hopefully in your area, all the stations have moved and are on UHF. That will make the spectrum available for Wi-Max in the very near future. I had a chance to work with it at 750Mhz and pretty awesome!The antenna is omni-directional but you need to understand that anything you have in your room will change it's non-directional nature. If the stations you need to pick up are to the right of your big flat-screen and your designer wants it on the left, guess what. The metal in your TV set will (WILL) diminish your ability to watch your game without pixelation. If you have metal siding on your home, you are living in a Faraday cage. Radio and TV frequencies only reach you through your windows. Put the antenna in the window or go with an outdoor antenna. You can buy them on Company A or there are DIY on the web.In my situation this antenna did not need the included amplifier for our local stations. At least for the UHF that it would receive. A properly position antenna should not need an amplifier in the digital world. Your world may be different, but mine is to eliminate any 24 hour loads which are not needed. Works just great without it.I got mine on the commonly available special that Company A runs for bit less than 30 dollars."
2313,"I purchased this remote from Company A a little while ago and it works fine.  I just looked at the entry this morning in preparation for writing a favorable review and see that what's pictures is different from what I bought and the price has doubled.I think what's happening is that different off-shore plants are making these and looking at any review is likely to get you feedback for something that is at least cosmetically different from what you will get.Inside, all the inexpensive corded remotes are essentially the same thing.  Two metal ""fingers"" that actuate the half-press and full press shutter functions.  They all also allow sliding the switch upwards (once it's been fully depressed) to keep the shutter open.My suggestion is to make sure the remote you order has a cord that's long enough (3 feet is good), has a low total cost (price plus shipping), and the merchant accepts returns for defective merchandise (always true for Company A, not necessarily so for Marketplace sellers).In the end, the remote I got, which was ordered from this page and a little different from the one pictured, works just fine!BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've gotten from other reviewers and continue to return the favor as best as I can.  If you thought this review was helpful please let me know by clicking on ""Yes"" button where it asks.  If there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it."
2314,It really is a good product but should have made zippers go farther to not have to take off sleeve every time of use.
2315,"Two things: one, I was disappointed that these speakers did not come with a seperate input for the subwoofer; my computer has an output jack for that and I have more faith in it managing the bass than in the speakers themselves. The speakers are slightly tinny although not bad. They sound better a little louder; the control puck is a nice, helpful addition."
2316,"I purchased a pair of these Infinity 1262W's from DiscountJungle. They appear to work fine in my old Infinity 5000 enclosures. BUT, READ the fine print before purchasing. The ad says ""Factory Sealed"" which implies an OEM product. I tried to register these speakers with Harmon-Kardon (Infinity's current owner) but could NOT - because the Serial Numbers had been removed from the cartons and were no-where in evidence on the units themselves (I did everything but pull the speakers apart to check this). I checked with DicountJungle (I specifically asked if these were grey, or black market goods - but got no answer to that question) - they said that there was a ONE year warranty on the speakers, per their ad (offered by DiscountJungle NOT Infinity); Infinity offers a THREE year warranty on their speakers. So I'm still not sure of the provenance of these units. They work fine (for now). They do NOT have an OEM warranty. Be aware of this prior to purchase. This should have been a 5 star review (for the product), but I've kicked it down a couple of notches because of doubts about the integrity of the vendor."
2317,I purchased these on sale for $30.  At $30 they are a pretty decent pair of headphones.  They lack bass and high's.  Things aren't as clear as more expensive headphones.  The cord is also very short.
2318,"My teenager ordered this microphone for gaming. The gooseneck makes the product versatile, but he has had some technical difficulty with the microphone cutting out."
2319,"It is what it is, didn't fit in my phone, but not their fault, I suppose.Simple, affordable, unshielded cabling."
2320,"Fairly easy to install....BUT would it have killed them to include 4 - 6 sheet metal screws to install the speakers with ? Another trip to the store equals -1 star.So... sound not bad, liked the sound of the polks I purchased a few years ago better but they were MORE $$. Base, midrange...For the price, not bad."
2321,"I have been using these speakers for a few weeks and I have had mixed feelings about them. One of the first things I noticed was how light they were. Some people would see this as a benefit but I think it makes them feel very cheap. Second, as other reviewers have mentioned, the RCA speaker cords are VERY short - barely long enough to make it from one side of a small desk to the other. Again, not a big deal since extensions can be found very cheap at any Radio Shack or Best Buy (or just order them on Company A when you get the speakers, you'll probably need them).Now, this will make my review different than the others, but I bought these to hook them up to my home theater PC, which means they would be the primary speakers for my living room. For some reason, they just didn't work out there. The volume was always just a little too low, or just a little hard to hear people talking in TV shows, etc... No idea why, but they just didn't work out very well.So, I kept the older Creative brand speakers with the TV which were doing the job just fine (and I believe they were about ten dollars cheaper, too) and moved the speakers into my office to hook up to the PC in there. Here, they are great. They have amazing range and clarity for the price.One other thing - the blue light on the subwoofer lights up only when there is a lot of bass in your music/movies, and it can be distracting. I thought it would work with whatever was playing out of the left and right channels but it is just a meter for the subwoofer."
2322,"Does it do its job? Yes. It holds my 55&#34; Samsung TV without a problem, but my 55&#34; also only weights like 50-60 lbs, so that's not much of an achievement for a mount.first issue I encountered, the provided bolts did NOT fit my samsung tv.  My samsung tv required M8 25mm bolts, it came with 16mm and 40mm.  So, if you're buying a new samsung tv, be advised, you'll need to pick up 25mm bolts, granted its just a few dollars, but be prepared for the extra trouble.Next, while not expecting great engineering, and knowing that when fully collapsed, it's roughly 6.5&#34; from the wall, it could have been a lot LOT closer to the wall, so that's a bit unfortunate for me.Installation wasn't super easy, as I needed someone else to help me mark holes and screw in the screws into the wall while I held the mount, which is definitely quite hefty.However, having said all this, the mount extends nicely, i havent encountered any issues with it catching or snagging, and all in all, works as described.Last note, I contacted Mount-it!, and they have terrible customer service.  They basically only sell the darn things.  No customer support from there on out.  Even though this is a &#34;SAMSUNG compatible&#34;, they didnt include the correct size screws and would not send me new ones either.  Not such a great company in my opinion."
2323,"This camera is inexpensive as far as PoE cameras go. Do not buy if you're looking for high resolution. I'm using it for monitoring a vehicle gate. The camera is about 50 yards from the gate. Something the size of a vehicle is about the minimum size for clarity. Picture is pixelated even at the highest resolution. BUTTT.. if you want something better, you're going to pay alot more and because of that fact, I recommend it."
2324,"On my MacBook this works fine right next to the computer. On my Mac mini desktop setup, though, it's about 4 feet from the computer and it goes a little spastic and unpredictable, especially with a slow Internet connection (1.5Mbps) filling out online forms. I'll use it for the MacBook but relay on my USB wireless mouse for the desktop."
2325,"Folks, it's a $14 USB floppy drive - it works... it's a bit slow (all floppy drive are!!!)  It does the job, it came w/i a week, I've used it for what I needed and I'll put it in a drawer and break it out the next time I need to pull data from a 10+ year old 3.5"" floppy disk.If you haven't used a floppy drive in a while this thing is going to seem SLOW... but they were slow 10 years ago."
2326,"loved it, loved the size and the design.i put it on my keychain for a while, but it must have gotten crushed.it stopped working.i don't think such a simple device should be fragile.other than that - nothing bad to say"
2327,they work great but they hurt my ears due to the speaker is to big. the sound quality I terrific.
2328,"I got these mainly because I wanted a pair of decent gaming headphones that had 3.5mm plugs vs USB.These are a really nice pair of headphones. But, while the mic is flexible and removable it's too flexible and does not seem to reach far enough from the left ear pad to your mouth to give good voice sound quality especially if you're doing voice recognition, flight sim voice interaction, etc. The mic also ""wobbles"" becuase it's made of a very light flexible rubber type substance. Once you do get it positioned, it tends to move and you lose voice volume/quality.Overall, these are very good quality headsets, light, comfortable and the sound quality is excellent for the price. However, you may want to consider other headphones if you do a lot of voice work using the mic.PN"
2329,This adapter works but the engineered tolerances do not make for a good fit.  When you insert an SSD drive to secure it with the provided screws the metal edges of the adapter bend in toward the drive because there is a gap between the drive and the adapter.  If you tighten the screws down all the way I am afraid that it may place too much stress on the drive and cause it damage.  I just snugged them down and left a little gap.  Its not a perfect fit but it seems to work anyway.  I just would not trust it to any kind of vibration.
2330,"Yes that is right, no wire (which I never used anyway. Always too small a gauge for my taste), no screws and NO GRILLS!What is in the box is, two speakers, two adapter rings with multiple holes for many applications, two shields to block water when mounting in some place like a door, two foam insulation rings, foam tape, warranty card and [somewhat worthless] instructions.(the instructions do show what implies what is in the box and it does show grills for this model, yet they are not included)For 30+ years of installing systems for myself, family and friends, I have been happy with the Infinity Reference Series. They are not as good as the Kappa's, but also don't cost as much. In the past, I have found that Infinity has sounded much better than comparable Pioneer. For the most part, more bass to them and less &#34;tinny&#34; sounding than Pioneer.These speakers should be $50-60, and include grills.But down to infinity for leaving out a lot of stuff normally found with a speaker purchase, especially the GRILLS!I found an inexpensive set of JL Audio grills here on Company A that fit these speakers perfectly (mounting rings and metal mess grills). If Infinity does not want to include grills, then they can have some other named grills on them. And I wont tell anyone who asks what brand speakers they are.And there is a sticker in the box which is going in the garbage."
2331,A little hard to control the volume.  Works fine once the system is set up and stabilized.  Does what it says it will
2332,"I purchased the 4250 gps model from Costco.  The car A/C plug came undone at the tip as i pull it out.  Returned and got a replacement, same issue with the plug.  The tip has a plastic round cap screw on that can easily come undone.  So with a short time of usage, as you pull out, plug in into your car's A/C, the head piece gets loose and fall apart.  Now, i find myself buying a replacement plug, of the same model, and expect the same fate.  Please make the fix, Magellan."
2333,"Got this as an upgrade to my laptop, thought that it would fit the series I had. When I got it I found the pins were on the wrong side and the mounting studs were wrong. Apparently when it says G70 series it means just that and does not include the G72... mea culpa, should have double checked. The company was very courteous about returning the product."
2334,"As stated this item does what it is intended to do. I would like it if the tension could be bit higher and I wish it cut the cable tie a little closer with less sharp edges, but hey, what can you expect for an items this inexpensive?"
2335,"The radio part of this unit leaves a lot to be dicier, the stations have static that comes and goes no matter how you possition the antenna or place the radio. But the the other features are OK"
2336,"Works ok. Battery life was not as long as my original, but it does the job. Also, I started having problems with my mouse pad after replacing the battery and after googling the issue, I discovered the battery was the cause. It is a little puffier than the original battery and affected the mouse on my laptop. When I take the battery out, the mouse works fine."
2337,"I should say that I've never owned a GPS unit before.  I was waiting until the price dropped to the point where you could get a decent one with traffic info, bluetooth, and text to speech for less than [...] bucks.  This was it.  I see it's slightly more expensive now.The setup on this thing is fairly straightforward, but here are a few issues that I had.  First, I tried to set this up outside and not in my car.  Don't do that.  You need the keycode for MSN Direct to set up traffic and while there is a key code on the charger cable, you need to make sure it's the same as the one on the actual unit.  The only way you can access MSN Direct and find the key code is to have the unit plugged in via your car cigarette lighter because the car charging cable is where the receiver for MSN Direct is located.  No cable means no MSN Direct.Second, there is no full manual for this model.  It's not in the box.  You have to download it, but Garmin doesn't show the manual for this model on its website.  Instead download the 265WT manual, which seems to be the generic manual for the 205 Series.Third, it's easy to screw up on the initial set up and load a default for Spain instead of the US.  If you hit the arrow button instead of press directly on the words ""United States of America,"" this will happen.  At least that's what happened to me.  To reset the defaults, turn off the machine, then press a finger on the lower right hand corner of the screen and hold while you turn it back on.As others have noted, MSN Direct costs 49 dollars per year (beyond the initial free 9 mos) and will disappear in January 2012.  That's why this unit is being sold at such a high discount.  I don't know how valuable MSN Direct will be over time, but by January 2012 there will undoubtedly be better and cheaper GPS units available so for me this is a non-issue.  Supposedly there is a Garmin traffic receiver built into this unit in addition to the MSN Direct receiver, but I can't find any way of confirming that.As for the unit, the text to speech is fine, the screen is crisp, and the bluetooth works well with my cell phone.  It can take anywhere from several seconds to about 15 seconds for the unit to come up with a route for local runs.  It mounts easily.  It appears to be well designed.  So far I've had one glitch in a heavily treed area where the unit thought it was in Evanston, IL (I'm in California).  Aside from that it has been very accurate.  But the unit should have come with a full manual in the box.  To not include one is truly being too cheap."
2338,"The mouse clicks faster than my desktop Logitech M510, scrolls nicely, and tracks on all the surfaces I use. It's too small for my hand, but then it's for a laptop.It stopped working after 9 months. I've used mice since 1991, and none ever died. Of course in the early days mice were wired and had balls; you know, the small European balls or the big American balls. No reason any mouse shouldn't last forever."
2339,"When we tried it on our 05 Prius it had horrible reception. It sounded muffled and the static was really bad. We messed around with it, turning the dials, taking it out and putting it back and out of no ware it got MUCH better. There is still a background noise, but it's definitely tolerable. Hope it last but I don't have much hope."
2340,"I've had this little NetBook for a few years now.  My boss recommended it to me.  Six days after warranty, the ""e"" key stopped working; or rather, it worked too well.  It filled the buffer.  I called ASUS, and the guy was just a level 1 jerk.  So, I was able to get a replacement keyboard from Korea (on eBay) for a reasonable price, and I installed it myself.  The install wasn't too bad once I realized there was a little bit of stickum under the upper right corner of the keyboard.  It makes me nervous to pry thing out--makes me think I missed a screw or something.Fast forward a month.  My boss tells me that his ""n"" key did the same thing!  I actually installed his keyboard for him.Fast forward about a year.  The CMOS battery dies.  What the heck?  I haven't had a CMOS battery die in a computer for twenty-five years!  So, I bought one for $8 shipped (off eBay), had it shipped, and installed it.  The install wasn't too bad, but there are a lot of screws in this thing, and it required a bit of contorting.  Anyway, it wasn't a huge deal.  Oh!  The best part!  I had to break a sticker seal that said ""warranty void if broken"" to get to one of the screws.  Ha!Twenty minutes after the install of the CMOS battery, I mentioned this to my boss.  Would you believe it?!  HIS CMOS battery died, too!OK, Asus . . . you guys FAIL with this unit.  I won't blather on and on about the customer support, nor do I think all their products are lame.  I have a Republic of Gamers that smokes!  I had a dual port video card that screams!  But with respect to the Eee PC, ASUS came up short.But I am still going to give this unit 3 stars.  The battery life is anywhere up to 6 hours.  Plugged into a cigarette lighter, we were entertained throughout a three day hurricane deluge in Mexico.  If the idea of replacing a keyboard or a CMOS battery doesn't faze you, then this isn't a bad little unit.  It's a full-blown PC that runs applications, maybe not as fast as an ROG, but even so.  Nowadays everyone is going Kindle Fire and iPad and such, and depending upon your needs, those might be a better option for you.  As for me, I like the fact that the keyboard on the Eee PC (when it works) is actually usable as a keyboard.  It's also small enough to carry to the library, to a park, to work, whatever."
2341,"Nice graphics on a soft sleeve. The only downside, it has strap d-rings implying you can use it with a shoulder strap but doesn't come with the strap."
2342,"I bought this somewhere else but thought I would let Company A users know what I ran across.I got this to round out my sound in the living room and replace the TV speakers, which we all know are not great and it does have pretty good sound.BUT, the problem is that I can't find a remote to work all of my items, TV, Cable and sound bar. I called Time Warner, the Vizio people and anywhere else I could find but the only codes anyone could give me are four and five digit codes, all of my remotes only take a three digit code. I have three TW remotes and another I bought and all of them just take the three digit codes. This is why I gave it only 3 stars.So if you are buying this and hope to use one universal remote, good luck.UPDATE: I found a remote that works with this sound bar and all other things I own. Maybe this will help all of those with the problems of their factory remotes.Logitech Harmony 300 Remote Control 915-000143"
2343,"The Klipsch Image S2 are decent headphones. The main selling point to these compared to other earbuds is comfort. The extended nozzle makes them very easy to put in your ear and get a tight seal. Much better and easier than the other IEMs where you have to go around the back of your head, pull your ear up then stick the headphones in. Less fumbling around. During use the headphones are extremely comfortable, I would even say the best Ive used and causes no ear fatigue. Sadly the sound quality is the let down. Bass is decent but loose, doesnt have the punch and slam I am used to. With every recording Ive listened to, whether it be flac or CDs the treble has a hollow sound to it and too bright. If you are looking for accurate sound these are not it. But I guess they can pass for causal everyday use. I will give them an extra star for comfort however even my $18 sony headphones have better sound than these."
2344,This is weird because you can place a flash drive but it can't power an external hdd which means it is an old school usb hub which I have no problem because of respect but that is just strange.
2345,"a friend told me that this supports his camera with a large zoom attached....it did not support my nikon d60 with a 70-300mm zoom, I'm disappointed.  Considering sending it back, we'll see..."
2346,"Overall this system is not terrible, but for me the bass is disappointing. Even with EQ I could not get the low end to sound convincing [realistic] enough...yes I know the sub speaker is tiny and I don't expect it to play down to 30Hz (wont even try to call this a woofer), but sheesh. Also I get port noise, which is very annoying. At the moment its up on my PC desk close to me so maybe it wouldn't be that bad tucked away somewhere else.Cant say Ive listened to anything else in this price range but if you're looking to entertain or just get loud, this is not it.A plus, I bought this so I could connect my Dishnetwork with RCA audio since my monitor's built in speakers are worse. :)"
2347,"I'd get these again, but realize they aren't going to impress you with their dynamic range.  If you just want to play games/watch movies, then they're acceptable for the price.  Don't even come close to a decent set of in-ear buds, like a cheaper Shure or Westone UM-1, by comparison."
2348,"This one works with my new AT&T; ML17929 phone. The headset is easy to put on (good for when the phone is ringing), and I like having the sound in both ears. It has plugs for 2.5mm, 3.5mm, plus another pair of 3.5mm plugs to hook up to a computer's sound jacks.The foam earphone covers are comfortable.The cord has a volume control, which is nice. It also has a little button on it, though I haven't figured out what that's for, other than just to make a clicking sound that's audible on the line. No mention of that button on the box. It might be a non-functioning mute button.The one bad thing: Quiet sound output. If the person I'm talking on the phone with has any background noise, then he/she can't hear me well enough to make out what I'm saying."
2349,"This came with zero instructions, and it's easy to put the card in the wrong way.  It's also difficult to take the card out.  If you look at the product picture, you'll see a stamped triangle.  That hard to see thing should match the little white triangle on the card.  Insert until it can't go further.Once in, you may need to use a pin or ball point pen to push it out."
2350,"I have a couple universal AC USB chargers and universal USB 12V cigarette lighter chargers, along with a few dedicated AC and 12V cigarette lighter mini-USB chargers.  Rather than buy new micro-USB cables for my Evo 3D, I thought the adapters will allow me to re-purpose the mini-USB chargers and cables.  Wrong.  The adapters work with some of the cables and chargers but not others.  It's a hit or miss on functionality, not to mention the length of the charging cable plug end is now almost 2.5"" long, nearly 1.5"" for the actual adapter plus the existing mini-USB charger.  The added length of the adapter and the existing micro-USB cable end adds quite a bit of stress on the micro-USB port of the phone.  IMO, the best option is to buy universal AC and 12v cigarette lighter USB chargers and replace the cables as needed than mess with the adapters.Shipping for each adapter costs almost just as much as the adapter itself, running about $1.10 each after shipping."
2351,"I bought this to go with a Kata 3N1-10 Sling BackpackKata KT D-3N1-10 Sling/Backpack (Black). I'm returning the backpack, you can read my review there.Kata advertises this to carry a small tripod. I have a Gitzo GT1541-T tripod, the strap on this is too small to go around the tripod head where the legs join. If I invert the tripod so the straps can go around the feet, the head won't fit in the pouch. Either the strap or pouch needs to be a little larger if you're using this particular tripod. If you have a smaller tripod this may be a solution if you like the Kata bag.The way the holder attaches to the backpack could be improved. You have to thread the lower straps through a buckle that's already being used. Not impossible, but more difficult than it should be. It appears this holder was designed after the bag was, and the bag's design wasn't updated to accommodate this holder.I'm returning this for a refund."
2352,"For the price it's hard to complain too much.  The tie clip broke quite easily, the mic has lots of noise, there's no LED battery indicator, and the mic can be rather noisy at times depending on how it's attached to your subject and what it's plugged into.  Having a longer cord can be nice at times, but most of the time it just gets in the way."
2353,"As received, the low-light video quality was relatively poor.  After updating the camera software it improved.  The camera is quite easy to use and well designed in most ways.  However, it is a fixed-focus camera.  Therefore, even though it has good depth of field, many of the things you video will be either too close or too far away to be in good focus.  Therefore, the benefits of HD are lost a lot of the time.  Actually, the focus is switchable between normal (mountains symbol) and macro (flower symbol), but the macro position focuses too close up to be useful for filming people.  Autofocus would make this a much better camera.Sony makes a similar pocket-size camcorder that includes autofocus.  (I saw it demonstrated in a store.)  I recommend that you check it out before buying this camera."
2354,My previous pair of Audio Technica headphones were stolen.  They now make this model which aren't as good.  The material on the ear isn't as soft and comfortable and the noise reduction quality doesn't seem as good (even though it's suppose to better).  I never understand why some companies have to go and mess with a perfectly good product.
2355,"I agree totally with other reviewers, my now broken Logitech 203's were awesome. Gone forever though, as all good things. I tried these 313's at Best Buy... they sounded better than the larger Insignia model NS-PCS41's which were boomy, and had no mid range at all... stay away from those. I have a large stereo now in the man cave, so don't need killer sounds from the computer. These 313's work fine, not the best, but for $39, I don't think they can be beat. I just sent back the Cyber Acoustics 3602's... didn't last 3 weeks before they developed an intermittent loud hum/buzz that was horrible. Didn't sound nearly as good as people rate them either.... very boxy/boomy. One reviewer after calling himself an audiophile, said the 3602's blew him away. I won't even comment on that bit of ridiculousness...  If you're looking for decent sound in a non complicated, inexpensive package, the 313's are the best pick. When coupled with a decent track with some bass, they actually sound great.... pick a track with no bass, and they sound weak. Oh well, nothing's perfect..."
2356,"After receiving the product and the amount I paid for it, it really wasn't worth purchasing the protection plan. A waste of money even if it does offer good coverage."
2357,I finally got it figured out I think. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it doesn't let me know what the speed limit is within the area I am driving like my old one did.
2358,Doesn't charge as well or as quickly as my Kindle plug but it will do in a pinch. Works with any USB on computer
2359,"You get what you pay for, it's cheap, distorted, foolishly rated in peak watts that really means nothing, but it's small and fits anywhere, even in my old Goldwing GL1200.  It plays music, good enough.  Speakers are worthless junk.  Plays a bit louder than an iphone speaker."
2360,"I expected to get a downgrade of the newer digital cameras, but i didnt expect what i recieved. This is an ok camera for a child, but for an adult or teenager who is constantly taking pictures this is not the camera for you. The camera takes okay pictures, but the screen to view the pictures (lcd) is very small. I can compare this camera to a flip phone camera, not exactly what comes to mind when you think ""digital camera"". The batteries die super fast!"
2361,Work well but only but only on TVs with  an &#34;audio out&#34; plug.
2362,"I've had my eye on an external hard drive for back up purposes for a while and when I got the opportunity to grab the Western Digital My Book Essential 1TB USB drive, I jumped at it. With a few exceptions, it hits the mark for my purposes.The drive itself is in an attractive upright storage case with a light indicator (a very BRIGHT one) giving you an indication of how much space you have used on the drive. The case also includes cooling vents (no fan), cable lock port, power and activity lights.Hooking it up is a breeze, just plug it into a USB port on your computer and then into a power outlet. The WDSmartWare software installs easily, setting itself up as a virtual CD drive (which could become a problem if you use more than one My Book), and is intuitive and easy to use, but basic. You can schedule backups, retrieve backed up files and see the status of your drive in your taskbar.And, the My Book drive works nicely as a mapped network drive for me.I did run into a couple of issues that are related to my particular PC setup. I first tried hooking the My Book to my Windows XP media center PC in my media room. Worked flawlessly until a reboot at which time the PC hung before loading Windows. I looked for a bypass for the USB drive in the system bios boot settings, but there wasn't one, so, since I sometimes have to reboot this PC remotely (it's primarily used for Orb cable TV and media streaming), this wouldn't work for me.I moved it to my Windows 7 desktop, but the WDSmartWare software apparently has issues with my legacy Tritton USB VGA adapter. When I have my second monitor working through the adapter, the WDSmartWare software opens, then disappears from view. I have to disable the adapter to see the drive software on the primary monitor.Not a deal killer, though, since I basically set the WDSmartWare software and forget it for the most part. I personally plan to use the My Book Essential as a network drive anyway. But, keep in mind, this software is installed whether you want it or not, fine for a beginner with basic backup needs, but advanced users won't like it at all.And, the manufacturer states ""compatibility may vary depending on user's hardware configuration and operating system.""All in all, the My Book Essential External Hard Drive is a nice, basic external storage option. The version I received is Windows XP, Vista and 7 ready. It requires reformatting for Mac."
2363,My system picked up this enclosure immediately after it was plucked it. It was stable throughout the few hours use without getting overheating issues.
2364,"This only seemed to work when the remote was within 2 feet or so of the receiver. After that the reception became very spotty at best. I tried moving it in multiple locations on and around my TV with no luck.The guys at Infrared Resources were super helpful and recommended other products that would suit my needs. They promptly gave me a full refund with no questions asked. Even though the product didn't work for me, their customer service was enough to earn 3 stars."
2365,"I'm a professional photographer and needed a lens hood for my 85 pretty quickly. I purchased this, hoping to save some money.It's cheap plastic. It's alright for the money, it hasn't broken yet, but the tabs that hold the hood onto the lens are flimsy and feel like they're going to snap in a dozen pieces every time I put it on.I prefer a lens hood that screws on, like Canon's ES-71II for the 50 1.4.I'll still use this lens hood until it breaks. Again, it's alright for the amount of money I paid."
2366,This is a nice idea but needs some engineering.  Attaching to plug to the end for storage is a bit of a hassle.  The 3 outlets and 2 USB ports are handy for travel.  Small enough to pack.
2367,"Bought another WD Live WiFi 1080P to replace a dead ASUS O'Play in 2013 and have it paired with a WD NAS wired connection to router. Set up is plug and play after software update and logging to the network. The player works fine and has an interface that feels more like windows. I use it primarily as a digital music player and limited video streaming. WD needs to add more apps and an rf remote instead of the ir. Its a bit temperamental on pointing the remote directly at the box. It also tends to respond slowly to inputs and connecting to the NAS. Overall if you are going to access files on your network storage its fine. However if you are a heavier app user a Roku is the way to go - which is what I use for streaming video and music. Having used all three the Roku edges it out with faster connects and better remote.2010 review : I  have now purchased this unit twice and returned it both times. The first time I could not get wired network connectivity, the second time I could use all the wired network functions, but could never connect to the internet to use the apps. Very disappointing! It works fine for slide shows on an HDTV and feeding music to my sound system through my wired network. I gave up and bought an ASUS O'Play."
2368,"This is the right length cable for tethering shoot, however it keeps falling off the camera during the shoot which is deal breaker for me. I might look for something better."
2369,"NO THRILLS AND CHILLS HERE, THEY ARE A SET OF CABLES, WHAT CAN I SAY? THEY WORK FINE, BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT!"
2370,This is a pro item for fine tuning your lenses BUT you need to go on line and find the documentation.  the documentation should be included either written or on a CD
2371,"I received my Squeezebox and have been overall satisfied.  I'm just noting here that while doing a little research on the Squeezebox that I read that Logitech is discontinuing this specific ""system"".  It looks like they will continue sell the same basic piece of hardware, but the software/online system will change.  It seemed to me that if you just want to get internet radio, you will be fine, but if you want to use some of the more advanced features (i.e. streaming music from your computer, etc.) you might have some limitations/changes.Just an FYI to do a little research before you buy."
2372,I just received my keyboard and my first impression before even using it is............the advertising is misleading. The dimensions state that it is 18in and it is not. Yall need to fix the write up on the product since I chose this one because it was listed as bigger than all the others.
2373,"I bought one WAP3205 to connect a web-enabled datalogger to a wireless network.  It worked fine, and has been operating flawlessly.Then I bought two of these devices to connect a hard wired network in one building to a device in a nearby building (with one WAP3205 in ""access point mode"" and the other in ""client mode"".  This worked fine initially, but that only lasted for a day and a half, after which point the connection went dead.  It seems to come back to life when I unplug them then plug them back in, but it will only operate for a little while before going dead again.I have tried repositioning the devices to get a stronger signal between the two transmitters, but that doesn't seem to be helping.  Perhaps one of the WAP3205s is faulty.  I don't know, but it sure has been a hassle trying to get it to work.  This is a bit of an unusual installation, so most folks probably wouldn't run into this problem."
2374,The 6th generation Nano doesn't have video playback nor recording. Also it's almost so small it's too small. I'd rather have had the larger size and double the capacity. I'm recommending to the ones I buy these for to get the 5th generation and if I was buying one personally I'd get the 5th generation. Otherwise it's ok. A few of the navigation ways was difficult for me to figure out (and usually I don't take long to figure things out in general like this). Decent but not great. Size and weight are about the only wow factors. Touch screen is nice but not critical and is again a wow thing.
2375,"I like these headphones for a few reasons.  1) They have decent sound, especially for the price.  2) The controller is fantastic and can play/pause, answer/hang up, has volume control, and can skip forward/backward.  3) The fit fairly well in to my ears.I dislike these headphones for a few reasons: 1)  The microphone is too low and clothing can really interfere with speech.  2) They can become incredibly entangled even with the cord management.  3)  The cord management is a nice start, but could be wider to accommodate more cord and can be incredibly annoying at times and can make the tangling even worse, especially if you need a longer cord if you keep your phone/mp3 player in your back pocket."
2376,"This is a compact unit and even if you get a 4 GB unit you can get a micro card inexpensively but there are many flawed units, in general.... no particular seller's fault."
2377,"This isn't for the Clip+, but rather for discontinued Clip with which I am intimately familiar in all aspects.. usage, firmware, support, durability, usability.  I am reviewing here given that these issues could also occur with the Clip+.  I love the Clip's portability and sound first and foremost.  It's best for music, a bit more cumbersome for audiobooks and podcasts, as are the three Fuzes that I own.  I've had four of them and up to two at a tme.  I bought my first Clip in late 2007 after it was first introduced.I take good care of my stuff, but have had all four Clips malfunction in a similar way, typically within 12-18 months of purchase.- First two, the volume control quit working; I could no longer adjust the volume.  Sandisk RMA'ed one of them as it was within 1-year warranty, and gave me a brand new one which represents either #3 or #4 here.- Third, the home button quit working; I could no longer navigate from where I left off.- Fourth, the home button is also on its way to no longer working.  I was able to reset my Clip per instructions, but the home button does not always respond when I press it, even after resetting.  I've had Sandisk Support involved in the previous three cases and frankly I'm tired of it.  They've been easy to work with via email when in warranty, but I'm deciding not to bother this time.Comparing the Fuze and Clip+, I am highly hesitant to buy a Clip+ as my Clips have been essentially been 15-month rentals for me.  Either there is something wrong with the way I'm handling them, or they are simply not built to last a very long time.  I typically carry them in my pants pocket when on the go, to prevent dropping on the ground.Neither the Fuze or Clip have been nearly as seamless on podcasts as my Creative Zen Vision:M - perhaps there is some software that can facilitate more seamless synchronization and less fiddling with ID3 tags to get podcasts filed where I want them.Nevertheless the Clip is incredibly useful at the gym.  If I were purchasing a Clip+, I would likely expect it to fail just as my Clips did, and at the time of writing this review, some Clip+ models are approaching the 15-month mark in age and usage.  So it will be interesting to hear more about its durability, and I encourage comments to this review from owners with respect to that.  But I am going to explore my options before coming back to the Clip+."
2378,"Cools my HP dv7 about 6-8+ degrees Celsius.You should extend the back legs of the cooler to get the best cooling effect because there's more room under the fan.Wish those legs felt more sturdy. I hope they don't break. Honestly that leg height should be default height because it gives the most cooling effect.During gaming my highest temp is still up to 82 degree Celsius, still wish it was lower, but that's probably not the coolers fault but more HP's fault. HP sucks with laptop cooling.I suggest getting a bigger cooler if you have a 17"" laptop. This works but I would think something with more coverage would work even better. I would try the Cooler Master Notepal U3 from the same company.Excellent product.Edit: it slid off the desk and one of the little legs broke off like i feared would happen damit, its just too damn slippery on the legs and thats the only height it cools well, ATTENTION COOLER MASTER: make legs sturdier and/or slip-resistant next time"
2379,"Good made, but loose-fitting plug adapter. Prefer other ones. Not happy by this, but it is OK in some situations. Not Polarized!"
2380,"I've had this number pad for about six months.  I purchased it because I do a lot of financial statement analysis and related work on a laptop.  I did not want to have to carry around a USB transceiver and this device fit the bill perfectly.The problem with this device is its auto-off time.  The device shuts itself off to save the battery and when you start using it, it takes ~5 seconds for it to reconnect.  In other words, if you use the number pad every few minutes it has to reconnect, ignoring SOME of the inputted characters, spitting out a partial string of what you were typing forcing you to stop and double check what you typed.  The net effect is that it slows you down.  When you're transcribing a bunch of numbers, this can be maddening.The keys are great - they are similar to a laptop and are beveled slightly so you can find the center of a key without looking.  The device is thin and comes with a carrying pouch with is perfect for a laptop bag.  Once it is connected, there is no lag or delay and it acts exactly like a wired keyboard.Overall - I really wanted to like this device but the constant need to reconnect drives me crazy.  Unless I am going to be using it heavily, I don't bother to bring it with my anymore.  I hate the number keys above the main keyboard but using them is faster than letting this device wake up and reconnect."
2381,"I needed to reboot my network and my computers to be able to see this RAID.  I set it up with the installed drive, and after rebooting everything it showed up on my desktop.  Data transfer speeds were as expected over a 1Gb network at about 20-30 MB/sec for a large movie file, but the transfers seemed to slowed down over time.  I have seen this before on other devices.  I left the device on for a few days, and it was accessible.  I tried to access the drive from mobile phone, but received the message that I need to buy a service to do this.  This was a shock.  I noted that the company offers to set up network available services for photographs etc, like many other providers, but you have to pay for this type of access using the drive I bought from them.  After a few days the drive blue power light started flashing and it stopped showing up on my network.  No amount of rebooting brought it back.  The two issues of having to buy a service to fully use my drive, and the sudden loss of the drive off my network caused me to return the drive to the retailer.  I bought a much more expensive Drobo FS system from data robotics and this fits my needs much better."
2382,"I bought this to replace a Logitech Marble Mouse trackball. The Logitech device was interfering with tabs in Safari (Mac). (Note: the newest software update from Logitech fixes that problem.) The best thing about the Kensington trackball is that no extra software is required. Plug and use. I have really enjoyed the scroll ring, so even though I have updated the Logitech software, I'm still using this trackball. The downside: it's less ergonomic than the Marble Mouse. My wrist gets more tired/sore. The included wrist rest is, for me, practically useless. Better if Kensington had simply lengthened and narrowed the trackball more in the first place. But, as I said, I have not gone back to the Marble Mouse because of the scroll ring. If I were to be on the computer for a long period of time, however, I think I would switch -- for that task -- to the Marble Mouse...then return to this.Edit: 7-18-13I purchased the Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse 64327in March, 2012, and have been using it ever since, happily. I have a Mac and use the trackpad with my left hand in lieu of a scroll ring (the optical mouse does not have the latter). I really like this trackball and prefer it to either the old Kensington or the Logitech. I tossed the scroll ring model when the clickers failed. I still have the Marble Mouse but it's sitting on a shelf gathering dust. So after 16 months, the optical trackball is going strong, seems better built than this model, and works well with the Apple track pad, for me, anyway."
2383,"I was looking for a wireless mouse, that will not need an extra adapter, as other wireless mouses need, so I decided to buy this bluetooth mouse. While overal performance is OK, there are some cons that you should consider, before buying such mouse:1. Bad ergonomics. The ""raiser"" function actually raises only back side of the mouse, not whole body, so not much difference due to height change. Also, back side of mouse has sharp angle, so when you rise it, it actually feels WORSE in the hand, then when lowered.2. More bad ergonomics. Scroll wheel looks cute'n'sexy but it's very narrow and uncomfortable.3. Even more bad ergonomics. While ""click"" sound is low, tactile feedback is also very low, you can hardly understand, whenever you pressed a button or not.4. Package? While mine arrived in factory sealed package, the mouse itself has few dents and scratches - ones that may appear during the general usage. I wonder, why new mouse should look like that? Verbatim is selling refurb?"
2384,"The device works as claimed but has a few problems.  The molex connector from the power supply will not make good connection but I used a old power supply to power up the hard drive I needed data from.  The other parts work just fine and considering the price I really don't have a lot to complain about.  I would caution, however, to not trust the power supply that came with this kit.  Also there are no instructions with the device."
2385,"I transfered 150 GB of information from a Vista computer to a new Windows 7. Started at noon and as the transfer started, it said 3 hours to complete. 3 hours later it was saying 4 hours to complete. Well 8 hours after starting the transfer, it was finally done. Not very fast! I made sure my antivirus was turned as with many of my other programs on both computers. If you are transfering a large amount of data, start early in the day.It has been a couple weeks since the transfer. I am finding files that were corrupted during the transfer, pdf files and image files. Hold onto your old computer just in case you need to copy some files."
2386,"This is a great price. I bought my nano used and it didn't come with a charger, so this was a good price for just something that will charge it. But it's frustrating that I can't listen to it while charging it. Also when syncing to itunes, I often get an error, which is 99% likely due to the cord. Still a good price and it does charge."
2387,"Pros: Ease of installation and activation is a snap.  Sound quality is very good (with caveat in the cons). Very easy to use; menu and programming is very intuitive.  Hard to beat the price.Cons: On the third day after installing, the audio wire/plug going into my 'aux' input of my car radio started hissing and lost the right channel.  The wire is really, REALLY, cheaply made.  I worry about the antenna wire, because it appears to be no better in quality.  The gauging of both wires is MAYBE 14-16 gauge.  Great for hiding under trim, not so great in terms of robustness.  Also worrisome is the fact that sometimes the radio doesn't always go into menu mode when pressing the menu button.  It seems to be hit-or-miss, and you have to press it several times to finally get the thing into menu mode.  Very worrisome if you ever have to change a FM frequency setting, etc.....which IS likely, because.......if 97.9 (the default frequency transmission) is too close to a strongish commercial radio station in your area, you will need to change it.  Any FM frequency close to a fairly strong commercial radio station will suffer from static/interference.  In the interest of fairness, once you find a relatively 'lonely' FM frequency in your area, the sound quality of the FM transmission is stellar.  I'm hoping the purchase of a decent mini-plug stereo cable will fix up the aux feed problem but, frankly, that extra purchase shouldn't be necessary for a brand new radio with a (supposedly) complete car installation 'kit'.Overall, I can't fault the concept, but the execution seems to be really marginal.  Buyer beware.  This could be $50 thrown away if the thing dies within a few months.  Which, I suspect, may be more likely than one would hope."
2388,"SO I got this and right out of the package it looks used. Chips off the bottom part where the USB plug is, and a chip in the plastic over the light..also some pen on the bottom USB...THEN it wouldn't work, and would for some reason shut off my wireless mouse when it was plugged into the port next to it.......i guess it diverted all the power to itself or something...even though it wouldn't work.Finally I twisted off the cap and put it back on, and now it works.....So 3/5 stars because 1. I had to fix it, 2 it shut off my mouse!..and 3 I'm pretty sure its used..........You take a risk buying this.Thanks"
2389,This is a small pocket style hand held video camera and as such suffers from shaky cam syndrome. It is not a design flaw but just the nature of the beast when it comes to small hand held cameras. If you are recording while holding this thing in your hand and moving at all you will get videos that shake horribly. This may or may not bother you. I would recommend using this camera from a fixed/stable position whenever possible to minimize the shakiness. Hopefully future versions will incorporate some sort of image stabilization because I find not having this as being this camera's most fatal flaw.Pros:- Feels solid- Good overall video quality across a wide range of conditions- They fixed the USB connector size problem- Simple software built into the deviceCons:- No image stabilization- No user replaceable battery- No memory card slots to add more capacity- No USB extension cable included- No HDMI cable included- No lens protection (I don't think the included soft case is enough)If you want an OK pocket cam to tote around in places where you wouldn't want to take your full featured video camera this should suffice. I think other companies are headed in the right direction with these pocket cams from what I have seen coming out. Hopefully flip can compete and come out with some models that have image stabilization and more user friendly hardware features.
2390,"In summary, this thing does what it advertises. It does control all of my AV components, and the ""Activities"" make it very easy to use.The good:Easy set up.I had replaced an earlier Harmony remote, and it carried most of the settings over to the new one. Some tweaking was required. People unfamiliar or uncomfortable with setting up tech devices may have issues. This isn't ""plug and play"", though it's certainly not difficult.Rechargeable.This is probably my favorite feature. Our old remote was going through batteries about every month to month and a half. When your whole entertainment center depends on one remote, having it go out kind of grinds things to a halt. Not an issue with this one.Ease of use.It's really nice to be able to select an activity and have the remote do the rest. No problem with friends or family members being lost trying to turn the TV on.The bad:ErgonomicsI have average male sized hands and this thing is just awkward to use. The number pad is at one end while the touch screen is at the other. someone with 10"" thumbs might not have a problem, but those of us with normal appendages end up having to use 2 hands, and even then it's awkward.Touch screen too sensitiveThis is partly due to the poor ergonomics, but it's far too easy to tap the wrong selection on the screen.Price.As stated by others, the price is a little steep for what you get. Granted, you're probably not going to find another remote with all the functionality for cheaper, but paying this much for a utilitarian device stung a little.Knowing what I now know, I might have sprung for the more expensive one that's square and entirely touch screen based. Not that this one isn't great, it's just slightly awkward to use."
2391,"I want to be a fan of Sonos, but having to use an extra app instead of Airplay (yes I know you can hook it up to an Airport Extreme) makes it a pain to use.  Also tweaking my iTunes library to sync to me network to be available is a bit of a pain, although it is nice I can simply hit ""Play"" on the Sonos and it plays right from my library on my network.  No DTS support also makes me reluctant to use this or other Sonos products in the future.  Though, this unit is okay, and I got a good deal, I would probably not purchase it again.  I would probably grab an Airplay supported speaker.Thank you to all the people who didn't find my review helpful.  I'm guessing you all hate airplay."
2392,"I liked the fact that it was light and sturdy, and that it raised the back of my pc at a tilt for easier typing. At first I waspleased at how quiet it was, however after a few months the fans became intermitantly noisey. Nothing I do can stop the noisethey make. The price is nice, and it works well. It reduced my temps. by about 5 degrees but with the noise the fans sometimesmake it's almost a deal breaker. The noise started after about 4 months and isn't constant but it is annoying when it occurs."
2393,I bought two of these. One works well and holds a charge for weeks. The other will discharge if left over time so I think its not working right. Decent but not great quality replacement battery for your ipod mini.
2394,"Update:I used lousy WD green drives in it. 2 died at once, which is unrecoverable.I left it sitting closed for awhile, now it doesn't work right.Not sure if it went bad or if it might have played a role in the drives going bad so quickly.I know the WD drives are extremely unreliable even in a normal computer, so I'm giving this the benefit of the doubt here.Previous Review:I'll go back and change this to a 5 later if I don't run into any problems it in the next week or two.I just received this, but so far I'm really impressed with it.I have a raid box from another company too, and like the other problems I've ordered from that other company in the past I'm having problems with it. So I bought this while waiting on an RMA.I really like this so far.PROs:Very compact, it's not much larger than the 4 drives stacked on each other.It's very solidly built too.It worked right out of the box as well.Very quiet.It has a comprehensive set of connections as well, esata, usb 2.0, firewire 400 and 800CONs: none reallyThings I would change if I could, but aren't really problems:Like another review said, the front comes off easily, but since it's really just a cover, and doesn't hold the drives in, it is not a problem, and only a little annoying when you need to move it. The drives are held in place but another piece that is under the cover visible in the picture, which is why having it come off doesn't cause any problems.I would change the drive handles so that they didn't require screws. Basically I'd probably just have pegs on the handles and have the user bend the handle a little to hook them to the drive. Once on, the sides of the array would help hold the handle in placeSome sort of more advanced management software would be nice. I put in drives from the other array and it actually recognized that they were used for a RAID 5 array, and let me access the data that was on them originally. But since 1 drive is different it's attempting to rebuild the array right now, when I'd rather have it just re-initialize the drives from scratch."
2395,lots of backgrounds an photoshop filesDon't know if its good but definitely a great way to start and get ideas. some are really cheesy but others are good. Looking forward to making great card and frames for friend and family!
2396,this is a good buy for the sound. the only problem was one of the ears went out less than two months.
2397,"I bought this bag because I was expecting Swissgear from Switzerland, not China! I don't mind paying double or triple for it if it'll last me a lifetime. But this thing looks sub-par.The zippers are ugly and cheap-looking. The stitching along the side of the zippers is all zig-zaggy, like the tailor was doing it while drinking his beer. The material looks cheap.I've only had it for a week and I like it overall but I expected more from Swissgear, not a me-too from China. Anyway, it looks sturdy but we'll see about that."
2398,"Works, sometimes fast and sometimes not at all. Randomly disconnects, the 300MBPS is a pain to make it connect to right. Regardless of what the rate is, its prone to random disconnects that force me to either disable or unplug it, or restart my computer. Terrible for gaming online, where I am hosting and 10 people are relying on my internet to be stable, or when I am watching Netflix.With some adjustments and using it at less than optimal rate (like 72MBPS or 150MBPS) it works better, but the disconnect issue is still there. Also, while it will work out of the box with linux, that is just with the standard wireless adapter drivers present in (at least) Ubuntu. There is no native linux driver, so it runs poorly.I have a generic version of the TL-wN721N that is featured on the description page (its by realtek, apparently TP-LINK and them are the same company?) and it runs perfectly in both windows and Linux, very reliable. I was hoping to buy something faster than it, but I'm going to stick with the $8, supposedly lower end one I bought before."
2399,"These are excellent quality headphones with an amazingly faithful sound. They are a joy to use. The big issue I have keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that it is a royal pain to get them to recognize their transmitter each time you turn them on to use them. I constantly get frustrated holding them next to the transmitter and holding the &#34;on&#34; button until, after many attempts, they finally lock on. My several previous pairs of headsets were not Sennheisers and were not of this quality, but the moment you lifted them off of their cradle and put them on, they worked. There was no switch on the headsets that you had to fool with to get them to work. It is a shame that these beautiful headsets are tarnished by being frustrating to turn on and use. Plus the power switch on the headset is poorly placed so that it is not possible to turn them on and off while on your head. Once married with the transmitter, they are great."
2400,"I liked the look of this when I first looked at it - a little shiny, the black ornamental swirls were a little more matte, the strap seemed sturdy, as did the stitching. My small 13"" MacBook fit in perfectly, a little snug which is how I prefer it to fit.Then, after looking at it with my laptop inside I realized the zipper wasn't sewn in straight. it kind of looked ""wavy"" between the two side panels instead of straight across. It's not a deal breaker for me but it was a big enough flaw that it bugs me and it speaks to the product quality.The color inside is vivid and pretty. The cushioning and protection is standard for this type of bag in my experience.By the way, I got this in a larger size at the same time and it, too, had not-so-straight seams. Bummer."
2401,"Looks nice, works like you'd expect a silicone keyboard cover to work.  May be great for MacBook/Pro, but not for Air.The keys are black, which looks nice but the printed symbols don't correspond with the keys (Air features a power key in upper-right corner as opposed to the eject key.  This in turn throws all the other function keys off).  The cut also doesn't fit the smaller tray very well and sticks out of the indentation along the top of the keyboard particularly.Again, it may work great for a MBP, but not for the Air."
2402,"I am not quite sure whether this is my case or a universal problem, but I found the black imprint is not in the center of keys."
2403,"Low quality material but it works. Its a bit loose when you put it in the socket, but still it works, so giving it 3 stars."
2404,"I had a 80GB IDE drive I needed to search for some data. The dock was able to power the drive and make it available.Unfortunately, the door on the top for SATA drive broke on the second use. the hinge mechanism seems to have a design flaw that allows it to become jammed. Fortunately it does not impact performance. There's just nothing supporting 2.5 SATA drives when you put them in.Works in Mac OS X and Windows 7."
2405,"This power supply works. Yes, it does get hot (most do) and yes it is short. But it does work. It brought an old computer back to life. In fact, I am writing this review on the machine I bought it for. I have only had this charger for a couple of weeks, so I cannot comment for the longevity of the device. However, I can say that I have left the unit plugged into the device for days straight and have not seen any evidence of warping. Currently, I recommend this charger if you have a budget set to get an old computer up and running. I gave it 4 stars because the cord is short enough to be annoying.UPDATE:After using this charger for a month, I too had encountered the touchpad issue when charging. For those not familiar, when the charger is plugged in, the touchpad tends to not work as good as when running on battery. After some research, it appears that this could be caused by the charger. I have knocked down the rating of this item from 4 stars to 3 as a result. This charger will charge your notebook for a more than reasonable price, but there is a chance that you will encounter some issues as a result of use. I am going to use this charger primarily as a means to charge when not in use. I have ordered an OEM Midnight charger for travel.  For those that care, I experienced this issue on a Midnight Company C D505."
2406,"I tried it with a 3.5"", 4.3"", 4.7"" screen size GPS - they all fit but I had to force all of them in instead of a quick easy removable.Don't go by the screen size, it's actually pretty irrelevant, because many GPS could have a compatible screen size (under the recommended ""fits most 4.3"" sizes), but it can have a thicker outer body than others. The thicker the GPS, the harder it will be to insert and remove from this case. It will be securely held, but it will be very tight. Check the thickness of your GPS body.I'm mainly using this case with a 4.7"" screen GPS (theMagellan RoadMate 1470) and it protects the entire screen; however, the side of the GPS does slightly expose out a bit (not a big deal) and it is a very tight fit. It's easier to insert it, but it takes a certain technique for me to remove it by sticking both of my thumb through the sides of the Company ABasics logo and pushing it out.This ""case"" is more like a glove and it has to be tight because there is no latch or anything that would hold on to the side of the GPS (or else it'll fall off) - it is held by stretching of the elastic sides and having a ""snug"" fit.So if you're very picky about wanting every part of the GPS body protected, it won't be, as one of the sides of your GPS will still be completely exposed.I was worried the elastic strap would break, considering how tight it was for me to keep jamming it in and removing, but it is quite durable.Pros:- Good amount of thickness to protect the screen- Strong Elastic strap- Feels good.Cons:- Very tight fit - can be difficult to insert or remove quickly (more so the latter)- Side of your GPS will still be exposed (not fully protected)Overall, this is an average ""case"". A glove case. It is hard to accommodate a wide range of GPS devices, and the key of this case is solely on the elastic straps to hold on to the sides. The slimmer the GPS, the more comfortable fit it'll probably have with this.  But in the end, it does protect the screen, which is the most important part of GPS devices.Noreve makes some great cases, they make cases specifically for many certain models, but they are quite expensive. However, you get what you pay for."
2407,Cheap not very good only one zipper which is not convenient for charging no handle or anything to grip it could protect your mac from camel scratches at most material thin and has zero impact absorption property anyway I did not expect something outstanding for such money but product lack even basic I would not recommend to buy it just waste of money for so so product
2408,"If you are doing stills or landscapes, you are fine.  But you will miss lots of pics taken of children, pets or action as this has a super slow read speed.  Good quality if you use it for the right thing."
2409,"Um, Got these as backups for a trip to Yellowstone, so that all pix weren't on one card.  Well, I didn't realize I was supposed to format them on a computer prior to use.  The quick format didn't hold, and I had to use recovery software to get the pix off.  All is well that ends well, but I still occasionally have problems with these with errors that the card isn't formatted."
2410,Within a week the strap tore & i had to sew it up! Thought this style worked? Be careful people.
2411,great item fast ship but cant give this item five stars becouse the price was very steep for ram if it was ddr3 instaed of ddr2 i coulda saved some cash to bad
2412,I just was able to use it a few times and then somehow it fell off of the camera and was left with only the diffusers.  Oh well....
2413,"I am currently using LifeCam for Skyping my mother.  She's borrowing myCreative Labs Live! Cam Video IM Ultra 1.3MP Webcam, which I love.  LifeCam is a good webcam, but it just doesn't compare.OUT OF THE BOXI would normally just stick this webcam in the USB port and start using it, but it came with a cardboard tag over the USB plug instructing me to install the CD first, which was a pain, but I did.  It was easy to do.I quickly tried to mount the LifeCam onto my monitor.  It didn't mount well at first, when I tried to do it as instructed on the instruction manual (bend foot into a wide U shape).  I then tried it in an L shape and pressed the bottom bend of the L to the back of my monitor so that the weight of the foot is holding my webcam down.  That works better.On the table, it's great.  Bend the foot into a C shape.  The rubber food provides weight and traction to keep it in one spot.The head of the webcam does not freely swivel like my Live! Cam.  That is a drawback, in my opinion.  It is not easy for me to balance the webcam on my monitor in any other manner than what I have described, which means I have very limited angles when it is mounted on my monitor.SOFTWAREThe LifeCam software gives us the ability to do video and sound capture and save it to a file.  There are special effects that can add a mask or change our heads to alien shapes.  Only one effect is possible at a time.Also included are controls for the LifeCam.  When True Color is activated (it is by default), it will constantly readjust the focus, lighting and color.  I find that highly annoying, since this causes a lot of flickering and blurring as the webcam adjusts.  I turn it off and then go into ""properties"" to TURN OFF ALL THE AUTO ADJUST FEATURES.  That gives me a more stable image.VIDEO QUALITYOnce I've got True Color turned off and the properties manually set as I like (saturation, white balance, etc.), the webcam image is great.  I don't have any problems with it.  My number one tip for this product: **TURN OFF AUTO FOCUS**.SOUNDWhen I test sound on Skype, it works well.  It's also good when I use the audio capture feature of the software.Sound quality when Skyping is a problem, though.  I'm not sure why, as my mom cannot seem to verbalize the problem.  In comparison, my mom only uses the mic that comes with her Live! Cam and her computer speakers and we can hear her just fine.When I switch gears and Skype with just the LifeCam and a headset, she can hear me well.PROS:+ foot has weight and grip for desktop use+ picture quality is goodCONS:- head doesn't swivel freely- mic may not work well for SkypeSUMMARYThis webcam isn't bad, it's just not great.  Given the choice between LifeCam and Live! Cam, I would choose the latter.Live! Cam has a better monitor mount and the head swivels to just about any angle.  It doesn't sit on the desk as well, but I don't use it on my desk.  And lastly, Live! Cam seems to have a better mic for Skyping.  We have no problems hearing my mom when she's using it."
2414,"Technically, this USB hub works very well. It is common for me to use it with five to seven devices plugged in without a problem.The design of the hub, on the other hand, is a disaster. The base is too small to allow the hub to stand with even one device plugged in, it will tip over. I had to put velcro on it and attach it to the side of my PC.The case, while very sleek and modern looking, will pop open at the least provocation. I had to put packing tape over the top of the hub to prevent the side pieces falling off.If it weren't for the terrible design of the case, I would have rated this hub 4 or even 5."
2415,"Wanted to upgrade my old Pentium 4 with IDE (PATA) ports so I could use a SATA hard drive and a SATA DVD burner.  This adapter works fine with the SATA DVD burner.  But with the SATA hard drive, sometimes the computer would stop at different points during booting.  If it finished booting, it would work for a while and then lockup occasionally.  After reading reviews on other brands of adapters, it seems this is not a rare problem when using these types of converters.Finally I gave up on using this adapter for the hard drive and installed a PCI to SATA adapter card and the associated drivers.  All is fine now.  I'm still using one of these adapters for the DVD burner without any problems.  In summary, I would say this is a nice adapter as long as it isn't used on your boot drive."
2416,I loved the idea of this-that i could listen to my music in the car. it was easy to set up. but only works fairly. fades in and out frequently. also is easily broken.
2417,"Its a great device except for two major problems. One, the charger its self is crap not well made and falls apart on you quick and they dont tell you that with out the plug in charger the performance of the unit is greatly reduced, and with that the drain on your ipods battery is incredible it ate half my battery in 45 mins of use. Two, The unit CAN NOT TAKE HEAT, i live in Texas and i left it in the car a few times and it just died. the screen bled over and it was done. So if you live in the north and have a new model ipod with better battery go for it but if not just get one from Monster, they cost a bit more but you get so much more quality."
2418,"This fan was great for a few days and then it died. It's a good fan, nice and quite, and push's a decent ammount of air. I would recommend this for a Front or Rear exhaust placement. It's really cheap in price, i'll have to RMA and get a replacement before i can comment on build quality."
2419,You definitely need one with the Magellan Roadmate for the battery life on the unit is worthless as is questionable if it last the 2 hours.
2420,"I purchased this product largely based on the glowing reviews posted on this website, primarily the very convincing review currently rated most-helpful.  Many have touted this speaker's ""audiophile quality"", great volume, crisp sound, full bass.  I will plead with you to please proceed with caution.  I have been less than thrilled with this purchase.First, we'll tackle the positive aspects of the WOWee One.  It is very portable (smaller than most cordless phone handsets) and one of the easiest plug-n-play devices I've ever owned.  There are virtually no controls to worry about.  You literally plug in your audio device (from which the independently amplified WOWee One gets its volume control) and set it down.  Couldn't be easier, right?The problem is, it just doesn't sound that good to justify the price.  The mid and high range speaker on the WOWee One is surprisingly tinny, much like you'd expect from a child's boom box.  The aspect of the Wowee One that is it's primary curiosity and selling point is it's contact reverberation bass technology.  It's a really cool concept that will initially impress a few friends:  It is touted to use whatever surface you set it on to essentially become the WOWee One's subwoofer.  What you MUST understand is that the bass response is completely dependent on the type of surface you set the Wowee One on, and here's the kicker:  The WOWee One is incredibly finicky.I would estimate that I've tried the speaker out on 50+ surfaces of any variety of material, density, thickness, and size.  If the surface is too solid or dense, it won't vibrate the bass.  If it's too flimsy, it'll rattle and sound broken.  You've got to find a surface that is juuuust right.  (The WOWee One is like the Goldilocks of speaker systems.)  I've found three surfaces where the WOWee One even approaches the much less expensiveAltec Lansing BXR1220 2.0 Speaker SystemI purchased here on Company A:  1)  The seat cushion of a leather recliner (right in the middle, mind you); 2) an aluminum storage shelf; and 3). a tipped-over large plastic garbage can.  I've got to be honest when I say that none of those surfaces is particularly convenient for hangin' out with my iPod.  Every other surface I've tried has left me wanting... something else.  This has been a major disappointment for a guy who loves to take music wherever he goes.  I wasn't truly hoping to have an ""audiophile quality"" speaker for under $100, but I was expecting it to sound better than my daughter'sSony CD Boombox with Digital AM/FM Tuner (Red).I feel that this product can fairly be rated as a three-star speaker (though I wrestled with giving it two stars just for failed expectations).  It'll be a fun curiosity to show and share with friends and to act as a very portable, very easy to use amp for an iPod/MP3 player.  After a few minutes of listening, though, just don't expect to hear anyone say, ""WOWee""."
2421,"bought on 1/6/2011, and got them 1/10/2010. Each drive came in a box which contained plastic molds which held drive in anti-static bag suspended in the box - rate packaging OK. Only instructions are printed on the drive, and there are no other documentation or parts - knew about no other parts as described as bare drive. As it turns out, tower PC has built-in drive holders & mounting screws with everything (SATA signal and power cables) so no need for any other parts such as screws. The date of the drives was 30-31 Oct 2010. Registered the drives on [...] and got warranty dated 2/4/2014 which means the warranty began on date of purchase not date printed on the drive. Someone complained about printed dates being start warranty date which is not quite correct. Just started formatting the drive with Microsoft Vista OS and 4096 size. Will update on success of formatting and use. The drive is quietier than the power fan on the tower PC - cant hear drive being formatted. Will send in for $20 rebate. So $[...] minus rebate sounds like a good deal. Looked at other drive makers, and all give 3 yr warranty. There was WD black box version warrantied for 5 yrs, but cost was a lot more. It'll be interesting to see how it performs green versus non-green 7200 RPM 1 TB drive.1/12/2010Could not sucessfully format with Vista OS (tried two drives gave up after over 8 hours), but was able to format with Windows 7 (used OS disk management Create..., default settings for NTFS). Very quiet when formatting, but can hear drive when using formatted drives. The drive runs warm during formatting. Transferring all data from another drive so have to see if files are OK.Usedhttp://g-ecx.images-Company A.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/WD-Visa-Offer.pdf to get rebate form."
2422,"It is a large card, so even though I have a tower, the fan portion bumped against the plastic housing of the heat sink for the CPU.  And, the plug in ports did not align with the openings in the case.  For the heat sink housing, I removed some of the plastic case, and there was sufficient room.  For the rear plug openings, I had to do some metal bending.For my Mother Board, the PCI express slot is not at the bottom.  And while there is plenty of room above the PCIe slot, the length of the card was what caused a tight fit.It is a very quiet card, and the fan seems robust.  Driver download was simple, and I am using Windows 7.The benchmarks improved over the NVIDIA card that I replaced, due to the fan failing on the card.It only gets three stars because I get a purple color cast on the Nikon ViewNX program for my imported digital pictures. Once the file is converted from NEF file to JPG file, the color is perfect.  I realize this is only a setting issue, but it is annoying and will take awhile to figure out."
2423,I found out it uses up to 5W even when not used.Since my satellite box has to be on (all the time) for my DVR then the solution to save those 5W is to disconnect the cable coming from my satellite box. The rest of the boxes are off so it cannot pull 5W.So when I'm ready to switch inputs I have to connect the cable.When I'm doing switching then I disconnect. The only way to save those 5W wasted for life.
2424,"Headset works fine and audio quality is fine; Reasonably-priced, compact, combination microphone-headsets are hard to find.  However, it only fits on the left ear.  Earpod is very large and is uncomfortable in the ear."
2425,Product is very good. Be sure to hold it up to the TV before you stick the Velcro to it just to be sure you like itThis has saved my TV from a 2 year old.. throwing things and drawing on it with crayons
2426,"I'm not an audiophile, but it sounds fine to me. My problems are with how it reads a USB thumbdrive, and a couple of other things. BTW, this is my first receiver with the USB feature, so if all the other car audio units work this way, my complaint would extend to them also. Problem: the tracks won't play in the order listed in the file name. Let's say you have a piece of music in three sections, file name thus (name of piece - 01, name of piece - 02, name of piece - 03). When you do this on your PC, your player plays back in that order. Not so when you transfer the same files to your USB thumb drive. The trick is that you have you have to grab first 01, copy that to the thumbie, then 02 and then 03. They play back in the order they were recorded, files names apparently have nothing to do with it. That's not convenient! Also, you'll probably want to set up folders to put these files into--that way you can more easily navigate from one set of tracks to another. That may be necessary for all units, since you are presumably driving and can't have a screen showing a whole lot of the tracks because it wouldn't be safe.That gets me to the next problem, the display. You can press a button to scan the track name, after holding the button in for what to me is a long time (couple of seconds rather than just tapping it). The displayed text is kind of jerky but readable. I would rather have the track name scroll automatically for a short time, then dim (for driving safety). The menu structure seemed anything but intutive to me, but not sure any other units would be better at this. For example, in my car radio, if I was listening to someone speaking and wanted to turn down the bass so it was more understandable, it was easy. With this unit, I wouldn't even bother, as I suspect many others won't either."
2427,"The keyboard is easy to set up and the program loads with little trouble. The range is good, was able to get a signal up to 10' away from the micro receiver, which stores inside the mouse battery compartment. However the connection proved problematic at times. While the computer was opening certain programs like Quickens or Adobe Photoshop, which are heavy CPU loads, the connection would be lost and would not return automatically when the load dropped.  The fix was easy, simply pull the USB receiver and then reinsert it.The mouse only has three buttons, the right/left click and scroll wheel. The addition of a back button would complicate the ambidextrous use of the mouse, but to me is required feature in any mouse. The surface of the mouse was also lacking in that it had no comfort grip or texture, which in addition to its smaller size makes it hard to handle. Would recommend more thought into the mouse for future models or just dropping it from the unit.The keyboard is the redeeming feature of this product. It easily fits in your lap and in any of briefcase/backpack. While it takes a little getting used to, touch typing is very easy with no noticeable cramping of the keys. The response time is almost unnoticeable; there is no lag due to the wireless nature."
2428,"It keep disconnecting, everything interferes with it signal I just use it as a back up, but if you want something small and that you can take with you is ok."
2429,I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas.  The sound is excellent and it is easy to operate. (she's 3).  The only problem is that the headphones I bought to match do not work with it since there is a short in the wiring for the headphones.  We have to use the headphones with our Sony but she likes how easy this CD player is to operate.
2430,3 stars because of spammy behavior that begs for reviews. Product itself is 4 or 5 stars -- time will tell.
2431,"I am not too sure about this yet. Its very bright. The problem I run into is because of the way it attaches to the lens, I have a hard time focusing the lens. In autofocus, the lens moves the light all around. I will have to play with it more to see if I am going to like it or not."
2432,"This looks to be adequate, though unremarkable.  Once mounted, the camera becomes substantially larger, removiimg the small size advantage of the Veho."
2433,"Bought this because the interference while my 4 Gen I Pod Nano was charging and playing through the AUX cable was unbearable.  The sound this device provides has fairly strong background static and mutes out the music but it is better than the previous interference without the device.  I found turning the volume all the way up on my I Pod helps eliminate some of the static (just have to remember to turn it down before I unplug from my vehicle and go for a run), but you still lose a lot of sound quality.I will probably use my FM tuner to play music most of the time, and when there is interference through the radio I will use the Kensington AUX cable as a back up until the radio comes in clear again.  I set it up so I just have to push AM/FM button or AUX button on Jeep radio."
2434,"I bought this camera in the summer of 2010 as a birthday present for myself and it worked perfectly fine for about 6 months, then the BLUR monster must have attacked its insides. It takes blurry pictures most of the time now and the steady shot features does NOT work properly at all, neither does the automatic take when smiling feature. It's just decent overall."
2435,"I got two of these to demonstrate our touch screen software in trade shows.The build is pretty solid and while lots of plastic are used, it looks and feels pretty stylish.  The CPU is slightly under powered, and coupled with the slight lag of the touch screen, makes the overall experience a bit lacking.The screen is nice and crisp though, and the unit is pretty enjoyable when used as a straight netbook.I also put in a 64GB Solid State Disk and it makes the netbook much more enjoyable to use.  (It boots faster and everything seems much snappier.)"
2436,"I'm not happy about the delay between songs connected via a usb stick. random is the same 10 songs forever. will update more, but keep expectations low when purchasing."
2437,"For the price, this does the job.  For me, the big plus was no tapes to download in real time to the computer or dvd recorder.  Battery life is pretty weak-about an hour, which is surprising/disappointing given that there's no tape or dvd motor to run-just a straight recording to the internal memory.  The one thing I really don't like, and perhaps this is just because I haven't figured out an alternative, is that the unit has to be turned off before using a different function-eg. after transferring a clip to the computer, you have to shut the camcorder off and restart it to delete the clip from the camcorder's memory.  Kind of annoying"
2438,"It was ok, nice size and very easy to use. But the burn is very slow. If you burn lots of movies like I do. I would recommend something that is faster."
2439,Low cost NDVI camera.  Easy to convert but I suspect the autofocus was semi functional before I purchased it.  Inexpensive and fairly priced as other sellers have taken advantage of people looking to DIY their own NDVI solution.  No complaints about the seller.
2440,"Orderd on Monday Night recieve on Saturday. Great delivery, but the unit is under designed and flimsy. Unit sags under a 10.1"" netbook. I had the cooler on the floor but one fan got buried in the carpet; so we had to put in on a stiffer surface.As part of my job I design plastic parts, all they would have to do is machine grooves into the mold to add cross ribs to stiffen up the thin flat clear plastic and use a stiffer plastic (of course costs more than the plastic they used).I have some left over adhesive backed press-on rubber feet I will be attaching (stacking on the bottom) and adding to the top to help support the netbook away from the fans to get better air flow.The power cord is not well supported. There is a little hook on the bottom molded in but the cord just pops out. So, I will be adding an adhesive backed cable mount and a zip time to secure the cable.The power cable has a nice feature, the USB plug is a feedthru, so you can plug in USB device on the back of the plug, so you don't loose your USB port or have to use a hub.My unit is not as pictured, the fans are opposie of the image showing one fan at top and two at the bottom. One fan has sky blue LED's while the other two fans have medium blue LEDs. Also there are no finger guards, but I tested the fans and the blades stop immedately when a finger is present.It is also a bit of a power hog. I had to use power adapter because it drained the battery while I was downloading updates.There is already a crack in the plastic, used it only once, and orginally thought it was a scratch. Barely typed on it and was using wireless mouse. I am going give them a second chance and ask for a replacment."
2441,"These batteries fit my DMC-FZ35 and work fine.  I tend to take a couple of pictures here and there.  They seem to work okay if you use them the same day you charge them, but they have a very high internal resistance.  I can charge the Original Panasonic battery and leave it in the camera for a couple of months.  These will discharge all the way to zero within a couple of weeks.They don't really fit the way I typically use my camera, but they'll come in handy on vacations when you need a fresh battery and can charge them every night.*Update* About a year ago, I attempted to use these, and they didn't seem to take a charge.  I double checked everything today, and sure enough, they're both completely dead - will not even turn the camera on."
2442,"It works.  That's good.  But this is by far the thinnest and flimsiest cable that I've ever seen.  Don't pull on it!  It was also the cheapest cable, so don't expect miracles."
2443,"Out of the box, the unit was simple to place in line. I was unable to register or bring my unit into the internet, so I contacted customer support using their email support system. To their credit, they responded within a few hours and their tech said he'd successfully accessed my unit. Sure enough, I had access -- a great leap, but that's not all Pogoplug promises.I Immediately began having trouble accessing my drive with their software, which is one of the features that helps this behave like just another folder on your desktop. After several uninstalls and reinstalls at the suggestion of their tech support, I was urged to try their new beta software that has an added bonus feature -- it can make your PC available as well as the hard drive on your pogoplug.It worked, but all my exe files were immediately changed into LNK files and would no longer work. The only way I could access my software was to double click an existing document, except that Internet Explorer continued to work normally. I uninstalled the Pogoplug beta and tried doing a system restore. That didn't work --generic error message (unable to restore).I went online and searched on the LNK problem and found several forums with the same complaint -- blamed a virus or worm for the problem. Ok -- I don't know why after many years of conservative internet use I should suddenly develop a malware, the visible symptoms of which every exe icon on my computer became a pogoplug icon -- I don't believe in coincidences.  The forums recommended a MS fixit software plus a malware scan. I did both and that corrected the problem. Ok -- maybe Pogoplug is off the hook for that problem.I should note that throughout all this I still had access to my hard drive through my web browser -- which is indeed handy.  I'm also using the Droid app on my EVO, and that has continued to work.BUT -- the advertising promised streaming video content, and that doesn't work with my EVO -- not on a good and solid wifi, not on 3G and not on 4G. It attempts to run a 10 second ""preview"" and then offers to download the video content to my phone.  That's not streaming -- it takes lots of time for that download, on wifi, on 3G and on 4G -- I've tried all four.As of now, I don't have the desktop software loaded and am worried about going through that again, but I know I must try it or lose an important feature that represents one of the key reasons I wanted PogoPlug. I also don't have a way to stream video to my EVO except by downloading from my Tivo. Not the best of solutions.At this price, it would be an exceptional value if it worked as advertised. I don't yet know what the problem is, so I don't know what the solution will be.  I'll update as (if) I make progress.Updated March 24 -- Requested and received a call from PogoPlug -- which I appreciated very much. It took them a couple of days to get back to me, but that's understandable since I raised some issues that needed a little research. The guy who called was calling from Israel -- I consider that service above and beyond . . .My panic over the corruption of my exe files was solved with the microsoft fix and a malware scan, so Pogoplug was not the source of that panic, as I said earlier.The issues that remain.  1) I still do not have access to my pogoplug through my desktop application, only through my browser. That gives me access to the files, and lets me upload, but removes the ease of use feature of treating it as a desktop folder.  2) I still cannot stream videos -- I get their ten-second previews and nothing happens when I follow their error message suggesting I optimize the video. This is a complex issue that is not entirely a pogoplug problem. I am downloading video from my Tivo, and using the Tivo conversion software to make stuff available to my phone. It works great on my IPOD Touch, but I want it on Android (EVO) and I have not succeeded in making that work. I expect I'll continue playing with the settings in the chain of events that gets a video from the cable, into my Tivo, and onto my hard drive in a way that it becomes available for streaming on my EVO. 3) Their file sorting protocol is really troublesome. I'd like to sort first by type, then alphabetically. Can't do both.I've upgraded my rating from 2 to 3 and will update again when I get some solutions to these remaining problems. In the meantime, I have my own personal cloud, available on any computer and on my phone, and if I have access to wifi, on my IPOD Touch, anywhere in the world, and that's a big deal and pogoplug looks like a very good and very simple way to achieve that. As soon as these other problems get resolved, I'll be dumping Dropbox, which is a great service, but the free version is quite limited."
2444,"Let's review this for what it is; an incredibly inexpensive auxiliary cord for 3.5 mm headphone jack.  I buy these in bulk and expect 2-6 months of use before the connection pulls free from the head.  Reinforcement is does not seem to extend useful life.  Sound quality is fine, with little noise but no insulation from interference."
2445,"Pros:> Very Fast> High quality> Easy setupCons:> Mine came with what I think is a defect, so it has really bad signal, so I don't get much out of it.> Horrible tech support"
2446,The card installed easily enough and it did give me Wi-Fi service but I'm not able to get gig speed so I'm disappointed about that. It's not a distance thing since the router is only 2 feet away. For average use I suppose you won't even notice a difference.
2447,"I've owned these earbuds for several months now, so I feel qualified to give an informed review based on my experience.As for sound, others written more, and you can read their input.  As for me, I have been content with the sound and have not complaints.  The earbuds have been durable and are well made.  They are almost, *almost*, exactly what I want.My suggestions deal with the fit, which is sometimes cumbersome.Some changes that I would like to see:1)  Remove the volume control on the cord.  Totally unnecessary, never used, and adds to the bulkiness of the unit.  The volume control attaches to your shirt collar with a pen clip.  You'll want to secure the volume control on your shirt or jacket somewhere or otherwise because it jangles and pulls on the cord and subsequently the earbuds in your ears, distracting you from your run.  If you need to adjust your volume, just use your device.As for securing the cord of the headphones, the gator clip that is provided is great and all that is needed.2)  Even more necessary is changing the design of the part of the headphones that fits over your ears.  The bend in the plastic is too high and interferes when you want to put on sunglasses.  When I wear sunglasses for the sun or the wind, I always have to put the legs of the glasses a little higher up on my head, altering the fit.  Also, wearing a runners brimmed hat always takes some extra adjusting.For one reason or another, I have tried to find earbud headphones to use for my runs, but without fail, I can't keep them in.  They always pop out.  So, I have to use the buds that have the neckband.  The 680's are adequate, but still looking for the ""perfect"" earbuds for my run."
2448,"Great price and works. Laptop will warn you it's not genuine Lenovo all the time, which is a bit annoying. Also, at about 30%, it's looses juice very quickly. Other than that, it brought new life into my old ThinkPad. All in all, I'd recommend it."
2449,"This mouse is a replacement for my MX620. I wanted a mouse that was ergonomic-shaped for right hand use and has the scroll wheel for zipping through documents.  The scroll wheel works fine on my unit, though some have had complaints.  Perhaps there are some quality control issues causing unit to unit variations.The mouse is noticeably smaller than the MX620 and slightly larger than an ergonomic-shaped travel mouse that I also own (Asus BX700).  Most of the reduced size is in length, while the width of the mouse is almost the same as the MX620. I find the size and shape to be comfortable though people with large hands may want to beware.The problem with this mouse is that the tracking is not smooth. It takes a tiny fraction of a second to start tracking from a still position and has a certain ""dragginess"" to the tracking that is hard to describe. In light of a previous review I measured the distance from the receiver (on a USB hub) to the mouse and it's only 16 inches with a clear line of sight.  This leads me to believe that it's genuinely a problem with tracking rather than signal strength.In marked contrast to the MX620 this mouse hurts to use after a while.  I don't think it's the shape or size but rather the tracking problems mean that it takes more effort to control the mouse.I'm keeping this mouse in the hope that I can get used to it eventually.  But I'm also on the lookout for a similar or larger right-handed mouse with better tracking."
2450,"Where is the antenna in your car? Because if it is in the front, this product works well, but in a car where the antenna is in the back we've had nothing but issues. Purchased two as gifts, one was well received, the other I see tossed in the backseat in it's case. Good idea but not very happy that four feet of space disrupts signal so much. Wasn't worth the time to return. Bought an ac adapter for use in the house also and as long as its close to the radio works fine."
2451,"The product works, you just have to wait a long time for delivery. Way too long. I found these at Fry's Electronics, and got them before these came, even though I ordered them weeks after."
2452,"Purchased this TV in March and already have a dead pixel. I'm trying to ignore it, otherwise the TV is great. The set-up was easy and the picture, even in non-HD is awesome since making corrections to the factory color settings."
2453,I had Microsoft mouse before and this one seems to have less quality than the previous version.  I would say it is about worth the value of the money you paid.  But I probably won't buy another one.
2454,"The size is very good, but the images and video are not very good.  This seems about the same quality as my iphone 4, and not as good as my iphone 5.  If you want good quality, I would suggest getting a dslr camera, and if you are worried about size, get a good camera phone like iphone or a nokia."
2455,"I have been on a quest for a new pair of earphones for weeks. I have spent countless hours reading hundreds of reviews on various models. My main criteria (in order of importance) were: 1) Don't fall out when doing strenuous exercise like running, 2) Won't cease functioning or experience a decrease in functionality due to sweating (I sweat profusely when exercising, e.g., my clothes are normally drenched after an hour of cardio), 3) Comfort, 4) Price, 5) Sound quality, and 6) Appearance/Style.Based on all that I read, I decided that the new  Adidas-branded Sports line from Sennheiser might be the best option for me. Note that I prefer the in-ear design, but was also considering the neckband design of the PMX680 as an alternate. However, I was hoping to find one pair that I could use for cardio, weightlifting, leisure, and travel.First, I will explain what comes in the package. You get:(1) SYMMETRICAL earphones with a  30"" cord and a straight jack(2) a 24"" extender with a volume control on one end and an ""L"" jack on the other(3) a Velcro carrying pouch(4) 3 sets (S,M,L) of earfins, 1 set of M covers w/o fins,  and 3 sets  (S,M,L) of  earbud covers(5) a clip(6) a cleaning toolMy assessment of each of these components:(1) Short Cord: Used w/o the extender, the earphones are best worn using an armband (either arm is fine due to the symmetrical cord) with the cord clipped to the shirt on whatever side the armband is to reduce tension on the opposite side earbud. I ran for 1.5 hours last night with the cord clipped this way to the collar of a T-shirt. It stayed in place the entire time and was completely unobtrusive.(2) Extender: The volume control is very light and can be clipped to the band of your shorts w/o adding noticeable weight. With my iPod Nano clipped to one side, the volume control on the other, and the cord beneath my shirt, there was some cord slack (I'm 5'8""), but the movement was not excessive and not disruptive. The wheel of the volume control has a slight resistance to it so that you won't mistakenly blast out your eardrums while adjusting it.(3) Pouch: The pouch is good quality and roomy enough to hold the earbuds and a small music player. However, the cords do tend to become entangled easily.(4) Earbuds/Earfins: With some trial and error I was able to find the right combination of fin and earbud that fit comfortably and didn't fall out with movement or sweat. I've had more difficulty finding the correct fit for my L ear, but even during a 1.5 hour run I only had to adjust the bud once b/c the fin had moved (Note that the earbud itself was still firmly sealed).(5) Clip: As mentioned above, the clip work great when attached to a collar and probably would also with a hem. I tried to use it in the middle of my shirt and it simply fell off. There's a groove on the top that seemingly is supposed to hold the wire but it does not; you simply have to clip the wire along with the clothing.(6) I have yet to use the cleaning tool.Now on to how the CX680 ranks using my criteria.(1) Fit & Staying Power, 5/5: These things stay put. I've had the stock earbuds which do not fit my ears well, fall out with movement or sweat, and sound crappy. I would imagine that most people should be able to find an earfin/earbud combination that fits them well. I like that this product is customizable rather than one-size-fits-all.(2) Sweat Resistance, 5/5: More than any other pair of earbuds I've owned, these seem to be unaffected by sweating. They do not loosen when sweat is in the ears and their rubberized materials seem especially sweat ""proof"". I have not yet tried to put them in water. I would hope that these do not as easily succumb to the issues common with other earphones that seem less sturdy/durable. Even if they do fail at some point, at least with Sennheiser you have their 2 year warranty (another reason I chose these over something with only a 90 day warranty).(3) Comfort, 5/5: I don't even notice I've wearing them.(4) Price, 3/5: These certainly are not the cheapest earphones on the market, but they are new and will likely come down in price. The cheapest I've found is $70 online with free shipping. I would highly recommend buying them locally, seeing if they work for you, and then returning them and buying them for cheaper online. If you've got something that works for you now, I'd say wait for the price to drop on these. If money is no concern, just buy them!(5) Sound quality, 3/5: I'm not an audiophile and I didn't get these b/c I wanted the best sounding buds, and they're not. I listen exclusively to electronic music and they're OK, but slightly lacking in bass. Not sure if ""tinny"" or ""muddy"" are the correct terms, but I've thought that my music sounded better with JBuds J2s (but they would fall out when I'd sweat and shorted out after a year), with Acoustibuds attached to stock earbuds (these sound great and actually stay pretty well during movement and sweating but they're bulky, have to be twisted into the ear canal, and it's challenging to find the sweet spot as far as the ""best"" position for maximum effect), or with over-the-head models (these offend my sense of fashion). The CX680s are not bad, just not the greatest sounding, but I'm willing to sacrifice on music quality to eliminate them moving around, falling out, or breaking b/c of sweat damage.(6) Appearance, 4/5: I don't know why Sennheiser thinks it necessary to make their Sports lines in bright, obnoxious colors (neon green, orange, and now yellow), instead of more muted grays, blacks, or whites, but these are OK. I'm not using them to win any fashion contests, and they're more appealing, IMO, than the neckband, over-the-ears, or over-the-head models.In summary, I give the CX680s a 4/5: They're great for what they're intended (i.e., reduction of slippage due to movement and/or sweat), but could sound better, be less expensive, and reduce the flashy factor. I would also have preferred an asymmetrical cord design so that the earphones could be used w/o the clip when using an armband. Before my 30 day ""trial"" period is over, I will be returning these to Big Box Store and purchasing them online. Hopefully they will prove to be a good investment and a solution to the annoyance of finding the best earphones for sweaty cardio freaks like me.4-28-13 Update: I am dropping the rating to 3 stars (actually more like 2.5). I recently got theSennheiser CX 685 Adidas Sports In-Ear Headphones, which I also reviewed and compared to the CX 680. Basically, the earfin design on the CX 680 is flawed: They are too flexible and tend to pop out of my ear when I'd get really sweaty (which was pretty much everytime I worked out). This issue combined with the fact that one of the earbuds finally gave out, sent me searching for another set.Based on reviews and the change to the design of the earfins, I chose the CX 685. However, after a few wears I noticed the same thing happening with them...they would slip out/loosen from my ear when sweaty. I tried adjusting the height of the hook (in theory a great feature), using a clip on each wire to take the tension off the earbuds, and fitting different sized earbuds covers. These seemed to help, but I still noticed some slippage.I have recently been using theSennheiser PMX 685i Adidas Sports In-Ear Neckband Headphones - Blackas I've been doing a lot of running and these do not fall off. Ever. They let in too much ambient noise for my liking, but not having to adjust the earbuds constantly is a godsend. I will continue to use these exclusively for running and have relegated the CX 685 to my lifting sessions."
2456,"When I purchased my Olympus EP-3 from Company A, at the same time I also ordered this Olympus 14 - 150mm lens for it.  When I pulled it out of the box, I was stunned.  I looked it over to see if I could find the Playskool or Mattel logo on it.  No, it said Olympus, even though it felt and looked like a toy.  This was a very light, very cheaply made lens and I was shocked.  After having used Olympus OM system lenses for over twenty years, I had never seen such a cheaply made Olympus lens.  After using it now for over a half a year, I still feel the same way about it.  Cheap, thin, light, flimsy plastic.  Using my OM system lenses I never had to worry about them.  They were metal.  Solid feeling, tight, smoothly operating, heavy but light.  When you looked at them and held them you could feel QUALITY.  I could attach my long Olympus glass to my OM-2N's and OM-4T's, hang them over my neck or shoulder; I would usually carry two together, sometimes three, and never had to worry about them.  If they bumped into something or someone, I knew they'd be okay.  If a kid was running past me I'd move the camera out of the way for fear the kid would get a concussion if he ran into my lens.  Now if a kid is running past me, I move my camera out of the way because I know his head will crack this lens in half.  The solid, firm, quality zoom motion of the OM system lenses is missing here.  The solid, thick rubber deeply engraved diamond cut band that provided the grip on the OM lenses is gone.  I don't even think the zoom grip on this lens is rubber.  It feels like thin, cheap plastic that provides almost no grip. The beautiful built in lens hoods that slid out from my Olympus zooms and my 200mm and my 500mm Olympus prime lenses are missing here, replaced by a cheap flower petal type lens hood that I had to purcahse separately and attaches poorly.  I'm afraid to twist it on and off for fear of cracking the entire lens. Everything about this lens looks and feels cheap, because it is cheaply made.  When I bought an OM system lens, I knew that lens would last me a life time, and so far after almost 30 years, they all still work.  I know this lens won't last very long even though I'm babying it.On the positive side, this lens provides an AMAZING zoom range that I love.  The 14 - 150mm range equals 28 - 300mm in 35mm.  Now, instead of having to carry two OM cameras to get that kind of range, I only need to carry the EP-3.  Outside in good light the EP-3 can be zoomed and focused amazingly fast and delivers sharp, clear, beautiful pictures throughout the entire zoom range.  Hand holding at 300mm and getting clear crisp shots is no problem.  Now, everything stated so far in this paragraph only holds true if there is plenty of light.  As soon as you start losing light, (or moving indoors) auto focusing becomes harder and when enough light is lost, impossible.  Obviously, as you begin losing light, it is also harder to get clear images as you approach the 150 / 300mm range.  This is a SLOW lens.  It is not for those who want to do low light photography.  My Olympus XZ-1 easily out-performs the EP-3 with this lens.  The Olympus XZ-1, which costs less than half of the EP-3, and less than this lens alone is an amazing camera in good and low light.  So, now I usually carry both my XZ-1 and EP-3 if I'm expecting to move in and out of doors and expecting to have to shoot in good and low light situations.This is a small, light lens with an amazing zoom range.  Small and light are not always good though.  I would much rather this lens was made stronger and faster.  Yes, that means metal, rubber, and more weight and expense.  This feels like a throwaway camera system.  If 35mm technology hadn't been replaced by digital, I could have passed my OM cameras on to my kids.  My EP-3 and 14 -150mm lens may not survive to see December of 2013.  Considering the price, this should be a lens of much better quality.  Although it has an amazing zoom range in a small package, it is limited to well lit situations.  Also, no matter how well it performs in well lit enviornments, it is only a nice lens while it works.  My cheaply made EP-3 is already literally falling apart, (I wrote a review here at Company A on that as well - see EP-3) and I'm certain this lens will soon follow.To sum up, this is a nice lens for well lit situations but don't expect it to last long.  It is cheaply made of cheap materials."
2457,Wont last longcheap plastic made in Chinabut it does the job of charging the batteries.Don't expect this to last very long under hard usage.
2458,its pretty cool even though my girlfriend rarely uses it lol but yeah you get what you pay for and the description is not deceiving at all.
2459,"It can transfer the video from tape to digital video. However, the quality is not good. If you want to watch video on iphone size screen, than it may be good for you. bigger than that, the picture will be blur. Also, there is a black line always on the left side screen and white on the top."
2460,The picture on this tv is very nice and I would love to keep it but I am going to return it because there is a noticable static noise coming from the screen. I'm not sure what is causing it but it's enough to bug me. Everything else about the tv seems pretty good though.
2461,"When I put this on my car radio, I tried with all the frequency available (no radio) and most of the time the sound was like a bad radio station signal. but if you don't have a mp3 usb port in your radio, this is a good choice."
2462,"No one can really argue about these for the price, and they put out pretty decent mid range. I've had a few that are better, but they will work."
2463,The idea of the boxy is great. For the most part it runs well. I can stream videos from my computer or internet to the boxee. Sometimes the system hangs when you are using it or it disconnects itself from the LAN. The main reason I bought this was to watch movies from a hard drive wired directly to the box and this works well but has a limit of 3 Tb. It took hours to find the right firmware to update the boxee and get it connected to the LAN. The video quality is really good. The remote control is a little awkward but works well. The box is small. People talk about it not fitting on a shelf. A DVD case is taller than the box. The HDMI cable it comes with is short. It should be close to your receiver. The weakest part of the boxee is the wireless connection and programming of the software.
2464,We use this for a security camera system so the TV is on 24/7.  It's working fine and the iPod dock is feature is useful but poorly integrated because you can't watch TV (or security camera feed in my case) while the iPod is in the dock for playing music/videos or charging.  I can understand not needing to see tv if listing to music but but what if you're using it to charge the product?
2465,"These have a full sound and are pretty efficient but don't have much depth. My reference is a pair of Etymotic ER6 earphones. My ER6 earphones are getting pretty old so I needed a stand in until I could get a new pair. These M9s have a big sound, lots of bass and for a similar volume are much louder. They really block out ambient noise very well with the double flange tips supplied. None of the tips supplied are as comfortable as my Etymotic two flange tips and I'm on the look out replacements that are tight without feeling full. The M9 tips are a soft and filling but not firm and tight feeling. The main reason I prefer my old earphone is because of the sense of ""depth"". These M9s don't give you a sense of position in space of the sound you hear. They're not like ""being there"" which I think is better than being loud. I'm not some fancy audiophile with acute hearing so if I can detect this it would be more even more apparent to you. The M9s are clear enough to hear little details in the music or recording its just all that sound is up in your ears and not ""out there"".I like the Bluetooth receiver so far. Powers my old earphones nicely and I haven't heard any extra sounds or distortion as of yet. So it has been a good purchase.If I get any increase in depth after breaking them in I will be sure to post a retraction otherwise they are only three stars. Great price and value but more faithful sound can be had."
2466,"This bag is attractive and well made, but the description does not really prepare you for just how small that it is.  I was expecting to be able to store a Micro 4/3 camera with a lens on it and at least one additional lens in the bag, as well as basic accessories like a spare battery or two, and a couple of extra memory cards.  The fact is, this will only be possible if the camera itself is small, and both the lens on the camera and the spare lens is also quite small.  Like maybe the 14-42 kit lens and a small pancake prime.  Don't expect it to be able to fit both the camera and a small lens and any sort of telephoto as well.  After getting this, I picked up a LowePro Edit 130 for less money that is probably about 50% larger inside, and can do what I need it to do."
2467,"This keyboard does have problems, for me at least.  The nibs on the G and H keys lasted only about one year and after that it was eye down on the board to get the hands placed correctly.  A nuisance but not an unusual problem.  I also had to keep canned air handy as almost anything that got down into the keyboard would cause a key to stop working. I got in the habit of blowing out debris monthly.  Another nuisance but not a fatal flaw.  Then, at 18 months the space bar got intermittent and stopped working all within 10 minutes. I pulled the space bar up and cleaned and fiddled but the little silicon rubber thing just would no longer trigger the membrane key under it.  I average about 3 hours per day writing reports and expected more than 18 months out of a fairly expensive keyboard.In spite of the nuisance issues, it's the best keyboard I've ever owned.  Typically I tire or get frustrated with a keyboard long before it fails (have a closet full of them) but could have used this one the rest of my life.So, not sure how to rank this.  I expected better life.  Maybe I'm expecting too much.UPDATE ................................After posting this review, I recalled that this keyboard has a long warranty (5 years) so I emailed SIIG about the problem and within an hour got an RMA number and a promise that a ""new replacement"" would be sent out as soon as SIIG receives my failed keyboard.  Very pleased!"
2468,"I've had the receiver for over a year now.  I also purchased new Polk Audio front & center speakers.  Has great power, great sound quality, and great features such as iPhone integration.  I've been having some issues with power and cannot pinpoint the issue.  My receiver reboots/resets periodically.  Its not related to volume or source, each situation is random.  I can crank music from my iPod and it will shutdown, or I can watch ESPN at a low/moderate volume and it will shutdown.  Steep learning curve on all the features for people who are NOT tech savvy.  Internet radio only has preset channels, cannot add new channels.  7.1 Surround is spectacular if you have good speakers and Blu-Ray player.  I had it placed inside a cabinet with the door open an it produces alot of heat.  I've moved it into the open but the random resets still keep happening.  Might try a Yamaha in another year.  Resets are not frequent enough to justify purchasing another unit.  They are more annoying than anything else."
2469,"Pros:+Front loading USB port.+Plays music from USB stick very well.+Music on the USB picks up at exact same point as when you turned it off.Cons:+Not easy to figure out how in what order it will play songs in USB folder.+The 'wheel control' in the middle of this product is way too small for most adults to handle easily. It sits too close to the front to get a good grip on it. There is a good reason it comes with a remote, it's much easier to use.+The equalizer controls are difficult to figure out and not easily changed. If that is important to you, skip this model.+All of the controls on the front are very small.... once again, use the remote.+Did not fit 2006 GM antenna connection.+GM radios have the feature that controls the volume as you speed up and slow down the vehicle - you will lose that.+The clock feature is buried in the confusing menus.+You can either have the clock on -or- have the music title on - but not bothIf you have the means, I would recommend checking this out in person at a Best Buy (or similar store) before ordering to make sure you like the feel of the controls. Company A's price was about 1/2 of what Best Buy is asking for the same model. I have not used the HD Radio or iPod with it yet."
2470,"I didnt need 6 pairs but it was still one of the cheapest that I could order so I went ahead with it.They are decent, what you pay is what you get, but just too thin, almost provides no padding. I just used three pair on top of each other. I would suggest trying some other ear pads if you want enough padding."
2471,The device has to good price.  Yo get what you paid for...There are no complaint that I've have so far
2472,"These are very attractive and have a great sound. However, I was surprised how uncomfortable this product was after reading the reviews. I found the ""air cushion"" to hurt after wearing the headset for about 20 minutes. I think the headset is supposed to help block sound but it digs into and hurts my ears. Maybe I have very small ears."
2473,"This is a new product line for the Harmony brand, designed to be for the first time Harmony user.  The upside is the low price and fairly simple web programming interface.  The downside is that this setup doesn't allow punch-through programming.  Punch-through programming is using the buttons of one device mode to control a different device.  The obvious example is the volume buttons controlling the TV while the channel buttons control the cable box.  This Harmony will do that, but you can't remap other buttons without having the original remotes to train this remote.  For example, you might want to assign one of the buttons in the cable mode to control the sleep function of the TV; you can't do this without having the original remotes.Another minor issue, if you assign a function to one of the buttons, you can't remove the function from the button leaving the button non-functional."
2474,The card is great but it seems that every time I have to restart the system to upgrade Windows or there is a power failure (we have a lot of them) in the area I have to go through the long time consuming process of having Comcast send and activation signal to the card.
2475,"The Q Knot Cable Tie definitely works, but it's not an effortless way of securing something. If you're tying off an electrical cord that you'll only use occasionally, I suppose it's OK, but if you're going to use it daily, say for sealing a bread bag, I think there are better items, like a bag clip.The biggest issue with this tie is that it doesn't thread easily, and requires a fair amount of work to release it. That's why I think it's OK for occasional use, but not for something you'd access every day."
2476,It is well made and works fine. I used it for a Henge Dock which I needed to shave it down. So if you need it for a Henge you will need to modify it.  Other wise it works just fine.
2477,"I purchased this receiver in June 2010 and so have had time to digest all the options and features of this product so that I can provide a fair review.  I use this receiver primarily for home theater and its been excellent so I rate the product 5 stars.  I havent run into the video issues that have been mentioned in prior posts.  Currently, my receiver powers two Polk RTi10 floor standing speakers, a HSU subwoofer, a Polk CSi A6 center channnel speaker and two Polk bookshelf rear speakers.  Its connected to my Panasonic 50"" LCD projection TV via HDMI and the main input is a Sony BDP 570 blu ray player connected via HDMI.  It took me about 6 months to really tweak the setting to my liking but thats one of the great features about this reciever is that there are numerous options to change the sound to your preference.  The first and most obvious thing to do once your ready is to run the Audyssey 2EQ Speaker Setup function and then you can tweak from there, if needed.A few things to note that I gathered from trial and error and from trolling all the AVS forums about this receiver.  When I first started playing blu ray movies I noticed the dialogue tended to be very weak and the explosions and sound effects were very loud.  All the speakers were connected properly and it wasnt the blu ray player because I tried a different brand player and got the same results.  To solve this problem, I found that setting the Onkyo Dynamic Volume option from OFF to LIGHT makes a huge difference in sound.  It will do a light compression on the sound, which some audio purist may be opposed to but it makes the dialogue so much better and louder and based on what I hear, it doesnt degrade the overall sound at all.  Just make sure you have a decent center channel speaker to handle it, otherwise you might have to decrease the center speaker setting down a couple of db's.  The other thing I noticed is that this reciever has a Late Night setting which lowers the overall volume for evening viewing if you don't want to wake your neighbors.  This setting is defaulted to Auto.  However, when playing certain movies it will trigger the Late Night feature and the volume is very muted.  This happened to me when I played Star Trek and I realized that I need to switch the Late Night setting from Auto to OFF.  This makes a big difference in sound.  The feature only applies for discs with Dolby True HD sound.  The final observation I made was that the volume level will typically be at a 50% setting for decent sound.  I initially thought this was too high because my old Technics reciever would get really loud when I had the volume turned up to 25%.  I found out later that 50% is about right and its not an issue of weakness in the reciever because this reciever is plenty powerful.As a final note, I purchased this product on Company A and received it no problem with free shipping and no taxes so rest assured that Company A's delivery is just as reliable for electronics as it is for books.  When I ordered this it was based on reading countless reviews here and on CNET and other audio video websites and forums.  I never went to any store to physically test out the product so it was a leap of faith on my part that I was ordering based soley on what I read and Onkyo's reputation for putting out quality audio equipment.  So far I have not been disappointed in my decision.UPDATE July 2013: I decided to recently retire this receiver and upgrade to a Marantz receiver.  In hindsight, looking back on my experience with this product I would say that it wasn't great.  I'm saying this because after hearing the sound produced from the Marantz when compared to the Onkyo I find that the Marantz produces a more balanced and warmer sound whereas the Onkyo sounds a little more harsh when the volume is turned up.  Also, for some reason whenever I start up a movie with the Onkyo it seems like the sound is a tad muted so I would go into the receiver menu options and switch the dynamic volume from Light to Off and back to Light and that would bring the sound back to normal levels.  I had to do this everytime I watched a movie and it would only work for movies encoded in DTS-MA.  Additionally, I had some HDMI issues where I would suddenly lose video and audio in the middle of a 3D movie.  I had to tinker with the connections for a few hours by trying other receiver inputs which seemed to work but I would run into instances where the video would show but the audio would cut in and out.  Eventually everything started working again and I couldn't tell if it was because of my tinkering or it just fixed itself.  So that experience left me a little uneasy.  One note - if you are watching high definition in Blu Ray with this receiver then one of the biggest adjustments you need to do is to turn off the video processing function.  The details on how to do that can be found in the other reviews here.  I can tell you it makes a huge difference in video quality especially if you are sending a 1080p 24fps video signal from the player and the tv is 1080p compatible.  The video processer really dulls down the picture but if you turn it off the picture is a lot sharper and pops from the screen.  At the end of the day I felt that the combination of all the tweaking and adjustments that you need to make to get around all the different issues encountered with this receiver did not warrant a 5 star rating product and therefore I downgraded the rating accordingly even though this is a discontinued product."
2478,"To all hackers: I bought this drive after reading somewhere that Toshiba is building 9.5mm (i.e. standard thickness) drives into their Canvio line. My intention was to disassemble the unit and put the drive into my laptop internally.After I finally cracked the case open (it's not too hard, start around the LED light with a blade, it gets easier as the tabs pop open), I realized that it's the ""thick"" 12.5mm hard disk inside!I'm screwed with this. Can't return it because I damaged the case in the process and I don't really have a need for a 750GB external hard drive.Other than that, it's a solid product, with VERY QUIET operation, so if you're not planning to do hacking like I did, you'll be fine."
2479,"I like the case and color.  It comes in a cool box.  The sound is great and the noise isolation is actually decent.  The material is soft on your skin too.That said, for me, the sound leaking is its biggest problem.  Those little grate looking things at the bottom are pretty much straight conduits to the speakers.  When I cover those with my finger the noise coming out is almost completely gone.  I like to listen to my music loud in a relatively quiet office.  Can't turn these up loud enough for me or my neighbors can hear it.  If you aren't worried about that and can turn them up you will like the sound.  I was excited about the mic cable, but have you ever tried to talk to someone with earplugs in?  This is kinda the same thing.  These are noise isolating so with both ears covered you can't really tell how loud you are talking and it is weird.Two other issues that I saw other readers mention but thought it was funny they would think to complain about them are:1) how tightly they squeeze your head. doesn't seem like a big deal till you wear these.  i definitely have a narrow head and these were almost too much for me.2) the choking feeling when they are around your neck.  you can't have these on your neck and look down with your head.  the ear cup things sit right under your chin and touch your throat and I have them open the entire way.  even sitting at my desk my head is normally tilted down a little and I cant wear them like that.  if they are resting on my neck the ear cups are turned to the left or to the right so they are resting on my shoulder rather than my throat."
2480,"These are very good $50.00 in the ear phones.  These are good $100.00 phones.  They are not anything that approaches a $250.00 phone.  As a owner of multiple in ear phones who spends much of his life in an airplane I am always looking for a good phone with better than average sound, above average inactive noise cancellation, and comfortable fit for a couple of an hours at a time.  These phones are only good, at best in any of these categories.  Not disappointing at $50.00 but not a steal."
2481,"This antenna worked as expected but the ray dome separated from the base and had to be reattached.The way this antenna is made there is a chance for ray dome separation from the kind of glue that wasused to attach it to the base.  My fix was to scratch the inside of the base with a file, and the bottom ofthe ray dome with a file and reglue the radiome with J B Weld.  So far this fix has worked.  3 of the 4antennas from this company bought by me and my friends have separated.  TL link needs to changetheir method of attachment of the ray dome. The glue they are using doesn't seem to adhere to thechrome plated base.  (Just my humble opinion)  It was too much trouble to return the antenna so I justreglued it myself with J B WELD."
2482,"I like this, and i want to like it more than this review but the bottom line is i feel the speeds could be better for what you are getting/price paid. Its small, sleak, sexy looking. Fits great where i have it in living room but i just feel the speeds should be up. Im running alot of internet devices in the house, not all at once, but im wondering if i should get a upgrade."
2483,This router works extremely well once you get it set up. It took me several days to get the setting right to use it as a repeater. also encryption does not work in repeater mode. otherwise this router would work well by itself.
2484,The KOMPUTERBAY 2GB (2x1GB) DDR SODIMM (200 pin) 333Mhz DDR333 PC2700 LAPTOP did not work in my computer it would not post. I returned it with NO hassle! they provided a prepaid shipping label & refunded the money FAST! I ended up buying Crucial memory that worked first try. I will always buy Crucial memory from now on. I give 5 stars on the ease of returning this!
2485,"At first it seem like it would not fit, but then it worked. I am so glad that I purchased the generic battery versus the name brand one.*Update* The battery recently went out after a month. However, at least it was cheaper. I wish I can find a chargeable battery next time."
2486,"These are the best headphones I've used so far. the sound quality is very good, with great bass and clarity. They are comfortable and do not get caught up in my curly hair like other headphones and are lightweight. I wear them on my commute by bus to work and back (about 1 1/2 hours - 5 days a week) with my MP3 player and they are in my shoulder bag with my other personal items - all day while at work and are sturdy enough to take it.Adding to my review (April 2013) - the headphones only last for 3 to 6 months and then one of the speakers goes out in one ear. I think its because of the way the cable is made. there is a thin short cord attached to one end that shorts out. Ive had to buy 4 of these headsets in the last two years because of this. On the last pair, I tried putting special tape around that little wire but it doesnt stay on so the tape cant protect it and I lost the sound in one ear after 3 months which means losing a lot of the sound since they are stereo headsets. If they would make then different so I can tape the cable to keep it protected they would be great headphones due to the rich bass sound. I put up with it before since the price was 14.00 but now that the price is 24.00 I dont want to spend that much for a head set that will only last for a few months. I changed my rating from 5 to 3 stars."
2487,"This monitor looks great, and is a nice size, the color is pretty good, not great.  The set-up was easy, so that's a definite plus.  On the downside, it creates more heat than I bargained for.  My office is a decent size and if it's on for a while (several hours) the room actually gets warmer.  So, I make sure to turn the monitor off if I'm leaving the room for a while.  The other downside is that I get vertical shadow lines which run all the way through the screen whenever there is a pop-up box on my screen.  Initially I thought it was just associated with my web browser, but then it occurred while I was using the control panel too.  That's a bit disappointing, but I can live with it.Overall, I like the monitor, it was a great price for the size and the two issues are relatively small ones."
2488,"I'm not used to getting so little out of a battery, but for the price this two pack works great. Easy to use/charge and works as described."
2489,"I last reviewed a Magellan GPS over a year ago. I had a number of complaints about it, and just could not recommend it over a Garmin or TomTom even though it had a number of features I really liked. So I was curious to try one of the newer Magellan models and see how it has been improved.Well, you could pretty much take my previous review (found here: [...]) and paste it in for this one. All the things I disliked with that model still apply here. My biggest issues include things like:1. Bare-bones head-up display. The Garmin includes your current speed and local speed limit and then you can customize the other display to show expected arrival time, time to arrival, etc. The Magellan just shows expected arrival. You can tap to popup a display of info like your current speed but there's no way to display it permanently. This is a BIG issue for me, it's absurd to me that I can't have a permanent digital display of my MPH or customize my arrival time to show time to arrival instead if I want. The Magellan text is also quite smaller and harder to read than the Garmin.2. Mount is better than the one before, but it's still very cludgy and difficult to use. It's also rather unintuitive, took me several attempts to even figure it out.3. Startup seems a bit better but still takes way too long.4. Barebones on extra features like bluetooth, extra voices, custom POIs, etc.5. I find the traffic indicator harder to read than Garmin's. They seem similar on accuracy, but the Magellan takes a lot longer to come up. It's estimates for arrival seem to fluctuate a lot. driving with the two next to each other, at the beginning of the trip, the Magellan often is off by 10+ minutes and then gets shorter and closer to the Garmin as I drive. The Garmin is always pretty accurate, although not allowing extra time for things like stoplights. Traffic delays are indicated separately on both.6. The Garmin now has an easy way to jump back to Home from most screens. The Magellan still requires hitting Back - back - back - etc. It's not a major issue, but an annoyance that really should be addressed.7. 3D display is not up to par with others. Also, if you use the map options to change the display there doesn't seem to be any way to go back to 3D, it only gives you 2D options. I had to reset my options to go back.There are some things I do like with the Magellan. It's detour and routing features are much nicer than Garmin. The little chime before a turn is really helpful, I really miss it when I use the Garmin. The lane assist is very nicely done (although it seems to often show extra lanes that aren't there in my area). The screen is bright and clear and the number of POIs is excellent. Saving addresses seems to be fixed from the previous method that gave me fits. I also really like that I can search by zip code rather than having to know the city. If I could take all the things I like from the Magellan and the good parts from the Garmin I could make the perfect GPS, but as it is, the poor heads-up display on this, inaccurate arrival times, lack of extra features, etc. makes this a so-so choice among its competitors."
2490,"I received this product as a gift and out of the package it was in good condition.  The usb slots seem upside-down but that isn't a big deal.  After testing it with the A/V cables the video looked great, but the audio was about half of what you would expect it to be. I had to turn my volume to max to match 50% volume I would normally get.  I figured it was fine, I would just have to turn my volume up.After trying the Component Video cables on another TV, they appeared to not work either.  I got picture, but the entire screen was pink, as if only one or two of the cable actually functioned.  Perhaps this explains the audio problem as well, with only 1 of the 2 audio cables functioning properly.  I don't know whether it is the cables or the device itself that is at-fault, either way it isn't ideal."
2491,"Why isn't something like this is the Nikon box? It is small and the plug on the back makes it very easy to just plug in with no tangled mess of cable.  The car adapter is a plus also for shooting in the field.  The unit does get a litte warm, but not too hot.  Recommend this product and hopefully the Nikon designers take note."
2492,"we ended up just turning it manually. There is a delay when you push the button and then maybe it won't turn at all or maybe it will spin really fast. Otherwise it works great and is about as reliable as you can expect from an antenna (interference, etc)"
2493,"It seems to be well protected with the outside cover. Haven't dropped it yet to find out for sure. The cord that goes from the harddrive to the computer is the shortest cord I've ever seen, maybe just over an inch long. I'm already starting to see a few problems, I think because it is so short, it disconnects all the time. It really needs a longer cord. Other than that, it's small and very portable. The USB is nice since I don't need to plug it in."
2494,"Company A's Kindle lighted leather cover is designed to fit with the latest gen 6"" Kindle and has a nifty feature where your Kindle clips into the cover through wired prongs (will take most users a minute or so to learn) and then the pull out light is powered from the Kindle itself.  All in all this is an attractive and enticing package - the leather folio itself is quite handsome (I like the chocolate colored one) and coupled with the functionality of a built-in light new Kindle owners are hard pressed to skimp out on this $60 addition especially if they often find themselves in locales with dim lighting (airplanes, trains, etc).  While I don't quite suffer from buyer's remorse with the purchase of this cover, based on the final price it's hard to give this product a true 'buy' recommendation to those sitting on the fence for a couple of reasons:1)  The light, while mostly effective, does not illuminate the bottom corners very well.  That said, in a completely darkened room you can still read the entirety of the page but finding the bottom third of the page a tad more difficult to read become very distracting.  Interestingly - if the light was angled back just slightly you do get consistent full page illumination, but the way the light is curved once extended prevents users from adjusting the angle.2)  The cover is heavy.  Almost the weight of the Kindle itself.  When I am at home I often find myself removing the Kindle from the cover and reading it on its own.  Even more so when I am lying in bed with a proper lamp pointed at the screen.  Lying on your back, holding your Kindle in this cover will become quite tiring after several minutes.Still.....this is one handsome and gorgeous cover....with a couple of minor tweaks to the light angle this product would easily be 5 stars."
2495,I got my old worn out laptop back on line for the least amount money making it cost effective. Works.
2496,Not every player will recognize this cleaner head.  I have used it to clean heads but not the one I wanted to clean.It was delivered on time.  good service.  Not really sure if the product really does a good job cleaning.  Everything I used it on worked well before using it and still worked after.
2497,"I bought this system to protect the house from a neighbor who was damaging our property.  It worked...mostly.  In one event, a camera stopped recording motion-based activity for a single 5-minute window that would have caught the neighbor stealing a piece of property from our yard.  That ironic timing doesn't help me like this product any better.  But in the remainder of the events of her efforts to steal or damage our property and home, it was caught on camera and helped us greatly with the police and the courts.Some things to consider:- These cameras are designed for very close range use, such as a covered porch or an entryway.  We are using them to watch the property line.  That means having a camera watch an outdoor line of upwards of 75 feet.  These cameras weren't designed for that.- The camera quality works great to prove nefarious activity occurred but you'll have difficulty identifying an unknown person at anything farther than 5 feet.  But if you know who the perpetrator is or if they are uniquely identifiable, then you can use them for longer range purpose.- The quality of the contrast control is pretty poor.  If you have a heavily shaded/sunny mixed area with a low-mounted view, the image washes out very badly, rendering things virtually useless.- Mounting and connecting is a breeze.- The mounting pedestals have a slightly weak grip and could slip a little.  You need to be careful to not over tighten it to compensate (in order to hold the camera steady).My experience:- I had to send multiple cameras back twice during the 1-year warranty to have them refocused.  I can't say the results have been all that great but it will have to do.- I had to set the DVR to reboot every night in order to make sure certain camera feeds continued to record motion.  Otherwise, some of them would simply stop recording on their own.- The DVR menus are pretty easy to navigate but watching recorded video is MUCH easier from the computer desktop software provided.- Because the DVR had to be installed in an upstairs spare bedroom far from the home internet router, I bought a wireless repeater and am able to stream the video from there to the router.  That lets me watch the video on my desktop, laptop and phone.  This is a HUGE peace of mind while away for extended periods (vacation, road trips, etc.).- The night view with the IR LEDs works pretty well.  When there is snow on the ground, the cameras see as far as they do in daylight.  But there is inconsistent &#34;ghosting&#34; of the lens that I can't answer for.  On some nights, the night view is good.  Other nights, it's as if there is a fog in the air.  Not every camera does it; and those that do it don't do it consistently.Conclusion:While this is by no means an awesome system, it has performed the task needed at the minimum acceptable levels.  For the price, I'm okay with that.  But next time I have to purchase a home security video system, I'm willing to pay more (much more) for higher level of quality and capability.  In the end, I'm glad I spent the money on this unit because it busted our neighbor and sent a clear message of protection.  We're glad to have it, even with its shortcomings and quality issues."
2498,"Im a little surprised at how people are just gushing about how great these are. Yeah they're good for the price but people are comparing them to high end earbuds and thats just crazy. I compared them to my soundmagic e10s which go for around 30 bucks. The panasonic earbuds don't even come close in terms of sound quality. The mids in particular are muddy. The panasonic earbuds will do if you're broke and just can't spend much money. Otherwise do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks on some soundmagic e-10, Jvc Ha-fx67 or MEElectronics CW31. You'll notice a big difference. Obviously, the more costlier earbuds are going to have better, and often multiple drivers."
2499,"Works like a battery.  Not much difference that I could tell between the number of shots with it and the battery that came with my T2i.Update 7/16/13 Battery keeps getting stuck in camera.  I think the battery is expanding, probably time to recycle this one."
2500,"Plug in my son's new Xbox 360... there is a 1-2 sec delay when using the Xbox remote. Switch to the older HDMI cable (also bought from Company ABasics), everything is instantaneous. I returned this one."
2501,"Having a Garmin Nuvi660 for years I was excited about upgrading to the TomTom after hearing great things about them. Well, it has been a love hate experience with me and my new XXL 550.Pros:Big screenAbility to change screen layout, colors and how things are displayedLifetime traffic and map upgradesIQ navigation works wellAsks if I want to use toll roads before planning routeCons:Window mounting bracket and lack of ability to micro-adjust placementUser interface to search for locations (POI)Inability to quickly go to map display once into user interface while searching for locationsUnit does not auto-power off when I turn off my vehicleThe good: The display is HUGE and most of the buttons are easy to select, even with gloves on.  The display is very modifiable, what and how information is displayed. The unit is great at avoiding construction and traffic jams, it will reroute you as necessary and ask you before doing it too. It will also show you which lane to be in and that helps out a lot when traveling or approaching confusing intersections on highways, but it only works when you have a route planned.The bad: Window mount is terrible, hard to adjust and not made for top of window mounting. If you don't know an address or exactly what you are looking for, good luck in finding it, I wanted to find a burger joint close by, but you can't narrow your POI search by type of place only able to pick ""restaurant"". If you are in the middle of a search, but want to quit and go back to the map, you have to hit the back button many times to get back to the map."
2502,protected my ipod from more falls than I can count but the fact that it was so difficult to get in and out of my pocket caused me to loose my ipod because i would leave it out of my pocket for comfort's sake.
2503,"expensive for something that should be included but easier than downloading ,etc."
2504,Easy to install but if you have a big house this might not be for you. It can't connect me in all the rooms and if I have to move about I sometimes lose the signal.
2505,"Some may not enjoy the gloss white material that this case is made with, but I actually like it.  Sure, it looks like a pair of white go-go boots.  I think it's kind of fun.The elastic tabs that hold the case in place aren't all that bad, but I don't see them lasting long-term.  In a year or so, sure, they'll stretch out.  But won't you have purchased another case by then?This case holds your iPad pretty securely, which I was a little surprised by.  I like the zipper-style case that makes getting at your iPad and protecting it just as easy.  The inside pocket is a nice touch, though I haven't really used it.I'm not sure I would purchase this given the chance (it seems a little overpriced to me), but I'm on the hunt for the perfect iPad case... I just haven't found it yet!"
2506,Battery is beginning to show significant signs of memory issues.  Charge life from the get-go was only avg and it's definitely getting worse as time goes on.
2507,"These are not as tough as the company likes to suggest. They have been VERY GOOD at replacing them when they fail due to manufacturing deficiencies. The sound reproduction, unless you are an audiophile that 'imagines' $1500.00 earbuds sound better, is excellent."
2508,The adapter itself works ok but contrary to what the description says there is no rear cap included and they don't reply to emails.
2509,"using the rca to the rear speaker,  my setup is 2 channel to 2 rear speaker and 1 sub woofer, works great but what would make it really nice is if they installed  something that will get rid of the static... its not loud but still annoying."
2510,"I bought this monitor to use in a photo studio, mounted on a light stand, used as a second screen for either a laptop or HD-DSLR video.PROSNo drivers needed with Windows 8VESA 100 hole pattern - perfect for use with grip attachments for mounting on light stands or rails.Completely removable stand, reduces weight and bulk when used on a VESA mountThe image is actually pretty good considering the price, but not as good as my laptop screenUses standard AC cord - no power brick neededIntegrated speakersCONSVery flimsy stand, as others have  noted.  The monitor wobbles on it (one star off for construction)The clear plastic trim is not attractive.No HDMI input - strange for a monitor with speakers.Speakers require separate cable (related to no HDMI)Limited image size and aspect adjustments.Playback directly from my Nikon D800 does not fill the screen properly.  In 16:9 mode, the image looks stretched because it is compressed vertically, with black margins top and bottom that leave 35% of the screen blank.  In 3:4 mde, the image aspect is proper, but is small and has a letterbox."
2511,"Although the Company A listing said the battery fits AT&T SL82558, it doesn't. I had to file down (vertically) the phone's battery compartment due to excessive battery/casing length; we have 5 phones which translate to too much filing. The batteries work but as the saying goes, &#34;size does matter."
2512,"Received unit quickly and looked fine.  Product biggest weakness is requiring two USB ports.  Not good for newer tablets, etc.Required installing driver (Big Problems) Driver was bad for WIN. 7 and crashed my windows program.  Took more than 2 hrs to recover from that.  Ok try again this time let windows install its own driver that went fine but still had to use CD for installing wifi card software. (If no CD player big problem).  Got it installed but no go!  USB cable was defective and would not stay connected just constant beep beep.  Did get to see program open for a second no more.  At this point I decided to return product.  I have multiple devices and this would require installation on each one and too many compatibility issues for me.  I really need a range extender with built in AP and that is what I have moved too. Not the products fault except the 2 USB requirement limits its use."
2513,"I like them, sound is goodthey fit nicely on my headand i dont get headphone hair.I would recommend for workingout at the gym.I use them for walking around townthey easy fit in any bag or pocket."
2514,"These converters do the job, but they're not the greatest you'll find, either.  First, they only hold one battery unlike others that will use the extra room in the D-cell format to hold two AA's for longer life.  Second, they snap together rather roughly and I can imagine them breaking eventually.  Finally, they are a little bit larger than typical cells.  They fit inside everything I've tried but it's a close fit.Overall, they're inexpensive enough and do accomplish their purpose, so they get 3 stars - just order more if they fail.  But there are better ones out there."
2515,"Not sure if anyone else had this, but when I first installed the keyboard a few of the keys wouldn't work, and the ""9"" key was stuck. I managed to get this resolved and it's been functioning good since then. Only complaint is the speaker ""off"" button (function F8) doesn't work. For the money this a good replacement keyboard."
2516,"I got a good deal on this around 500 and something dollars. It is pretty light and this is a good thing because I carry a lot of books around. The screen is great at 14"" and it contributes to the overall portability of the laptop. At the highest brightness, it is almost blinding (which is a good thing). lol. I LOVE the keyboard but the mouse is a whole different story. The click buttons are a bit loud especially when you're in a quiet place like a library. The trackpad can be random sometimes. There are certain gestures that zoom in and out of pages. I am unaware of these gestures and because of that, accidentally placing two fingers on the pad can cause pages to zoom out or scroll to the bottom. It doesn't happen too often but happens enough times for me to notice and can be a pain sometimes. You get to live with it though.Battery life is really great in the first few months. About 4-6 hours depending on usage. Over time it drops to about 2 hours on a single charge. I guess this is normal with most laptops. The one thing I really like about this laptop is the fingerprint reader. You can customize to open certain programs with the swipe of a finger. For example, when I swipe my index finger, it opens up my browser. My middle finger opens up word processor and so on and so forth. I also use the reader to unlock and lock my laptop. Might be a gimmick for some but I find it really useful and cool.Only giving it a 3 out of 5 due to the so-so battery life and trackpad. Other wise a great buy if you can get a good deal on it."
2517,"This antenna works noticeably (but marginally) better than my former RCA antenna.  It's not, by any measure, amazing.I use this as an indoor device and I'm glad I didn't fix it to the wall.  What I'm learning is when it comes to antenna clarity, quality between models happens only in small increments.  The truth is you'll still need to toy with placement of your antenna to get certain channels to come through with less signal drop.Bottom line:  Being realistic about what I can possibly get out of an antenna setup, I've concluded this model is a keeper.  I won't be wasting any more money on fancier models, trying to get better reception out of what's essentially glorified bunny ears and aluminum foil.  Like I said, just don't screw it into the wall or you'll be bummed when it comes time to manually tune."
2518,We haven't had a chance to use this yet.  It's supposed to allow my family to use a headset for both our cordless phone as well as the cell phone.
2519,"It has been already about four days that I have been trying, from time to time, to place this camera, so that I can watch the feed through the Internet away from home. If you do not know much about dynamic ip and such, you will be going to school for a while if you try to do it your self. I have given up because I have a NetGear router model # DNG2200, and the menu to set the camera is not like in the instructions that I have read here, and I hate to call technical support, since the technical support for the NetGear is really poor and frustrating. I will have to call my ISP and go to the EasyN website for support information. However, if any one reading this can help me, that would be great. I am pretty sure that I am not the only one with this type of router.So the only part I could not pass through, is when it states ""before outer access, please refer to your router's user's manual for how to open ports to allow Internet access to the camera."" You have to really know what you are doing here.Okay, I finally manage to connect it to the Internet. Once it is connected, it appears to respond pretty good. So, I have no idea what is the difference between this ip cam and others that are more expensive. When it comes to working, so far I would give it five stars, exempt I do know how long these cameras last without any problems. I guess you could know that from other reviews. I really do not care that the colour is not very close to reality. It is an ip cam; no one is going to use it to take family movies, just for secutity and piece of mind."
2520,"Good news is that it's an inexpensive DVD player that can play commercial DVDs and audio CDs with no issues. So if that's all you want, get it.The only real problem is that some homemade or &#34;homebrewed&#34; DVDs will not work. I read online that this particular Philips model is excellent in reading all sorts of AVIs, but unfortunately that's not always the case. My friend who received this as a gift has around an 85% success rate when it comes to burning DVDs from AVIs. Was hoping for a 100% success rate, or at least 95%. If you want 100%, you're going to have to mess with various compression and conversion software, so good luck with that."
2521,Bought this at Best Buy everything worked for a month was really nice then went to play my Ipod touch I bought at the same timeWon't play says on Ipod accessory incompatable on screen.Chatted with Philips with(there service is outstanding)told to reset ipod did that nothing they are going to send replacement unit out.I did nothing to Ipod or unit We'll see how this works out. Its a great unit when it works sound is outstanding for a small unit
2522,"I ordered these due to several reviews saying they are good headphones. After a couple of months about 3-4, one of the speakers went out. Unfortunately I am not able to leave feedback on wether Sony has a good warranty in place as I did not attempt to get a replacement. They do however sound pretty good when both speakers are working and they stay in place even during a run on the thread mill. If it wasn't for the speaker blowing I would give it 5 stars."
2523,"this really makes the apple charger a little easier when using the full extension cord, however, it increases the size of the charger almost double. as far as keeping this inside a laptop bag, good luck, unless you have a large bag. I found it was easier to store in my backpack without it, keeping the extension separate. keep in mind when buying this, the product dimensions: 2.1 x 5.3 x 5.3 inches. it's a pretty hefty piece to haul around just because of it's size. it weighs almost nothing though."
2524,Works okay as long as you get around the front of the camera and not to far away. A good buy for the money.
2525,I purchased this device when my surface pro wireless was acting up and it did it's job.Pros:-low profile-decent receiving antenna-lightweight driversCons:-Hosted networks are flaky-easy to lose.
2526,"When compared to other USB adapters this is a little low on speed, 36mps vs 54mps for 11g wireless system"
2527,This compact auxiliary cable cord is a good companion cord to have.  It has come in handy when a temp cord was necessary.
2528,"Bought this to play Ipod in car and not have cables all over the place.  The itemns works well, but the quilaity is not great.  The cable is very thin.  I can see that it may not last long.  That said, I only paid $1 for it, so it has already exceeded my expectations.  My wife has a similar product that is made a lot better and it was not much more expensive.  If I was ourchasing again, I would probably opt for a better quality for a couple $'s more.  Also, this items came from China, so it took extra long to receive.  Blows me away that they can even make money on the product with the shipping cposts!"
2529,"Pros:- These headphones look cool.- They seem to be made out of durable plastics.- They are defiantly portable, they fold up and store easily.- The cushions on the ear pieces and headband are nice.Cons:- It has only been three months and the left speaker has already stopped working. The cord is not braided like advertised, it is some sort of thick rubbery plastic... yeah.- The sound is okay, but the range of bass is a joke. I am really disappointing about the lack of bass these things have. I got a Logitech Clearchat headset for my computer at the same time I bought these and they actually have better bass than these things do. And they aren't even meant for listening to music. It's crazy!- Though those padded speakers look like they would be comfortable they are not. Even when I can position them right so they feel okay when I first put them on they still make my ears sore when I wear them for more than 30 mins... which isn't that long for someone who loves music as much as I do. I have to have music almost 24/7 but these just don't work for prolonged listening."
2530,"I am not an 'audiophile,' and cannot tell the difference between a FLAC rip of a CD and a rip at 320kbps, but I do have some mid-range headphones and wanted to see if a portable DAC/amplifier would improve the sound quality. But for full disclosure - I was happy with the sound quality before I bought this item, so my thoughts may be a bit skewed because of my expectations.APPEARANCE/INTERFACE: The device looks nifty and has a clean-looking interface, but I found it a bit difficult to navigate. After using it a couple of weeks, navigation still did not feel intuitive and I was often pressing the wrong buttons. The velourish pouch it comes with its not particularly useful to me as I don't really take the devise with me anywhere. Additionally, if you put it in the rubber case it comes with, it makes it difficult to then put it inside the pouch.SOUND QUALITY: With my Sennheiser HD555's (which I have no problems with and enjoy the sound from), I noticed a slight improvement in sound quality. The mid-range was clearer and overall the sound was more even across the frequencies, which may appeal to some critics of Sennheiser's sound. The improvement was noticeable but not overwhelming by any stretch. The bass boost is probably the most effective feature, and for bassy songs it augments the sound the best.USE WITH EQUIPMENT: I've used it both with my computer's SoundBlaster card and with my iPod. It improves the sound better on the computer than the iPod, but that is probably to be expected given the iPod's weak amp. I've never used it with more high end headphones or high end sound cards, so it is possible I have not experienced its full potential. However if I had more high-end products, I doubt I'd feel the need to use a portable amp/DAC.BATTERY: While I generally use it as a DAC plugged in via USB, the battery life seems sufficient when in use. However when not in use, the battery drains within a few days, and if charging by USB, you must wait about 10-15 minutes for it to charge before you can use it.Given these considerations and the manner in which I use it, I would not buy it again for its price (~$100), as it does not produce a $100 improvement in sound for the hardware I have."
2531,"This is what it is. The one I received is a little loose in any jack I put it into, I bought it to put into the back of my G510, but I can't use it for that because it's far too loose fitting and gets bumped out all the time. Still good to have around."
2532,This one is a little heavy for me with two AA batteries. The scroll is not smooth as my Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000.  The Unifying receiver does not work for me.  I had a Logitech wireless keyboard.  I still have to plug two usb in.  Maybe I have to install software to support that.  I do not like how they claimed in the ads.Not recommended.But it is not that bad.  The receiver distance is good.It might be more suitable for guys not for girls.
2533,Used this for an HTPC about 15 feet from the TV and minor hiccuphs in the signal made it very annoying to use. I took a USB extension cord and placed the receiver closer (around 8 feet) and it works fine now.
2534,"This is a decent lens that is a good pancake size to help reduce the overall camera size.  But I didn't care for the NEX system as a whole.  I thought the camera was combersome and didn't take great photos, so I sold the whole system including this lens."
2535,"I was excited for this product until I noticed the poor craftsmanship/quality. The plastic USB connection housing (at the end of the cord) is flimsy and comes a part easily, just by touching it, thereby exposing the circuit board/internals. While I will probably just tape it together, it would be nice to have things work well out of the box. My order may have just been a defect & yours could be fine, just a heads up for you guys."
2536,"If you want to spend $7 less then direct from jawbone this is for you. I recently had my icon replaced and it came with the new style.. Called Icon Spout, they are $9.99+shipping for there fit kit. Spouts replace the just round ones. The new style makes the speaker louder due to the direct placement in ear channel. I will keep these for backups or if I want  to sell one of my jawbone icons."
2537,"There is no sound while the device is charged.I should have read the reviews before I purchased this charger.Also,  it makes a strange whizzing sound when plugged it."
2538,"It worked fine in my pc while it was above my desk.  Then when I lowered it below my desk and it has awful performance.  I cut the plastic antenna attached to it and learned the antenna wire only went through about a quarter of the antenna.  This is terrible, but it performs ok.  My overall judgement: if you have to buy it it'll probably work but I wouldn't recommend it."
2539,"I'm taking this pen tablet back. It's unfortunate that pen tablets are so expensive. I bought this for Chinese handwriting input. We have an old PenPal Jr. tablet that's Windows 7 compatible, and I *highly* recommend it over VT. However, it can also be more than twice the price -- pretty expensive, imo. In comparison to the smooth easy to use Pen Pal Jr. tablet, I found the VT to feel like writing on a plastic chopping board and the sensitivity of the pen like trying to write with a slippery chopstick.On Windows 8.1, installation of VT was a pain (although this seems to be a problem with quite a few devices, since Windows 8.1 is actually a major OS upgrade even though it doesn't look like one). Rather than install the included drivers, do not install them at all and the pen will work.I'm pretty sure I can learn to use this pen better, but I thankfully don't have to. Try before you buy."
2540,"I actually visited a Mac Store called the Mac Guys in nearby La Crosse and found a short un-useful stubby version of this for an overpriced $29.95. Best Buy which hosts a Mac display had another short video jumper for the Mac Pro, also overpriced, even higher. I use this useful gadget to put computer file videos up on my wall through a Hi Def Projector. HDE, which sold me the six foot article should know that the sheath around the ground of the cable broke open after a month's use, but the ground itself is still solid so it works fine just the same. HDE's performance in getting me this item was first rate. Another Hong Kong based re-seller offered the item slightly cheaper but one was going to have to wait two months for delivery all the way from Hong Kong."
2541,I got it cause i wanted to move my subwoofer in my logitech z623 computer speaker system. On the other side of the room the sub really fills the room.But when i hooked it up it did not work. No Power.Sighs.I tried different cables and it worked just didnt have the length i needed. I thought maybe it was the coupler but using different cables it worked fine.So if its just for your computer monitor it should be fine.
2542,"Well for how cheap this is I can't complain. Driver installation on Windows XP was not fun though. The disc has several drivers on it and gives no hints as to which one works for your model. Mine was luckily the first one I tried out of 3, but since Windows XP wireless functions wouldn't get it to work, I ended up fumbling with it for a good while.Maybe I did something wrong or had an unknown conflict, but eventually I just used the wireless software that came with the product. It is extremely poor, as I have to reconfigure it every time I reboot. Once it is setup it does work, although it is not very fast.Luckily I use this only when I am fixing computers in my basement, and I don't require a reliable high speed connection. If you are using this for your personal or work computer, I would recommend spending more money for a nicer product.  However if you have an application like I do, this is nice since it is so cheap."
2543,"It takes a little effort to pull the three legs apart, and it does not feel terribly steady. In fact it fell the first time."
2544,I tried this on Canon EX 430 ii flash. And it fires once and stops working. I found a walkaround using &#34; DSLRKIT Male to Male M-M FLASH PC Sync Cable Cord with Screw Lock&#34;. Now it fires as long as the flash is ready again to fire.
2545,"This is great for recording music, but is terrible for voice recordings.  There is no pause button during recordings, so you will record a ""file"" and then stop it and it will create a new one.  Great for music, bad for voice.  Excellent sound quality."
2546,"Not too parcel on cowboy studios products, they tend to feel cheap and in my opinion don't last very long... I purchased this to give it a whirl for background fill light and it does what its supposed to do, but the socket assembly where the strobe connects to the mount feel apart in 2 day's, had to fix it myself, hence the 3 start rating."
2547,"Pros: Everything an Android tablet should be, at a bargain price.Cons: It's heavy at almost 2 pounds. Mine had touchscreen registration problems.Other thoughts: Better suited for techies and hackers. This tablet (and many others) are virtually all clones of the same Chinese, Inc. tablets. There's an incredible amount of user support on Tablet Republic, and Iview has a responsive US rep. I flashed it from GB to ICS and back several times. (Iview has an ICS update in beta.) A few easy tweaks gives it stellar battery life and makes it very responsive. I was able to get Swype working on it, too. My problem was that the touchscreen would occasionally register on a completely different point than where I touched. Sometimes it would register even when I hadn't touched it. That was the deal-breaker, but it's well worth the price if you get a good one. Just buy it from Company A so you can easily return if you have to."
2548,I like the headset but the controls are a little bulk and the fact it is for a left handed person was a bit odd.
2549,"I purchased 2 pairs of the TDG-B100 along with the transmitter over a year ago now, and for the most part I've been pretty happy with them.  They are good. strong reliable glasses, with a couple of minor points;1) Battery gets loose - not sure why, but where you unscrew the cap to place the battery in I had to supplement it with a folded piece of paper after a few months.  I put this down to the minor difference in batter dimensions from different vendors, but if you find your pair switching themselves on and off when you touch the frames - this would be a place to start.2) Pretty bad crosstalk - if you're not moving your head much then these again are better than most glasses, however the reality is that mot people move about and you end up with some occasional and annoying ghosting of the image (crosstalk) - just trying turning your head to one side.  I found a post online somewhere with a reference to a Sony KB Article (C1017777), stating that Sony is now making available - free of charge - an additional polarizing filter that can be applied to the existing glasses to eliminate some of this. See: [...]  (if you call Sony customer services tell them it is KB ID: C1017777).Most recently as an experiment, I purchased a pair of the newPlayStation 3 3D Glasses- which aswell as supporting the new Simulview technology, should also reduce crosstalk with inbuilt filters.  I'm happy to report they eliminate all ghosting of imaeges - even with your head turned to obscure angles.  The build quality is no where near as good as the TDG-B100's, but they are also a lot cheaper and would be my choice looking for any other 3d glasses today.Bottom line, if you've already got a pair of these glasses - get the additional free filters from Sony and get rid of the nasty crosstalk.If not, go for a later pair - I highly recommend the Playstation ones as a perfect example of the 'latest technology' with most of the kinks ironed out."
2550,"I loved this product at first but just my luck the screen one day froze on me and I was unable to reset the mp3 player by pressing button and back, Took good care of it so it was no neglect on my end. P.S. JUST BROKE 4 DAYS AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRED, WAHT A BUMMER!"
2551,"Purchased this hard drive(500GB version) for an early 2008 white Macbook. Now, 6 months later it has crashed. Luckily, I had everything that was important backed up to an external hard drive. If that wasn't so, I would be extremely upset. Though the drive ran fine when it worked, crashing within a half year of use is unacceptable. The warranty was filed with Hitachi on their website (this one was good until 2014). MAKE SURE you package your returned hard drive properly as shown on Hitachi's website, or else they won't accept it. This one was packaged as good as an infant in a car seat, and they accepted it. The return was relatively quick. Within a week they shipped a new(possibly refurbished?) hard drive. So now we'll see how long this one lasts. If it crashes this review will be updated."
2552,"These clips have 2 components, a plastic clip for the earbuds, and a rubber over the ear piece. Be warned, these come apart very easily.  In fact, one of them fell off as I was adjusting them on a run.  They're very easy to lose."
2553,"Needed a replacement screen for my HP Pavilion DV6 laptop. It took about an hour to take apart and remove the broken screen, and about 45 mins to drop in this replacement. When I booted it up the first time I noticed 2 dead/stuck pixels right against each other so it looks like a speck of dust is forever on one tiny area - not enough to return but for $50 I wished it was a perfect, new screen - oh well its better than how it was."
2554,"Can't really use for landscapes without a IR modified camera. The wind moves the trees plus the long exposures this camera forces you to use make a big blurry white tree. Otherwise this filter would proabably be better in more experienced hands- IR photography is harder than regular photography, you can't look through the viewfinder or focus. The quality of this filter is a little lagging behind too. The plastic in it feels light and cheap compared to the heavier glass, the quality of the images lags a bit too, the clarity and definition of this filter doesn't match up to my lenses standards. Good first try for IR, maybe i'll gain interest in this later and try it again."
2555,Use on my 50mm f/1.8 on my t3i. great care needs to be used threading this hood on. Seems to stick or cross thread often. when installed it is tricky to tighten up and doesn't feel to secure. Once installed it does what it needs to do.
2556,"It works good, but doesn't charge a phone as fast as I'd like it to. Either way, it's nice haveing a free socket for another car charger plus 2 usbs."
2557,"Got this as a christmas present. Out of the box, the sub would not work at all. But, I am not one of those folks who gives instant 1-star reviews for defective units.Company A would not let us return the product because it is apparently &#34;Hazardous&#34;. We emailed them about it, and they apologized profusely. They refunded us, and didn't even want the lemon set to be sent back. Ordered a second and have just hooked it up. The cable that came with the second set was bad and distorted horribly. Thankfully I have loads of 3.5mm audio cables lying around.THX certification means nothing, really. The sound of these speakers is good. The bass knob is on the right satellite, as well as power, volume, and headphones/ aux input connectors. The sub is awesome, and the sound from the speakers is crisp and room-filling. It's almost like they echo, but not really.Currently using these speakers in conjunction with my Z506 5.1-channel speakers for a 7.1 surround rig (Z623 is the front speakers, while the Z506 handles the center, sides, and rear). If you enjoy bass-heavy sound, this is a great buy, my only caveat is they seem to have a lot of problems. Company A handled the refund quickly and we had the replacement within 36 hours."
2558,"These units work fine but they are WILDLY overpriced.  You can get the same hardware for less than $100 if you buy theUbiquiti Networks PICO2HP 2.4GHz 802.11bg High Power.  It is exactly same hardware. And the Ubiquiti unit has better software.  This unit is configured to act as a mesh hub and must ""phone the mother ship"" every time it boots. It also needs to be configured through the vendor's website. The straight Ubiquiti unit is much easier to configure and generally more flexible.  I see no reason to buy this unit rather than the Ubiquiti one unless you really need the mesh capabilities."
2559,My mother in law got this during a visit and she wanted all of our opinions.  I have to say we were unimpressed it was dull and sound not full.  But after my brother in law turned up the backlighting it was bright and looked like it should.  Conections wise it has all hdmis and one componet input and she had a standard cable box and dvd player so she will have to upgrade one.  As for upgrades Vizio should have more inputs and better preset color settings.  I would get a different model but still like vizio.
2560,photos come out great or terrible there is never any middle ground. kodak has quit supporting this product so the easy share feature has not been updated. i deleted it by accident and its impossible to reinstall.
2561,My previous router (Trendnet TEW-633GR) was purchased 11/2008 and started acting up recently (wireless signal dropping / wired connection unstable). I was constantly power cycling the router to get my connection back up.I decided to replace that router with a Linksys even though this particular model doesn't have external antennas. I don't have any complaints so far.Why would you pay for the new retail one when you can save plenty of money on this refurbished model?--- UPDATE ---This router started having problems and has been replaced. My connection became unreliable and required power cycling the router on a daily basis.Purchase date: 5/12/2012Replace date: 3/26/2013As a result I have lowered my review to 3 stars since it was great while it lasted but didn't last as long as I hoped
2562,"Overall, this camera has great specs, but before you start using it, you have no idea how uncomfortable this little camera can be. First of all, it lacks any good grip curves and it is slippery (meanwhile, it is rather heavy for its size). Secondly, they designed this pop-up flash that is completely automatic and you cannot make it not to pop up every time you power camera up. And the spot where the flash pops up is where you really want to keep your left hand index finger.Even after you update this camera's firmware, the device still goes through batteries like crazy. One day of intermittent shooting could mean up to THREE battery changes.The video shooting mode has some atrocious auto-focus problems. The camera cannot keep up with any moving objects, so they keep being shot out of focus.Also, the wide-angle mode (no zoom) causes some pretty bad fish-eye like results, so if you have to shoot a portrait, you need to step back a little (if you can) and use a bit of zoom - like 2-3x.On the bright side, this camera has wonderful sensor mode settings, great low-light performance, it is rather fast and has tons of zoom power. While its small size can be a bit of disadvantage, but it does not change the fact that the camera is very portable and hardly takes up any space. It feels heavy and reasonably well-built."
2563,"It's cheaply made, but I don't have to move it, so it works for me. I wouldn't advise it for anyone who has to take it apart a lot."
2564,I hate to give this product a bad review but this lamp looks no different then the one I paid $40.00 dollars for! Both made in Mexico! I looked Inside the housing still can't see it! Maybe it's in fine print some where? I'll give it a better review if I get some life out of it!
2565,Literally these things have too much bass and too much treble. No flat frequency response out of these cans. For a $100 I guess they are fine especially for being such small diaphragms. I tend to believe Bose designed them this way to appease to people who think that the more the bass the better the quality. But they had to crank up the treble too much on these to compensate for the extra bass... that's too bad. If your a serious listener and are looking in-ear phones with a well designed sound then you are going to have buy something else like Future Sonics for like $200.
2566,I have had 2 of these break on me. Both times the same problem one of the earpieces stops working randomly. If this did not happen these would probably be the best headphones i have owned but i am not replacing them constantly. Bose needs to make a superior product that does not break the same way every time.
2567,"Meh, this produce is not really useful as a light modifier except for specific situations...Pro: Light and easy to use.Con: Not a great modifier."
2568,"I purchased this so that my wife and I can use it for geocaching.  It seems like a quality device, however, if you are a GPS user, it will probably be fine for you.  I have not used a GPS like this before and my experience is only with the GPS driving app on my phone.  There are some tutorial videos on the Magellan site, but not in enough detail to really help me.  I am still trying to figure out how it works."
2569,"Setting this unit up is simple. Within 5 minutes I was viewing the camera from the monitor. The only problem for me was the range of the device. I understand the frequency it is on may bother some WiFi routers, but I did not notice a difference even when I turned the router off for testing. I set the camera up outside under an eve and the monitor was two rooms away and I could not get a signal. I moved all around the room and did get a partial sync, but it was not good enough to keep the unit. I contacted the manufacturer but they took over a week to reply and by then I already sent it back to Company A. I live in a suburban area filled with WiFi and satellite dishes, so I was not expecting a long range miracle, but I need something more than 20' feet. Once they start using a less crowded spectrum these types of cameras will always have a limit to them. So I am going to use a wired cam for now until the technology gets better."
2570,"Obviously not everyone's ear is shaped the same. Seems like cauliflower ears would work perfect. Good speakers, but i would suggest trying them on first."
2571,Okay but not great. Seem to perform about the same as my old Brookstones. Did not perform as well on a plane (my purpose for purchasing) as the Sennheiser CX 300Bs which I also bought.
2572,"I'm not sure if the problem is that the interface card just can't drive the device through this longer cable, or whether it is the fault of the cable; but, I've been unable to get full USB 3.0 speeds when using this product.  In my case, I'm connecting a Seagate USB 3.0 3TB drive to a Western Digital SuperSpeed USB 3.0 PCI Express card.  I get full speed when using the shorter cable that came with the drive; but, when using this longer cable the speed drops back to USB 2.0 levels."
2573,"See my review on the same pen, but in pink. I don't have much experience with the pen b/c I don't use it often, but for an ipod touch, it's easier to touch the pad with your finger than the pen. Although, it's a nice accessory to have for different apps."
2574,"Being a previous owner and a fan of ER4Ps, the hf3s delivered similar noise isolation, clean & neutral sound that I had expected, with the convenience of a microphone. Unfortunately, the choice of materials was poor and the cables started fraying only after a few months of use. I have since switches to a pair of Ultimate Ears 600VI."
2575,"This camera was fairly easy for me to set up.  Once I got it connected and hooked up where I wanted it the lens was not wide enough.  I read all the reviews before making the purchase but have to tell you the 50mm will not be the best choice for a lot of people.  It would be good high up on a building, otherwise just too close.  This camera is also fairly close to my wireless router but loses the signal a lot, had to purchase separate antenna in anticipation that will work.  Picture is good, software and support is good as well."
2576,The power plug tends to pull out very easily and only two LEDs are working correctly- Others just glow slightly.
2577,I ordered these for my wife to listen to her ebooks/netflix while she sleeps. She was just using plain old earbuds which would fall out or hurt. She says they sound great and are very comfortable to wear. The only problem we've had is that the cable at the mini plug end has broken. The wires have pulled out of the covering and the flexible boot at the end has crumbled. I caught it early and taped it back up with electrical tape and do so again every few months. They still work though and that is what really matters to her.
2578,"Bottom of mouse is not completely flat so when you click either button it sort of wobbles and the cursor can move from what you wanted to click. You have to be deliberate about clicking, it does take more pressure than I'm used to using but maybe it's just not broken in yet. Mouse finish is glossy so it is a little slick to hold onto. It has a lower profile (1"" tall) than our last wireless mouse so it's not comfortable for my husband's bigger hands. Not an ergonomic shape at all.It is what it says - a wireless mouse, and it's working unlike my last one so that's a plus. Really do like the nano receiver, extends out about 1/2""-3/4"" from side of laptop when it's plugged in so I never take it out. All in all, it seems to be a decent mouse so for the $15 price, I'm ok with it."
2579,"The Das Keyboard Model S comes with a hefty price and the expectation of a well-built product that facilitates greater speed, accuracy, and comfort. Highly-skilled typists may feel differently but this above-average typist found the keys to be far too sensitive. Key actuation occurs with the lightest touch at the very first fraction of the keystroke. Keys also seem to actuate inconsistently: a fraction of an instant before or after the click. On the positive side, the Model S has a nice heft, very good stability, undetectable deflection at the bottom of the keystroke, and decent build quality. However, for my needs, the Model S falls just a little short of justifying its premium price and marketing claims."
2580,"For the average user who needs to read various external cards, this product is okay.But for forensic purposes, where a write-blocker must be used, it doesn't work at all. The reader and any cards will not be recognized.This limitation doesn't apply to many people, obviously. But for those, like myself, who would be affected, you've been warned.Jerry"
2581,"This stylus is an average stylus for use on ipad for jotting notes. the tip is rather big, doesnot give the feel of a fine point pen. Downloaded a few apps for writing notes on ipad, so bought this stylus. The reviews seemed good for this product. Used the stylus couple of times.The performance may get better after using/practicing writing with it for a while. But for $15, it's a good buy."
2582,"I had really hoped for more from my S95.  I preferred my Canon SD1000 and SD1100 than I did this unit.  Sure, this has better specs and abilities than those older cameras but those cameras took very quick shots, were great on color recreation, and the flash was able to recycle really quick, you know...the things you _want_ in a P&S; unit.  My S95 has been a disappointment with washed out pictures, hues off, slow response time, and dismal recycle time to take the next shot.My Samsung S3 cellphone takes better pictures than this does!"
2583,"not a bad radio, you have to push on the screen a little hard sometimes to get it to select, and I had two buttons break off within a month or so. user interface not the best. however if you are looking for a cheap option this works good enough for me."
2584,"I needed to replace my dvd and this was a hurry up offense. as a player, they're pretty much all the same. it does have apps built in but I have never set that up. I own 2 roku boxes so that function is covered. great for some people but just one more thing to setup for me. bag it. what I do not like at all is the remote. on the 3 months I've owned it (and it largely doesn't get turned on often) I can't count how many times I've hit the wrong button. it's beyond annoying to want to rewind a few secs for something and it's the back chapter or vise versa. you constantly hit the wrong button in the dark because it's poor layout. good chance this thing will be on craig's list very soon because I'm getting tired of it. I *would not* recommend this to anyone"
2585,"There are lots of these litle &#34;Essential Kits&#34; available, and most of them have a couple nice lens accessories and then tons of cheap cleaning pens/cloths etcetera.I bought this for the set of filters and for the fisheye and telephoto adapters.The fisheye adapter works really well, but you definitely lose at least one f-stop, and on the 18-55 EFS Canon Kit lens, you have serious vignetting when at 18mm focal length. Now, obviously this cheap little lens is going to give you a lot of distortion, and you might want that for artistic affect, but it can be a little obnoxious if that's not specifically what you're going for (I like it, though, and at this price it works in a pinch).The 2.2x telephoto adapter, however, is AWFUL. On every lens I've tried, there is a fogginess/blurriness across the center of the image. The higher the focal length, the worse it is. It's completely useless.This kit is a great buy if you get a working 2.2x telephoto adapter, and it's okay considering the little plastic diffusers and lenses and the decent fisheye adapter, but I would advise against ever buying Vivitar telephoto adapters.Pros..price.nice variety of lenses and adapters.fisheye adapter works wellCons..fisheye adapter loses more than one f-stop.2.2x Vivitar telephoto adapter is useless"
2586,"I purchased the Garmin because I was tired of paying for my Droid's $30/month data package, but I still wanted GPS with traffic.The Garmin is better than the Droid in a few of ways:1)  Data service for traffic is free.  (Very nice)2)  The Garmin shows you which lane to be in at highway interchanges. This is a really nice feature, so that you have time to get in the proper lane.3)  Reception:  The Garmin works better in remote areas.The Garmin is worse than the Droid in the following ways:1)  The Garmin's touch screen is much less intuitive/friendly2)  The Droid allows voice commands, so you don't have to type in an address.  This is especially nice if you are already driving.3)  You can tell the Droid a location (e.g., Jack Rabbit Slim's) that you don't know the address for, and it will find the address for you.  Then, with the touch of a button, it will start directing you there.4)  The Garmin doesn't show you the overview of the course it is taking you on as clearly as the Droid.  On my Droid, I could easily see a topographical view of the course the Droid was taking me on, as well as alternatives.  The Garmin doesn't offer this functionality.  I prefer the Droid's functionality regarding this item, because I can get a better sense of whether the route is correct (as we know, these machines make mistakes at times).I would much prefer the Garmin if it allowed voice commands, and if it had a better course overview.  As it, it just depends on how important the data package cost is to you."
2587,"Garmin Nuvi 1490LMT...great thing about this gps hardware is that it's lifetime free maps and traffic. I've had one GPS before this one and I have never had any issues with it. I loved my first one. I figured this is a better GPS since the screen is wider and it has more informative screen than the older versions...I loved it really until one week after using it I tried not connecting it to the 12 volt adaptor where it should be giving me at least a few hours of usage but this is not true. only after 10 minutes it gives me a message that the battery is low. I've had this gps for a few years now thinking that when I tried it without the adaptor it might work if fully re-charged. Not really great since there was no change. Battery dies fast within a few minutes so you just need to keep it plugged in all the time.second is that this keeps re-booting now. I don't understand what's wrong with it why it keeps rebooting. I update the system  every week so why does it still re-boot? I don't know if anyone knows hot to fix that.Third. why does it seem like that there are still roads that have been developed or changed for a few years now and still the system still does not recognize closed streets, newly built roads and newly developed homes that have been built for more than 5 years now.I'd like to know too if there's a way to replace the re-chargable battery built in the device. Can this be done?"
2588,"I have owned several previous Nikons (the last was a D80) and the image quality of the D3100 is excellent with both kit lenses. However, never having used Nikons for video before, I find the D3100 disappointing. Auto-focus in a wide range of situations is unacceptable and I have obtained better quality (through my HDTV) from my Canon and Lumix point-and-shoots.The battery life could be improved and I have had to recharge mine frequently after about 250 shots (no videos).That Nikon dispensed with the electric eye for remote control is also disappointing.I wish I'd kept the D80 !"
2589,The support does the job well but for a price. I believe it is way over priced at $16 each.
2590,"I bought this model for my wife for Christmas 6 months ago.  It worked fine until this week now none of my three computers will recognize the device, it will not turn on nor will the battery charge.  I even tried putting three new AAA batteries in it and it still would not turn on.  I chatted with Cisco customer support and they said it was still under warranty but just when the support person was going to tell me how to RMA it, he said his manager recommended I talk to another area to try more ""work-arounds""...please.  After trying it on three computers I think is dead.  $175 down the drain.  Look elsewhere.  I am not the only one with this issue either....lots of others.Update...have to bump this up to 3 stars...I contacted Cisco and after a bit of a run around, I was able to RMA it and they delivered an apparently brand new replacement.  Very nice job on their part!"
2591,"I've owned both FlipHD and MinoHD to give you some in-depth review on what's better and how to reset your dead MinoHD (towards the bottom).  In contrast, Flip & Mino both are identical in terms of video quality and functionality.  Comparing the two I came with these comparisons.Build Quality = TiedFlip feels like a cheap plastic toy while the Mino has a solid metal casing that's slimmer than it's plastic sibling.  Flip on the other hand has a solid feel because of it's bigger size that have more surface for your hand to grip.  Flip isn't a unit you can put in your pocket and walk around.  It's a bit bulky and you'll either hold it in your hand or putting it elsewhere travelling.  Mino of course fits like a cell phone.  Slim, slick but also the small sized body means you can easily drop it.  The all around slick surface also doubles the chances of dropping and scratching the unit.Button Interface = TiedMenus and functions are identical including the button design.  The only major differences are that Flip has physical buttons that you can feel pressing.  Some people like that over Mino's touch sensitive surface but without any mechanical buttons.  I felt as though the mechanical buttons were more realistic and feel like Mino's touch sensitive surface doesn't respond at times or unpredictable.  It's a weird surface getting used to in the beginning.  It's definitely a slick design that compliment Mino's overall design but some people may not like that.Battery Charging = Flip winsFlip HD although can be charged with it's USB port like the Mino, it comes with rechargeable batteries (which is really two double rechargeable AA's).  That means you can take other rechargeables and stick them in if the battery runs out during the two hour recording.  Mino on the other hand can only be charged via the USB port.  It takes much longer to recharge in full and if you're travelling that can be a bad thing.  Also, the two hour recording time is only if you were to just record full two hours of video in one shot.  Otherwise, stopping, recording, reviewing and everything you do while the unit is on eats the battery much quicker.Video Quality = Mino winsMino seems to have a tad bit better contrast including slightly better low-light recording.  Though grainy and unlike any professional video records, Mino seem to do fairly well.  But not to put the Flip down, they both are great HD camcorder for its price.  I also noticed Mino has a wider angle lens compared to the Flip.  That might be a good advantage over Flip.Video to PCBecause two hours of HD means large file size, you'll want a USB2 port on your computer or laptop.  8GB is quite the size to work with so if you have an older computer, I probably would make sure your computer can handle processing HD movies.  My older Windows XP machine took nearly 30 minutes to download the entire 8GB videos (and not sure if it's actually USB2 on the port I used).Overall ImpressionAs long as the unit doesn't die it's a decent camcorder.  BUT with today's smart phones having much better camera quality you may be paying a lot more.  Unless you don't want to spend $400+ on a new phone and have a chance to buy a standalone camcorder like a Flip for under $100 it may be worth the cost.Mino HD Death & Reviving the UnitThis information was taken from various sites including YouTube where I was able to resurrect my Mino HD that died few months back and finally was able to restart it.  These things just decide to call it quits from time to time apparently.  All you need to do and what worked for me is this:1. Look under the Mino HD's unit where the tripod mount is and locate a small hole2. Take a paper clip or something smaller like a needle and push down the RESET button3. Push the RESET button for 7 seconds, then repeat it three to four times4. Plug the camcorder in the USB port of the computer/laptop and let it SIT THERE.5. Let it sit there for couple hours until the screen comes on.6. Don't touch it.  Just let it sit until it's fully charged.7. It may not do anything for the first 10 minutes but you'll see the steady red charge light8. Mine took full couple hours but the LCD screen eventually came on!I ended up losing all of the videos (I think there were few clip) but at least my Mino HD is back to life.  I hope this works for you.  It's an annoyance for sure but I've been wanting to record again so this gives me another chance :)"
2592,"It looks very similar to the white OEM model cable but its build quality is very poor.  When I inserted the cable in my iPhone, it works! But once I pulled it out, the plastic case of the cable separated (broke).  I was able to snap the piece together but this happens about 1/3 times.  When you pull the cable out of your ipod/iphone you have to squeeze the head of the connector very very tight so that it won't break while pulling."
2593,"I've purchased this unit so that movies, TV recording and music can be accessed when my PC is off. I have a desktop PC with 900W power supply so just to stream music or movie; it really isn't all that economical. Initially, I setup this NAS with two 500GB SATAII HDD under RAID 0 since that usually gives the fastest data access speed both read and write. Both HDD were 7200RPM version with 16MB disk cache and during file transfer to NAS, it was averaging about 11   Within PC HDD transfer, it averages about   so it was much slower.Case design: It is better than average considering the price is less than $100 and internal HDD bay is well made with side plastic rails to secure the HDD.Front LED indicator: It is easy to identify the status of NAS and condition of HDD with LED indicator even when it is remotely located, the current status can be identified.S/W: The setup is easy and web access is better than the most NAS I've seen or used at this price point. The backup S/W is not good but it is free so no complaints. Firmware upgrade was easy.Speed: I've upgraded with 2TB x 2 HDD with RAID 0 setup and transferred 1.4 TB of data where each file cluster was between 800MB - 1.4 GB in size. The transfer speed was 10.3   sec and it took about 40 hours to complete. This unit is very, very slow so if you want to transfer data between NAS and PC frequently, forget this unit.DLNA 1.5: All of my DLNA units found this NAS without a problem so works well.RAID setup: It has a good flexibility where you can set RAID 0 or 1, and JBOD if you have different HDD size but want to combine HDDs.Multiple user access: When two or more users are accessing NAS at the same time and if this unit is connected to wireless router (Dual N-protocol) it will have an occasional drop outs. I have RJ-45 Ethernet jack throughout home with 1-Gbit LAN switches and three users using NAS caused the frame to drop.Conclusion: If you are spending money to purchase two new HDD and this NAS case for media streaming purpose, I would recommend spend more and get a faster version NAS case. If you already have some spare HDDs and want to combine them for larger storage for file access for sharing and occasional movie or music streaming, this unit is a great buy. For accessing office files or MP3 files, this is fast enough and you'll be happy with this unit.10/5/11 UPDATE: Data transfer rate question.I have my desktop PC in my home office where there is 1Gb LAN switch and initially the NAS was connected to this 1Gbit switch where data transfer rate was around 11 MB/s. Now it has found a permanent location which is hidden inside of a book case in a den which is connected to a different 1Gb LAN switch connecting all RJ-45 LAN outlets where switch is inside the home security panel. This separate in-house LAN switch is connected to my office switch and speed is even lower when I transfer. It now reads about 10 MB/sec when I transfer files. Which is understandable due latency and traffic management of switch is added to the transfer overhead."
2594,"I cut out my cable last Fall, and after searching for something to supplement my over-the-air television I went with a Roku XDS. I had looked at the Revue, and it seemed very promising, but I was not willing to swallow the $299 price tag.In almost a year of using my Roku, I have since purchased a WD Live Plus and a new Roku 2 XS. Because of the WD, I ripped all my DVDs into ISO format, but found it's interface and tiny remote a real pain. The Rokus are great internet streamers, but have a very limited set of codec support. So when the Revue dropped to $99 I figured I'd give it a try.. Make no mistake if you are looking to buy this that it is a device really meant to be a ""companion"" to your cable TV. If you have OTA television via an HDTV with a digital tuner, or a non-hdmi enabled tuner box there will be no integration of the Revue and your broadcast television.The first thing I found was that using a keyboard as a controller is rather awkward rather than using a remote. Obviously for something like this with a web browser, a keyboard is really a necessity though. It did however make it very easy to control my television via the keyboard, so at least I didn't have to have a keyboard and various remotes too.For local playback, I was disheartened to see that although the unit is Flash capable, it is very limited in codec support as well. It will not play all my DVD ISO files, to get the files to play I would have to re-encode them all to MP4 for example. I have done that for alot of them already to play through my Rokus, so it's not a huge issue, but I expected a device that was original $300 to at least be able to some things *much* better than a unit who's base model costs $59. The interface of the file browser is just very basic, and didn't even show the thumbnails for my movies like the WD and the Roku do, just a list of files.The overall interface is impressive to look at, but everything is more of a pain to navigate to and through. Many of the ""apps"" are put together differently, so some require pointing a clicking through this and that, then hitting ""F"" for full screen, and others can only be navigated using the directional pad on the keyboard. I found it to be slightly annoying to have to figure out how to navigate each individual app I tried. Roku on the other hand is basically the same type of navigation through every channel so there's much less ""figuring it out"".As far as apps, pretty much what I saw as offered were either duplicates of what I had already on other devices, or things that I really didn't care about anyway. The ones that were on there like Netflix, AVOD, and Crackle took many more clicks and touchpad moves to select what I wanted to watch as compared to the Roku units.The Company A VoD ""app"" basically is just a link to that section on Company A's site and requires you to first search the site (as you would on a computer) to find something, say that's is free to you as a prime member. Then you must click click click down the webpage, use the touchpad to select something, use the touchpad again to select play, then once it plays use the touchpad to get over to the ""maximize"" button on the player itself.The browser is cool along with being flash-enabled but found it's usefulness to not really be astounding. Yes, I can surf to my isp's website to log in and check my mail, but in the amount of time all that takes I can just hit the envelope icon on my iPhone and have my mail before I can even get the password typed in on the webpage. The flash ability is kind of a wash because anything you actually *want* to watch is blocked by the provider. CBS's TV.com and of course Hulu.com (there's no Hulu + currently available either) are big ones. There are a few sites out there that are conglomerations of content that work, but really it's a pain to navigate through these sites just to find something to watch. Then as I found, after the program is over it's a clumsy process of backing out just to find the next episode and get it to play in fullscreen again. Although I guess if you love internet porn the browser may be quite worth the effort...Youtube works on it but I really didn't mess with it much because I am used to the simplicity of it on my Roku units. Currently there is no official Youtube channel on the Roku, but Roku has stated that one is coming. I was fortunate enough to have had the private Youtube channel installed before Google forced Roku to stop access to it being installed.Now I know that Google is pinning together a version of Honeycomb for the Revue and supposedly bringing a limited app store. I honestly don't have real high hopes for a ported version of Android drastically changing how I feel about actual usability of the device. Google fans will no doubt flame me for this but I have never been too impressed with their Android incarnations so to me that's not a big selling point.Overall, for me it's really just ""mehhh"".. It takes so much effort to find and play the things than that with the devices I currently have. The flash browser doesn't really make alot of difference to me because as I said, the good things are blocked. Ease of use is a biggy as well. The Roku units are very simple to use, and so simple to use I've purchased a few for my elderly parents. They now enjoy very much watching content from Netflix, Crackle, HGTV, AVOD, Internation News channels like RT, BBC Worldnews, Al Jazeera, and all the other streaming choices. I thought about giving them my Revue but quickly realized the confusion that would ensue would keep me on the phone with them doing tech support non-stop.With my streaming units, I want to spend my time watching things, not ""looking"" for things to watch and figuring out how to get there lol. BUT if you are a tinkerer or just a gadget-lover, or someone who wants the (almost) no limitations on what internet content you can see on TV but doesn't want a full-blown HTPC, this can be a great device. As someone who enjoys easily finding something to watch...and watching it..with tons of streaming choices and a bit of local playback too, there are better devices out there for you.I now have found that my USB ports on the unit are no longer working and in speaking with CS they have advised me that the unit is faulty so I'll be returning it for refund."
2595,"These definitely stay in your ears, and you barely notice they're there. My only complaint is that the audio quality really isn't what I had hoped for this price."
2596,"I gave this rating simply because there is a little bit of deception between the picture and the actual product received. Approximately 12 inches down/away from where the cable plugs into the Gateway, there is a 1&#34;X1.5&#34;X2&#34; fuse box that is missing from the picture. The product works as described, installation is easy, however, I do believe that if one is going to make a profit from selling this docking cable he or she should at least display an accurate picture of the product."
2597,"The monopod is not bad,coming from vivitar,it is built not bad.How well it lasts after use is a good question.Time will tell."
2598,"Nice small size but it takes forever to load it up with music. The little tether cord that it comes with is difficult to lace into the small holes (the cap keeper holes) Finally got it with a pair of tweezers and a safety pin. The packaging is a little odd. My roommate opened her package up with scissors and ended up cutting her tether in half, not knowing that it was hidden in the back of the package."
2599,"Just a FYI for any one else.... This is USB 3.0 so I figured it would be good for USB 2.0 also...... Says compatabile but well it has taken over 20 hours to copy 189.9 GB (one directory of 1200 files) to the drive (new nothing else on it) from a Core 2 duo 2.26 MacBook Pro. It take less than 13 hours to do a complete disk copy of my entire Drive (750GB WD drive, 507GB used) to a ITB  WD drive drive in a open enclosure. I'd wait and see how it works with a 3.0 USB port before I'd buy another. It is nice and compact with a one USB connection cable, and it is WD so should be reliable. This is the slowest USB SATA drive I have ever used. This will not become my replacement for the open enclosure USB backup set up I have. May be just my setup so checkout other reviews before you decide. BTW the 189GB directory is also copied when I do the complete disk copy, my backups are 100% recopy, old school habits die hard."
2600,"I wanted it to mirror my NAS, so it wasn't what I was looking for.  Seemed to be perfect if you wanted a mirror of you computer."
2601,"Did not really need this, but was advised on the web site as most people bought this with the camera. It is just a little longer cord, than the one that comes free with the camera, so not really necessary."
2602,"Normally, a flash drive simple works, and there isn't much to say about it. The problem with this drive is the cover over the plug end. The cover doesn't lock into place, but rotates freely around the connector. As a 'permanently' attached device its fine, but if you plan on using the drive for transporting files, get a different drive where the cover locks in place."
2603,"Before you do anything else with this 16GB USB drive, format it as a NTFS partition. That erases the annoying RED logo that's displayed in Windows Explorer, and who knows what else! But I've purchased three 32GB Kingston USB drives in the GT101 G2 series without this annoyance, and like the hinged cover & small size."
2604,"Used it to create a recovery USB with my recovery drive loaded on to it also for a asus vivotab smart me400c tablet.The recovery drive was alittle less than 7.8gb and the recovery system was only about 2 mb so I wasn't sure this 8gb USb flash drive would work. Mostly what I read or watched on YouTube said to use a 16gb usb but I had this 8gb usb and said what the heck, try it. 15 minutes passes and it was still not finished copying the files, another 15 minutes passes and now I wondering if the usb flash drive is good at all. well, after another 20 minutes, my tablet said it successfully created the usb recovery drive. It took 50 minutes to write it. TG I only need it to write once. This usb flash drive is slow, about 2.66bps. The good thing was that I was able to use a 8gb stick instead of a 16gb stick and saved me a few bucks."
2605,"not very remarkable device, slow write times (I'm spoiled by ocz, perhaps).I was attracted to the built in cover, but that proved disappointing--the unit flexes about the fulcrum point so much, the insert is exposed.I wouldn't buy again.tlt-"
2606,"I bought on sale and couldnt go wrong for the memory and the price. It has a snazzy flip cover, feel like Jack Bauer. The flash drive does come preinstalled with a bunch of software, which I promptly deleted."
2607,very slow upload rate on my macOS 10.7. I wouldn't be surprised if apple was limiting it so it could promote Thunderbolt though.
2608,"This camera has a very good zoom lens however the compromise seems to be (particularly in the 'auto' mode) image sharpness. When photographing distant objects, objects in the foreground tend to be out of focus but with  customized settings careful framing and some post-production this can be overcome.All things considered a good camera."
2609,"I am unsure exactly what the issue is.  Ever since installing this software I get the blue screen of death and my computer reboots.  it seems to work fine if I uninstall, but I am not sure.  It doesnt' happen regularly so very hard to say this is the cause."
2610,Fit is reasonable for the money but not as secure as factory stock.Fine on lower dollar components but be careful with high-dollar equipment.
2611,"Awesome for gaming, watching movies, to get that extra bass boost in your music. If you like your bass loud in your car this might be the dealiow.Now if you're into music production, video editing, want to listen music as they where intended to be listened keep on searching, these are not for you."
2612,"I bought this set of phones to replace a set of Panasonic cordless phones with earlier technology (I was concerned about WiFi interference on the earlier phones).I've been diappointed in the range compared to the earlier phones.  The base station is in our master bedroom, and the phone on my desk (2 floors down, other side of the house) will not maintain a good connection.  Callers on the other end complain about static and broken conversations.  This was not the case with the earlier Panasonics.I re-configured my phone with the old system base station on my desk and the other phones spread around the lower and middle floors, and the new system (KX-TG9322T) all on the same floor of the house.  They work (unremarkabley) well, but I miss having the intercom feature that connects all three levels of the house."
2613,"I got this as I read it supported MKV, m2ts, mpg, and other. It also is DLNA and supports streaming. All true, but not in combination. It will not stream any video format I can find. Forums indicate Sony disables it. Off a USB Thumb drive it plays 1080P with rich audio perfectly, and has a great Internet selection of content to pick from (thus the 2 stars). If you want a Home DLNA that steams 1080P formats look elsewhere."
2614,"The 2010 version of Bloggie feels like another half-baked effort from Sony, a company that seems unable to pull itself from a creative and engineering slump that has lasted almost a decade. What a pity, because the physical Bloggie looks beautiful and feels great (albeit a bit heftier than I'd have preferred). What a pity, too, because its HD recording modes are excellent.Even in low light conditions, the HD video usually comes out bright and clear. The three HD modes -- 1080/30, 720/60 and 720/30 -- all look good; I usually shoot at 720/60 for the silky smoothness.Still images come out okay, but the Bloggie suffers from terrible shutter lag, even more so than my lowly cell phone.It's the interface that makes me wonder what kind of dumb people work at Sony. These people have absolutely no common sense -- okay, I should mention the possibility that maybe this was designed in Japan where people tend to use electronics differently than we here (or so I've read in newspaper reports). Seems they didn't hire a couple of real American testers to test the UI. The buttons are uncomfortable to use after five minutes. It shoots, get this, vertical videos! (I imagine some bloggers could use vertical-shaped video clips, but at least Sony should have made this a user setting.) The touchscreen is even less responsive than the latest ipod touch or iphone. And sometimes you have no idea where all those icons have disappeared. Just dumb.I still carry the Bloggie in my pants every day and use it to record my daily ennui. But it could have so much better. For ths price, too, Sony should have added wi-fi capability. But then, it's Sony, and to them form is always usually more important than function."
2615,"Not near what I'd hoped it would be, but it works. The picture is pretty fuzzy. Should have spent more and purchased a better one."
2616,"First issue:  The unit has three different input jacks.  Periodically, when I operate my cable remote, another input channel (e.g. 2) is randomly selected - seemingly for no reason.  This kills the audio.  Then I have to reach for the Polk remote to re-select the correct input channel (e.g. 1) to get the audio back.Second Issue: Wireless subs are good in theory, but this one periodically stops working and has to be re-synched.  They should provide a wire connect option, since those simply work.  Also, a cheap plastic ""cabinet"" has no real place in a sub (that's what MDF Board is for) and the rubber legs  on this one aren't tall enough to clear my carpet.  I had to purchase and cut a sheet of 1/4"" plastic to place under the sub's stubby feet in order to prevent the woofer from contacting the rug.  That's just sad.)Third issue:  Turn the unit ""off"" and the sound-bar indicator lamp goes from green to red (to indicate ""off"") as it should.  But the sub-woofer's indicator lamp keeps  flashing green for at least 5 minutes because it's ""searching"" for the bar - as it would during the initial set-up.  That light eventually turns to solid red.  In other words, my living room looks like a fun-house after I shut this down, turn out the room lights and go to bed.  This is just plain stupid on the part of the engineers who designed this.  Now that I think of it, there are way too many lights on this thing...blue, green, red, flashing green, flashing red...My $2,000 SVS home speakers don't have any lights on them at all, yet they sound FANTASTIC.Fourth issue: I had to call Polk to get my cable provider's remote to work with this, since the provided instructions were woefully lacking. (The good news is that I got a rep quickly and he was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful - a rarity in these times.)  Most people will not be able to get their cable remotes working with this unit without experiencing major pain.Fifth issue:  My cat's whiskers are thicker than the skimpy optical cable that's provided with this.  Go buy a real optical cable.  BUT, if you do be prepared - the unit will tip (from back to front) due to the close proximity of the cable to whatever you set the unit on.  I had two 3"" tall plastic spool ""feet"" made up by a machinist friend of mine to get around this problem.Sixth issue:  Be ready to invest 1/2 an hour or so in properly removing (and cursing) the huge product information sticker that Polk sticks on the front grill.  They specified a cheap adhesive (to save perhaps 1/2 cent per unit), so be prepared for a mess.  I used Goo Gone (citrus based cleaner), a toothbrush and a rag to clean mine.Summarily, this is basically a decent sounding unit for the money, but it's also a pain in the a** in many respect because Polk didn't bother to fully engineer this product.UPDATE 2/25/12:  The unit stopped working 9 days ago.  I'm lucky enough to have a good dealer (privately owned) and they ordered me a new one, which I got today."
2617,These headphones are great for running.  They even work with normal glasses or sunglasses.  After a few long runs with these headphones I barely have to adjust them.  The only complaint is the sound quality.  The quality is pretty lacking compared to the more expensive earbuds I have.  But for the cost it's well worth it.
2618,"I uploaded some pictures to show how reflective this television is.Upon receiving this television, I found the box to be thin and unbalanced.  Felt as if it could easily fall over if bumped, so if you have kids or pets around when unboxing you should be extremely careful.My first impression of this television was that it looked like a dark mirror.  The amount of reflection is crazy.  I have two LCD televisions (37"" Westinghouse and 52"" Sony) that have a matte finish and there is very little glare/reflections on those.  The reflection was beyond distracting.If you purchase this television and want to view 3D content right away then you need to either get a bundle with the glasses or purchase the FPT-AGO1U Real D 3D glasses from Toshiba.  They currently cost about $86 to $120 per pair.  You will not be utilizing 3D much, if ever, if you don't have enough glasses for everyone.The built-in speakers are good for a flat screen, but I use and recommend a receiver and speakers.  If you do not have a speaker system, then these will be adequate until you do.Picture Quality - The picture is good as long as you are in a dark room (to avoid reflections) and can get past the clouding issues.  You need to tweak the settings out of the box due to the soap opera effect (Turn ClearFrame 120 off!)  The clouding is bad.  I see clouding in all quadrants of this tv during dard scenes, especially the lower right quadrant.  This television uses Edge-Lit LED technology and it really does make the lighting in the entire picture change especially in dark scenes, in a negative way.The 3D is very good.  I have tested this tv with 3D trailers on VUDU, 3D videos on my PS3, and 3D games on my PS3.  I did see some ghosting, but it either goes away after the tv warms up or I stop noticing it.  The biggest negative about the 3D is the need for glasses, and these are HUGE glasses (but comfortable enough to watch a movie).  Obviously, your 3D milage may vary since there is limitted content and if you don't have enough glasses for everyone watching then you won't be using it.Another thing that bothered me with this tv was the lack of component connections.  It does have 4 hdmi connectors, but I do have a some game systems (Wii, Xbox, PS2) that I need to be able to connect via component cables.  I can only connect ONE item at a time via component cables to this television without a switch or a receiver.It also only has an optical output for audio (which is nice to have), but to connect it to my computer I need regular stereo rca output.  My other televisions have both.I was impressed with the wireless connectivity.  I am able to stream Netflix and HD content via VUDU without a problem over my wireless network and it looks great.  As of this review, it unfortunately does not have Hulu nor Company A On Demand apps.  The Netflix is a basic interface and not the most efficient to use (also you cannot change television settings while in Netflix for some reason).In short, I would not pay $1,500 for this television.  After a month, I decided to move this television into the bedroom and bring the 52"" Sony LCD back into the living room...mostly due to the reflection and missing Company A on Demand.  If you have any questions about this television, please post them here and I'll be happy to answer them."
2619,"The wall charger does not work. Other than that, I think the collection is pretty good for the amount spent."
2620,"My first Medialink Wireless N router did not work properly. I had just switched to Fiber Optics at 30 mbps, and I was getting that directly out of the outlet, but through the router, it was coming in at 1 mbps or less (even worse than my DSL service!). I was having major buyer's regret ... which I didn't expect, because this item had so many 5 star reviews on Company A! Then, for no apparent reason, it worked for a couple days ... but after that, it choked the bandwidth again. After some time troubleshooting with Mediabridge, it was determined that the unit was likely defective. I received a new one and shipped back the old one. The new one works fine out of the box. The directions, which I had scoured six ways to Saturday on the first one, worked the first time on the second router.The blue lights are a little bright, and they point right at you, but I can live with it (or get out some electrical tape!). Range seems OK but video download speed seemed to drop off precipitously with distance inside my house ... even more than my old b/g router. However, that could be from the wireless N usb adapter I had to use to connect my laptop at all (the laptop's internal Atheros card worked with the old b/g router but not this Medialink one).One benefit that cannot be underestimated is that, as many have noted here, is that the tech support (Jarrod Coburn and others at MediaBridge products) is excellent. They appear to be U.S. based, with no language difficulty, no scripting, friendly, helpful, competent, and they actually call you back. I have to say, I haven't had that level of tech support/customer service for an electronic item since the late 1980s when I bought my first Midnight computer. It was quite a throwback. Perhaps the future augurs well for MediaBridge.I want to give it 4 stars, but I had more than one problem, so a 3 seems more appropriate. It wasn't just that my first one was defective, my laptop would not connect with it at all, requiring me to buy a wireless N USB network adapter to get it back to its prior functionality. Even then it is sometimes slower than before. Trying to put forth a nuanced review. I'd say the entire experience has been a 3, with the best parts being 5-star tech support/customer service, 5-star ease of setup (only counting second router - first one was a fail) + quick delivery.I would buy another if I had to do it over again. I think I was merely unlucky, and even then, the company made things right, without a fight. That's too rare these days."
2621,"I'd complained about GoFlex eSATA wire not working. But I tested GoFlex 1.5TB with eSATA cable yesterday. The cable worked within 10GB data transfer and costing around 4 mins. On the other hand, 1TB GoFlex would get stuck on around 5GB transfer. So, this product may not compatible with eSATA cable.Anyone who doesn't have USB 3.0 ports isn't a suitable customer to buy this product. The one whose computer has only USB2.0 is better to buy USB2.0 GoFlex. Or, maybe don't buy this product and GoFlex eSATA cable and want to use these two products together."
2622,i believe in quality products but i will give this away for a present and continue to use my 1990 philips cd-40 player. the DAC chip makes the philips cd player sound so impressive. and of course back then the quality was so much better. i should of known not to buy a new cd player.
2623,"I was just getting into Amateur radio.  I had an HT with an antenna in the car.  Even with a speaker/mic on the radio, it was not convenient and I had some problems hitting repeaters 8 miles away.I looked at the reviews and picked this low cost antenna.  It boosted my signal and I was able to get some more range on the HT (4 watts).  SWR was running at 1.4:1 on UHF and 1.2 on VHF.  Not bad.Latter on I tried a real base loaded dual band antenna (the Tram antenna is just a straight piece of steel with a pig tail twist in the middle).  The base load antenna made a bigger difference when I ran it against the Tram in a side by side test.  The Larsen dual band made a 4 db gain on UHF over the Tram to the stations I was testing with.  The Larsen was 5 times the price, but when you are serious about making a connection, it is what you have to pay.The Tram will remain as a back up in my go bag and as a loaner to other start up amateur radio operators. I was happy for the price I paid for it."
2624,"Just got this in. The package reads, "" Made in Philippines by TOKINA Co., Ltd.  So it's not Hoya HMC that's made it Japan, it TOKINA made in the Philippines.  Fits nice. I was just expecting a Hoya filter made in Japan. I did some research and found that there is a TOKINA plant in the Philippines. Labor costs is much lower in the Philippines than Japan. Just like the USA uses Mexico's cheap labor than using the high cost American workers."
2625,"Worked for what I needed them 4, Just don't like that fact the ends are so bulky and the screw thingys are really hard to grip onto as there's no lining or anything on em. Otherwise they are 6 ft of basic cable  that worked just perfectly. I did noticed that sometimes my monitor didn't always turn on right away when I boot, but I noticed video cards doing that now a days with 3 different outputs on em like mine. Has 1 DVI, 1 VGA and 1 HDMI, sometimes my PC acts dumb and if I hook a VGA up to it when it doesn't load the DVI part, that works haha. I think there supposed to be an extra pin on this wire for your PC, so it knows that it's DVI 4 sure, but they dont always come with it. I guess try to see if there's a 19 pin one, if there is, you'll be better off getting that one instead of this, UNLESS...your PC doesnt have VGA or HDMI period, then this cord would be perfect. I had this problem once with a VGA cord. wouldn't work on my moms PC to her TV. Found out there was a extra pin inside of the cords specifically for those kinda models. I had a standard 14 pin VGA cord, I needed a special 15 pin one just for her TV lol, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had those for DVI cords too. So for people who are having problems with DVI, that might be why believe or not"
2626,"Careful, these protectors can get deep scratches easy but still does it's job.On the bottom right corner, it's peeling, but I think it's a issue with my case.Unlike other protectors, it doesn't make the screen all fuzzy.For the money, it does the job."
2627,"I ordered this cover,  it was supposed to be book style, but was a flip one.  It is nice, a beautiful color.  Just expected different."
2628,"It worked with my Samsung plasma TV, but I didn't like the quality of picture I was getting.  I'm sure it's the same with all 3D glasses, but I'd rather just watch the movie in 2d and get all the vibrant colors and clarity."
2629,"Made in China, supported in India .... instructions are almost laughable with misspelling and mispronounciation.  Does not support newer computer software and protocols.  FYI, I have a BS in computer science and 40 years in the field.  Once I finally did get it set up, the PCTool will lock up my computer."
2630,"I really wanted a protective cover for my Kindle that wouldn't ruin it's lightweight slimness. This does fit the bill on that score. It's significantly heavier than the sticker-like ""skins"" that are out there, giving my Kindle a bit of protection, but I am disappointed that the cover doesn't cover the screen.The cover is nice and light so the Kindle isn't noticeably heavier and the buttons are still easy to press.The only thing lacking is some kind of screen protection. I had hoped that this had a transparent plastic cover that would go over the screen too. This lack is the reason I gave it three stars instead of five. Overall, it's a nice cover just not as much protection as I wanted."
2631,They refunded but too bad it didn't work. I liked the design. Could come with a longer USB cable too.
2632,"Since I bought them as spares, I didn't notice until later that one was defective.  Also, the cable is somewhat thick and un-wiedly.  Not bad, but just not what I was expecting from a Belkin product."
2633,"The wide angle will not work on an G12, Canon dosn't even offer a wide lens that will work on this camera, no one at this time does. The telephoto and hood work great and are worth the price."
2634,Was cool to have my first tablet but after buying an ipad I have no idea how I even touched this thing. Don't get me wrong this isn't terrible but it is very slow and the screen sensitivity is bad. I would not recommend this product
2635,"I read other reviews about the ""tunnel-like"" sound that this device produces, but I purchased it anyway. I was on a budget and I didn't plan to use this device frequently. I removed the metal plate in the bottom of the device (as recommended in reviews), and the range was about 30ft. I used the Belkin Bluetooth with an iPod touch, iPad, Mac mini, and Blackberry Curve and had no problems syncing.Note: You can only sync (1) device at a time. If you don't disconnect the 1st transmitting device (e.g. iPod touch) before trying to connect a second transmitting device, you must unplug the Belkin Bluetooth to reset it. The Belkin Bluetooth will not automatically connect to any device."
2636,The item came in good condition but with one of the 3 parts missing. The part that went missing must have fell out of the packaging which was inadequately sealed.
2637,"I bought this despite the warnings about it having an extremely loud fan.  It was too much to bear and I sent it back.  I could hear it from two rooms over while I was eating dinner so I decided to return it.  I may opt for a video card that doesn't have a fan.Functionally, it worked just fine - no issues there.  It was just way too noisy IMO."
2638,I am unsure of the product quality due to the fact that I didn't understand that on most Motherboards if you add a video card it knocks out the on board video card.  It is hard to get back into the know when you have been away from it for so long.
2639,"The down side:1)There is no light to indicate that data is being transferred. Until your computer picks up the data flow and asks what you want to do with it you are blindly hoping.2)Always feels on the verge of falling apart in your hand. Cheaply made.The up side:1)It works especially well with SATA drives, so far.2)The card reader included with it was a pleasant surprise. I use it on a couple of older computers and it works well. Made it worth the purchase price."
2640,"I ordered this because I thought it was going to be a fun toy. It is ok, the screen isn't as sensitive as I would have liked, but it drives my fans and looks good."
2641,Unit appears to work - but caution if you plan to use this with a USB adapter for cloning a drive as you cannot plug in the power connector (as least on both USB to IDE adapters I have) as the USB adapter is wider than a cable.  It is easy to solder a power pig-tail.
2642,Item arrived quickly in plain white unlabeled box.  Batteries fit REALLY tight..  something a little weird there.  You have to tuck the top end of battery in first or it will bend the metal tab underneath the battery.  Not a dealbreaker... but seems like the ones with the metal spring rather than the metal tab might be better.  Charging now.  Will see how that goes and report.Update 12-13-12.  I tend to use my other charger due to the tight fit of this charger. (protected batteries are just a hair longer and seem to fit too tight and wants to bend in or fold the metal tabs and ruin it if your not careful).  but it seems to work ok..
2643,"The GreatShield does the job of protecting the iPod.  A couple times, the iPod has been dropped from about three feet, and has survived intact.However, the back of the iPod has been scratched by the GreatShield, and the GreatShield has broken after about eight months.  It broke where it is thinnest, at the bottom near the right side.  I bought a new one, which broke four months later.  I'm not sure whether I will try a third time...."
2644,"I don't think the item was defective but it interfered with the proper operation of the cable box we've got.  The single action of removing this connector & just plugging the RG6 cable directly into the wall plate eliminated a severe signal strength degradation that was causing numerous channels to not be received by the cable box.  Of course, there's the whole issue of why is a cable box even required & why is it so touchy about the signal strength it receives, but that's for an entirely different forum."
2645,Replacement power supply and USB cable.  Just as I expected with fast delivery.  I would have liked for it to include a longer cable than the oriiginal.
2646,"This product works but I had to really press it up on my port and wiggle it to get the best picture. Hopefully this doesn't gradually degrade over time to a point where it doesn't work anymore. Here's hoping, keeping my fingers crossed."
2647,"I found this cable to be about what you'd expect for a Cat6 cable. It gets the job done, but it doesn't do anything extraordinary beyond what you'd expect from just about every other Cat6 cable out there. I do with they'd have at least done something with marking the cable so that it's more obvious what type it is, rather than just leaving us to hope that we remember.The short version is that if you already have older ethernet cables that you're using, it's probably not going to be worthwhile to switch them out unless there's something obviously wrong with them. Cat5 cables will do the job just fine for most home use because home Internet connections generally aren't so fast that the difference matters. In fact, if they hadn't offered me this as a review item I would still be using my Cat5 cable and leaving an upgrade to Cat6 on the 'someday' list. On the other hand if you're adding a new computer to your network or setting up a new network, the price difference is small enough that it's worth getting something like this so that you won't have to deal with the expense and hassle of going through an upgrade later if you find that you actually have a need for Cat6."
2648,"The Belkin 8-Outlet Surge Protector with USB is big, really big.  Given the size you would think that it would be designed well enough to allow for use of large DC converters and USB ports at the same time but you can't.  It would have been much better to place the USB charging ports on the sides or ends."
2649,I like the fact you can find anything on Company A I dislike the fact you have to replace cables within the first week of ownership connector broke at the tip
2650,"Pros:It actually worksappears highly compatibleTinyCHEAPP....Cons:it is Sata1, so it has relatively slow transfers (yes you will notice it).They should have used SATA2/3. The IDE interface port is short, soit does not mate with the IDE drive perfectly - (as one reviewerpointed out).  Also, it is a little off on the quality.Conclusion: if you need to convert a 2.5 drive badly go for it !Its dirt cheap and works."
2651,"OK I just installed the holder finally to my Xoom, but am a little disappointed in the material used for the rings. I thought it would be a little more flexible, but it is made with stiff fragile plastic. In the instructions stated to apply the ring and press firmly around the ring, DO NOT DO THAT. The ring have a sticky adhesive, simply place it exactly where you want it then attach the strap half on it, then press down firmly. Sadly, I used three fingers and pressed down, the damn tiny fingers just crumbled in the three places. Yes, it still worked like that but I am fearing the three spots will ruin the strap side, and that is not replaceable. And I plan on taking the strap off and on a lot.The company does not warn you in any shape or form of this slight fault, in the instructions or website. If they had made this out of say nylon, it would have been more flexible and not stay crushed. The only other fault I can find, besides the too high of price for product, is the strap itself, in the summer time your hand might end up sweating, because it is made if neoprene.I had originally put the ring in the wrong stop, I removed it and reapplied with no problem, holds firm, but I now need to replace it because of the reason above. I will add a picture above to show of the problem.I like the product because I had a fear of dropping the tablet and the need to hold it with two hands. But of course now you only use one hand for typing, but I use Swype a lot with a stylus."
2652,"I do not like the aluminum foil innter shield, had to shorfen the cable and install a PL-259 so got a good look inside.The inner coax shield is made of aluminum foil and not the kind of cable I am accustomed to.The crimp on connectors leave me feeling that they may not be best for outside use. I taped the outside connector very well to aboid problems.Not sure how this cable performs at VHF and do not think would use if for any bands above 28 mHz."
2653,"First off, I'm glad I didn't have to install this in my car, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The EQ is generic, the menu is hard to navigate, and you have to hold the menu or EQ buttons to actually get to the menu or EQ. I installed this in a friend's car while trying to do a stereo for under $200. This radio helps if that's what you want to do. The price tag is right, but if you like to be specific with your music, then this probably isn't the stereo to be picky with. The EQ is actually rather good for a cheap model radio, it just doesn't make it easy to adjust. I would think though, that if you buy this radio you'd probably just turn the loud mode on and pump a bazooka tube out of the trunk. For under $100, I would not blame you. It's decent, I just wouldn't buy it for myself, and I'm just trying to be honest."
2654,"I *like* the smallness and relative lack of features on this radio. Other satellite radios we have owned had too many features -- we could never find the station we wanted! This design lets you scroll through categories, scroll through stations, pick five presets, and that's all. Perfect!If sound quality is at all important to you, I don't recommend the ""Power Connect"" installation. There is no way to avoid FM interference. But if you have a car radio that lacks an input jack, Power Connect does what it's designed to do: provides an inexpensive way to get your satellite fix without a hardware upgrade.How to run the wire from the receiver to the antenna without creating an ugly mess on the roof perplexes me, I admit.--A day later... ""Power Connect"" is worse than I thought. So bad, XM really shouldn't advertise it. I had the radio wired into the car at a shop for $100. So this wasn't quite the inexpensive solution I thought it was, but now I have really good sound."
2655,"Just placed my order, didn't know I'll need to replace it...had the black pen for a while & never replaced the nib thingy, however I lost that black pen & had to replace it with the silver one.When I notice I had to replace the nib is when I was taking it out the nib back in fourth while waiting for rendering, exporting video projects. Ended up being that the pen didn't want to stick in its right place after messing with it. I tried placing the nib upside down from its regular use & ended up working out fine , but I guess the nib was already blend side ways a bit  that the pen wasn't reading it right, which made the mouse on the computer highlight everything & not working properly.Well lets see when I get these NIB replacements in the mail, In the meantime I bought a Gigaware mouse with a while on it...cheapest one RAdio shack had..I don't like it so far -lol.. But have to wait until Tuesday on that Prime shipping."
2656,"I've used zoom lenses for a very long time and have been my lens of choice to avoid constantly changing lenses.  The zoom range is perfect for my needs and the zooming mechanism is smooth.  The only caveat I have is with the piezo electric drive.  You can both feel the movement and hear the very quiet sound of the motor when it's focusing -- not a problem!  My only complaint is that the focusing seems to have difficulty resolving the primary subject at times and results in an unsharp image.  In those situations, I can feel the focusing motor still being active.  It seems to happen most frequently under low-light situations, i.e., indoors and not brightly lit (I don't mean candlelight situations).  I'm otherwise very happy with the lens' performance."
2657,I got it on sale and I am not a camera nut. It does what I want it too. I don't believe they are for sale any more.
2658,"I have probably a half a dozen LowePro bags (the downside of having a photography hobby) and this bag is the first one that I thought was a bit of a disappointment. I like pockets on camera bags because there's no shortage of stuff you carry, from memory cards to misc cables.Like all of the LowePro bags I have, they're built ruggedly - very well padded and can handle some abuse. Something this small should feel like it should take some abuse. The camera fit a T2i with kit lens pretty snugly, but it's designed for those who went for the 4/3rds cameras. I'd even use this for a larger megazoom digital camera.The price is what causes me some reservation. At $50, it's far more expensive than their other bags this size. I'd recommend something like theLowepro Edit 100 Camcorder Bag (Black)or theLowepro Adventura 170 Camera Case (Black)simply because if you've already bought a camera and an extra lens, you're on your way to spending more money on the camera for additional accessories.This is a decent bag, but the price kills it."
2659,I brought these for my husband because I was VERY pleased with my pair.  . he loves them but I find them a little uncomfortable because they are large without cushioning like mine so if you're purchasing for someone small these may not work . I was surprised of the high quality of them for the price . When wearing mine I can't hear a thing around me
2660,"That's about all I can swear to.  I put it in my phone and now I can store pictures that I take as well as transfer them to the PC.  Can't ask for more than that, I suppose, but I don't really have anything to compare it with."
2661,"I live in California's central valley.  I tried getting a AM station that is about 70 miles away and had no luck with this radio...I did manage to find it, but never could get it fine tuned no matter where I placed the radio, day or night , where I turned the antenna and what I dialed the fine tuning to.  So for this reason I had to return it.On the good hand the AM & FM stations that it did catch sounded wonderful.  So for this I give it 3 stars, but only 3 since I can't catch something on AM that is only 70 miles away."
2662,"I use this stylus with my tablets and it works OK.  I find that it is very handy, but it does not always ensure my selection.  This may be due the tablets being designed and programmed for the average finger tip (and not necessarily a stylus).  The biggest advantage to using the stylus is that it does not mark up the screen with finger prints."
2663,"I ordered this Media Bridge and a like cable from Blue Rigger. I personally preferred the Blue Rigger cable, but this cable wasn't bad either. It fit just a bit loose on my Samsung Note 2, otherwise I found no issues with this cable."
2664,If you just take pictures at a normal pace these batteries work fine.  I was able to get about 75% as many photos as the factory original battery.  Which for the price is very reasonable.However... when I put my camera into rapid shot mode I get maybe 50% as many shots from one of these when fully charged.  If I then turn on the flash during rapid shot mode I get maybe 30% as many shots and the speed of taking photos actually slows down as the battery can no longer provide power to the flash at the rate needed.
2665,"What's in the boxMedia player with built-in hard driveRemote control with batteriesAC adapterQuick Install GuideIntroductionThis is a multimedia device that tends to fall flat, in my opinion.  For the average consumer, most people want everything that they need, right out of the box.  This system is not that easy to set up or collate everything necessary to do so.  The quick start guide is confusing and misleading with simple pictures showing how this attaches to various devices such as a router, a monitor, peripherals; however, it is unclear how this all fits in the big scheme of operating this device.  The box with the description is misleading and confusing.  Is this ready for WIFI right out of the box?  The answer is NO!!!  I recommend going to the manufacturer's website and downloading the complete user's manual before attempting to proceed.First and foremost, no where on the packaging or quick start guide that the WIFI is not integrated and must be purchased.  Considering that I do not have a WD TV Live Media Player or DLNA/UPnP peripheral, this is no more than a multimedia hard drive for me.  With that being said, I will proceed upon how I am using this.SetupI proceeded to take a portable USB hard drive and connect it to the Media Center.  The process is extremely slow at a transfer of about 10 Mbs.  I left it connected overnight.UseUpon unforetold hours (a time indicator should be integrated to give the user an idea of how long the process should take in this modern age), I turned on the unit.  There are several settings:PhotosVideosFilesNetwork related featuresPhotosPhotos are easy to navigate but it is cumbersome to do so.VideosVideos are classified by how your files are organized on your hard drive. Basic functions such as pause, fast forward work.  Unless your files have chapters, the skip function will play the next file.  It is cumbersome and watching some lower resolution movies on a 1080p system is not aesthetically pleasing due to pixelization.OverallThis is a system that should have included all necessary attachments to make a system like this work.It will serve the general multimedia tasks that I have but it is by no means perfect.  It is mediocrre at best, and there are other alternative systems that will serve the users better."
2666,"I've had this device for about 5 months now to connect my PC to my Sony Bravia LCD.  I used to have the PC connected to the TV just via a standard VGA monitor cable and it was fine.  This setup has higher resolution, but video DOES lag a bit.  I had to get an upgraded video card that was compatible with this device, but that was only about $50.  The transmitter and receiver are in direct line of sight, literally nothing in the way.  Video is OK on it, but not great.  I have both my PC monitor and the TV set at 1280x1024, but i can't get the output to the TV to fill the whole TV screen unless i use the ""wide zoom"" setting on my TV .. it just blows it up a bit and it looks like it loses some resolution.  I do have an older PC that JUST meets the windows Aero minimum specs, so this may be the issue in getting a non-choppy video feed to the TV.  The LCD TV is about 6yrs old now (works perfectly though), so maybe my TV just doesn't like this device too much.  Anyways, it's OK for watching basic stuff, but for anything where there is a lot of fast movement forget it.One ANNOYING thing is does is when the PC turns off the display to save power, then you come back and move the mouse and wake up the screen.. the PC monitor comes back instantly .. then your screen goes blank .. then it comes back on.. then it goes blank .. then comes back on .. then goes blank once more .. then back on.  This is what it does as the USB adapter tries to re-connect to the TV receiver thing.  It's SO ANNOYING.  YOu can't use any power saving features unless you are OK going through that process every time you want to use your PC.Bottom line, it does work, but i feel this is still version 1.0 of these types of video transmitters and they will get better.  But as an alternative to having a whole cable box, Apple TV, whatever, setup, this is the best way to get content from your PC to your TV."
2667,"I wanted a thin case for my iPod.  Just something simple.  This is simple but it is also very loose.  The corners slip off very easily and the bottom has a tiny strip of silicone across it which flops around when you're using the iPod.  I ended up cutting that bit off.  It makes the case even more prone to slipping off, but makes using the iPod much easier.Overall, this is a good choice if you don't put your iPod in a pocket or purse but don't expect miracles."
2668,"We generally find the iPod to be so thin and slippery that sometimes that makes operation a bit difficult.  I thought this case might be the solution.  However, what I am finding after several days of use is that is actually makes the buttons more difficult to operate.  The iPod has a nice feel to the buttons, not too easy to accidentally push, but not too firm either.  This case has the silicone material around all of the side buttons (volume, screen on/off button on top) and it actually makes them a bit harder to push, even though the button covers on the case are slightly raise.The case wraps around the front edge of the iPod as well, and I find that it comes a bit too close to the home button at the bottom of the button, making it more difficult to press.  Also, because the material wraps around the front, games which require the entire screen to play can get obstructed because it's more difficult to get your finger at the very edge of the screen with the silicon material in the way.I can understand with a device as small as the iPod that making a secure case would be difficult.  This case is definitely light weight, secure, and protective.  However, I think I would rather operate my iPod without it."
2669,"This will definitely help you if you have wrist pain... till your pinky finger starts going numb in a week or two from your hand wresting on it constantly.I really wish some of the professional reviewers had used the mouse for more than a few days to write their reviews. This is a major flaw and makes the mouse useless.== Update April 12, 2014 ==I just went ahead and started dragging my pinky around instead of wresting my hand on it and it's a much better experience. It took a little getting used to but now I don't really notice my pinky is on my mousepad instead of the mouse.So, I've upped my rating to three stars from one. The only real problem I have now is I constantly hit the back button (it's on the very top of the mouse) when I go to put my hand on the mouse if I'm not looking at it. This is extremely annoying if you've just typed for 10 minutes and your work is gone because you just went ""back"" in the browser."
2670,Nice bag but I carry so much stuff with my tablet I needed more pockets. But is stuff all in there and get around. Easy access to tablet when you pop open
2671,"OK,My quest for the perfect camera began 1 year ago. I had a simple Canon SD750, which I thought was a good digital camera. I didn't know anything about DSLRs or super zooms - I thought those big cameras were 35mm. Anyway, I was at party where someone had a Panasonic FZ28. I really liked it. I didn't know there were cameras that had such high zoom. And so my camera education began....After A LOT of research, I bought a Panasonic FZ35. I had this camera for 10 months. It took razor sharp pictures in daylight, the zoom was fun, but it lacked low light performance. After much more research, it appeared that the Sony HX100V had great low light performance, so I decided to sell my FZ35 for the HX100V. I justified the $$, and bought it. Here is what I liked and disliked....Likes: The camera is solid, has great features, great picture quality with sunlight, good high ISO up to about 800, SD card compatible, great zoom, good portrait low light pictures, great burst shooting, excellent video.Dislikes: SLOW shot to shot times, SLOW start up, SLOW zoom, poor low light action shooting (burst - no flash), slow movie starting. I ended up missing many photo opportunities while waiting for the camera to write the last set of pictures to the card. The slowness of even changing modes was very frustrating. This is my biggest complaint, and I even tried to rectify it and purchased a Scandisk Extreme Pro. The camera was quicker, but not quick enough for me. As for picture quality - indoor portraits with flash - very good. Outdoors - good, although my FZ35 was sharper outdoors (sucked indoors).What I have come to realize is that there is no perfect camera for everyone, you must first define your priorities and make sacrifices. In the beginning of my quest for the perfect camera, I ranked cost and portability as my number (1) priority, followed by HD video, and than features. After almost a year of shooting with the FZ35, and 2 months with the HX100V, I realized that most of the pictures I am taking are of my son's TaeKwonDo tournaments. The FZ35 could not handle the indoor lighting, and the video was average. The HX100V did better if shooting with flash or using video, but not so good trying to capture action shots indoors (burst mode). I tried using it at a tournament, but ended up having to use video (which turned out great). The shutter lag and low shutter speeds needed caused missed shots or blurry pictures. I tried using it at an airshow, but the tracking focus had trouble keeping up even in good light. I tried using it to take pictures at a birthday party at an indoor roller skating rink - useless, I put it back in the car. I was left wanting more.I determined that my priorities had changed to indoor action picture quality as number (1), with portability and video not as important anymore (as I rarely used the video on the HX100V, and I was already carrying a bag to hold the camera stuff). I decided to try a DSLR, and ordered the Pentax K-R.I am a lot happier with the DSLR as it's low light action shot is amazing, gorgeous portraits, start up and shot to shot times are speedy. Yes, it cost me more money, but the picture quality is worth it for me. No, it's not as portable, but it is the smallest DSLR and lenses are cheap for this camera. It isn't much bigger than the Sony HX100V.So, if you've gotten this far in my review, please know your camera  priorities first so you don't end up going through what I did.This is a great camera if your priorities are:- portraits (indoor or outdoor)- outdoor (action, stills, wildlife)- HD movie makingThis is not a camera for:- Indoor action- fast moving subjects (such as an F/A18 going 700 mph)- needing to change settings quicklyI thought I would miss the zoom, but my 300mm lens gets me almost as close. Cropping the picture gives almost as good picture quality as the HX100V did without cropping. Now I understand all the fuss around larger sensor cameras (DSLRs). It makes a HUGE difference.If you pan on taking pictures of landscapes, indoor stills, outdoor anything, movies, than this camera will do it beautifully. If you have kids with a lot of indoor sport activities - you'll need a DSLR, unless you are just making a video. Hope this helps. :)"
2672,"I use stylus for writing and marking other documents. I have been testing several stylus. This is better than many but not as good as the best I found.Good:1. Has pocket clip so you can carry it like a regular pen2. is light and feels like a regular pen when held between fingers3. reasonable material qualityNot so good:the felt tip can be improved. There are times that its movements are not properly registered. The angle at which you have to hold the pen is more restricted. Finally, there is higher friction making faster writing or drawing little harder.If you plan to use the stylus for extensive writing or drawing, I recommend AluPen. It is heavier with better tip. The biggest negative is that it has no pocket clip and I tend to loose it."
2673,"Could not get the num pad to work at all, but all other keys worked fine. Tried Toshiba site for drivers, but to to avail."
2674,"It's cheap, works, but not recommended for long use, it often gets very hot with just 20 minuted of use and isn't as great as the original. I mostly use it for traveling and keep the original at home.It's worth the buy, but save money in the mean time to buy an original charger."
2675,"When I ordered it i found it a great price.. I also figured it was actually 350 watts peak power, the real bummer is its 350 watts power seperated amongst all 5 channels if you only hook up two speakers it does not transfer extra power even if you hit the 2.1 button.. It looks really nice.. And it has nice features such as the mic inputs and sd card reader the radio on it is to be desired if you lose the special antenna the radio is worthless.. Wish it had more power but you get what you pay for.."
2676,"The good: The sound quality is considerably better than what you'd get with a typical dongle-style USB sound card.The bad: The sound quality is much, _much_ worse than what you'd get with something built for professional-grade work....and really, those lines sum it up. You get a lot more inputs and outputs than the tiny little dongles provide with this, and somewhat better quality, but if you care enough about your audio to want to be sure that if you hear an artifact it's coming from the source and not from the DAC (or want silence to really be silent), this just plain isn't the right tool for the job."
2677,"I had bought another one, pretty much the same (if not the exact same) and apparently a guest tripped over it causing a small spark/fire.The one I have now I've had for a few months and without it my laptop would surely be fried. Good news is no problem so far. Bad news is, the fans on these guys aren't crazy powerful. Good news is there are 3 so it gets the job done.Cord takes some getting used to (positioning it is all over the place) and watch out for the rough edge on the pass-through end (female usb side). Not 'sharp' but a looks like if you use the pass-through it could easily get serrated."
2678,"We first bought one for my mother, it fit fine and worked well.I then bought one for myself for the same model laptop, sadly, mine doesn't fit in one corner. I've tried SO HARD to fix this problem, but it didn't work. I've learned to live with it, one corner just doesn't fit and now it doesn't bother me much.I have my case on because i'm afraid of scratching my beloved macbook air, but I do think it makes the laptop much chunkier. At first, I really didn't like the flip-out stand thing on the bottom because it added to the chunky-ness but I can't complain anymore since I use it quite often."
2679,"I drive a BMW F650 Dakar, Its a very quiet bike at 60-70 mph and these work but I can't image anyone with a louder bike, which is most everyone, would be all that happy with them. Also! There are plenty of amplifiers options for head phones..."
2680,"I just wanted something quick and cheap to use for when we play in our pool in the yard or in any water. This is a decent camera and rather easy to use. I love that you can take a picture in the normal was as well as use the front screen to take the picture such as when you take one of yourself or with a friend. I don't like how this camera uses standard batteries rather than a rechargeable one since regular batteries tend to go very fast in cameras. Also, I don't care for having to use a micro SD card instead of the standard size (even though it said it in the description I originally overlooked this detail - my fault). The quality of the pictures are okay, but nothing I would use every day. If you want it strictly for water use like us then it's an okay camera, but other than that you will be disappointed. I have a collection of digital cameras and I am one for high quality photos so my opinion may be a bit bias on this one.I allowed my 5 year old to play with this one in our 2.5 foot deep pool and she had no problems and the camera operation worked just fine. No water got into the camera so it is in fact waterproof as it states."
2681,"This case is nice and slim, slimmer than I expected, and it serves its purpose very well. It has great protection for a case this size, let me emphasize that it is great! The problem is though the port cover doesn't stay completely closed, and the part that covers the button got stretched after a month of use and doesn't fit tightly anymore, this might not bother some people but I like everything perfect so that didn't work for me, I no longer use this case anymore. If you don't mind things like that (maybe) happening then this is a good, slim, and durable case!Let me know if my review was helpful!"
2682,"That being said, leave the batteries out. After that, at a glance it will make anyone think twice about if it is real or not. It is made of plastic, and you need to be careful on the install. It did convince my entire extended family that we had security monitors at our son's birthday party!"
2683,only two issues:1>...sometimes takes time to get the signal2>..gets lost in crowded places with tall buildings like downtown.. not always though...after 1 year of use .... hangs up often and starts after driving around 1 mile..inconvenient for this reason
2684,Because it sounds like there is a jet engine in the room.pros:* burns pretty much all popular optical media formats* relatively fast* cheap for blu-ray* lightscribecons:* LOUD when in use!!!!* Vibration - I am somewhat worried about HDD damage from how much this shakes the case when in use.  And I have a huge 45lb tower.
2685,Does exactly what it says it will do. Connected easily to my IPhone 5 without needing a password. Reconnects automatically when I get in my car. It's SO nice not to have to plug the AUX cable into my phone every time I want to play music from my phone. Overall great product.***UPDATE*** After about 2 months of use I notice that the volume level when using this device is significantly lower than plugging it directly into my phone. Works ok for most listening however if I really want to crank it and have perfect clarity I still need to plug the AUX cable directly into my phone.
2686,"*****UPDATE 06/10/2011*****I just tried to use this drive to back up Windows 7 X64 Professional and the update failed multiple times. After researching the error that Windows was generating, I learned that the hard drive included in this drive is a new, ADVANCED FORMAT drive with a sector size of 4096 bytes instead of the previous standard of 512 bytes. Windows back-up and restore doesn't currently support ADVANCED FORMAT drives, meaning this drive is currently USELESS as a back up if you want to make a system image of your Windows machine. This is a major issue, and while I place the blame more on Microsoft than on Iomega since the new sector size will ultimately be the industry standard, it currently creates issues for Windows users for one the PRIMARY uses of an external hard drive: backing up your system.Windows has released a windows update to address this issue, but it DOES NOT allow Windows to work with ADVANCED FORMAT drives that do not support an emulated version of 512 byte sectors. This Iomega drive DOES NOT support emulation, meaning the Windows update will not allow you to use the drive for backing up Windows.Due to this limitation, I've lowered my review from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars.*****END OF UPDATE****This Iomega Prestige portable hard drive is excellent. I have owned dozens of portables of all sizes and from many manufacturers, including the big guys like Western Digital and Seagate, and this one stacks up against the best of the best in terms of quality and design.The first and most noticeable thing is that the drive is TINY. Barely larger than the 2.5"" hard drive enclosed inside, Iomega has minimized the size of the enclosure to as small as possible. This makes it ultra portable and as light weight as any enclosure I've encountered.Aesthetically the drive is excellent. The brushed, anodized aluminum enclosure in matte black is of superior quality. It has a well designed, finished feel that many inferior drives do not. The corners are not rough, and the LED indicator is flush with the drive's exterior, etc... These are small things, but I pay attention to them and appreciate it when they're done right.The USB 3.0 interface is still being perfected, but I managed to get upwards of 80mb / sec read times and 60-65mb / sec writes. That's still 3-4x faster than USB 2.0, and I expect those speeds to go up a bit as USB drivers are improved in the next year or so. For a small, compact, and well made drive, these read and write speeds are really excellent.This is an ideal second notebook drive whether you use the USB 3.0 functionality or not (most notebooks made prior to 2010 don't have a USB 3.0 port). It's among the smallest, lightest, and most well built drives I've ever owned. The warranty is only 3yrs (I've seen drives with 5yr warranties) but that's a minor issue considering the speed at which technology moves these days. In three year SSDs will be the new normal and spinning disks will feel like floppy disks (so maybe that's an exaggeration but you get the idea).Regarding the encryption software on the drive:When you first connect the drive you will notice that it has two partitions: the main partition formatted with NTFS formatting, and an smaller 700MB partition in CDFS format that contains the encryption software. The CDFS partition CANNOT be removed using standard formatting--you must use the tool provided as part of the encryption software. The version of the software that came on my drive was not up to date; I had to go to the Iomega website and get the newest version that allows for removal of the CDFS partition.I removed the encryption from my drive because I only plan to use the drive for media files.Here is how I would score the drive:Design:  5 StarsForm factor:  5 StarsQuality:  5 StarsRead / Write Speed:  5 StarsIncluded software:  N/AWarranty:  4 StarsPrice point:  4 StarsSuitability for windows backup: 0 StarsOverall: 3.5 StarsRecommendation: A nice little drive with good build quality, but you currently (as of June 2011) cannot use it with Windows Backup due to it's 4096 byte sector size. Only buy this drive if A) You need encryption built into your drive AND B) You don't care about backing up your system using Windows Backup and Restore."
2687,"I put ok as I haven't really had a chance to get things going yet. Some issues with using it with XP Windows, I will update my review when I get it working smoothly."
2688,I don't know if it is an issue with the drivers or windows - but this device drops keyboard/mouse connections a bit too frequently to be a random issue. Aside from that they work OK.Really do wish they didn't lose connection though!
2689,"Good loud clear sound when it is running.Mini USB charger port (why?) instead of micro so I have to carry the mini cable with the micro adapter instead of just one cable.Wierd super short light gauge charge cable provided with long stereo audio cable spliced into it, I guess for chaining devices.Controls are way fiddly, not that intuitive to use and hard to find.No user manual I could find on vendor site and provided paper manual is 3 feet long so hard to scan without cutting it up.Provided manual is super fine print.Play/pause causes Google Nexus 7 to start and stop my music playlist instead of playing/pausing the movie I am watching and so music plays along with the movie.Have not tried it as a speaker phone paired with a phone or tried it with Skype but if it works without echo I will be happy.Good tech and a good product overall but I think design overrode usability in a big way. Some kind of joy pad or something someplace with distinct funtions for each key would be a lot better. It should be able to be operated in the dark blind folded. Not sure what value specialized charge cable provides, regular cable and additional patch cable might suffice instead."
2690,Good:This LCD works great for checking to make sure your camera is aimed correctly.It has full text for each menu option on the display rather than just the 3 letters per menu option on the front.Bad:Skips playback of movies taken in 3D sync mode.  I'm guessing since the folders are named differently for 3D vs 2D it doesn't pick them up for playback.  It should be a simple firmware fix.You can't use the extra battery backpack and LCD at the same time so your camera is going to use batteries even faster.Expensive compared to the cost of the camera.
2691,it is a basic bluetooth. It has a stealth mode but haven't figured out how it helps yet. Mine didn't come with extra ear clips. To bad it didn't come in other colors.
2692,"On paper the ICD-PX312 has a good feature set, has USB & microSD slot for more storage. But the user interface is not very good compared to older models, particularly the Olympus VN-240.THE GOOD:+ Batteries are included. Also a a mini-USB to USB cable is included for transfer.+ Using the onboard memory (no external microSD) you can record for over 20 hours on SHQ mode.THE BAD:- Just as in previous Sony recorders I find the Recording interface is dumb. There are 2 large buttons: one labelled ""PLAY/STOP"", the other ""REC/PAUSE"". To start recording you press ""REC/PAUSE"" and recording starts. So far so good, right? The problem is stopping recording - if you press the large conveniently labelled ""PLAY/STOP"" button recording will stop BUT IMMEDIATELY PLAYBACK which is most cases is NOT what you wanted. To stop recording without playing back you have to hit the small unlabelled square icon ""stop"" button (located in the middle of 3 buttons). For the life of me I don't understand why it doesn't stop recording (without playback) when ""PLAY/STOP"" is momentarily pressed. If the user wanted to really review the just-completed recording he could just press ""PLAY/STOP"" one more time to playback. This would be a much better solution, because many people use a recorder for quick ""to me"" notes or lectures. When you stop recording you don't want to attract unwanted attention (in a lecture) or hear the note you just recorded, both of which will happen if you press the wrong stop button.- After stopping a recording there is a slight delay (about 1-2 seconds) while the recorder processes the recording (""ACCESSING"" is displayed during this time). There was no delay with the VN-240.- I wish I could say the bad UI design stopped there but there's more. Like most recorders there is a ""HOLD"" lock to prevent inadvertent presses from starting recording or playback (i.e. if you put it in a pocket). The problem is when the recorder is locked it only displays ""HOLD"" on a blank screen for 4 seconds THEN reverts back to the normal display so there is no way to know if it is locked after the 4 seconds pass! Oh sure, you could press a button and see if it displays ""HOLD"" when pressed (or look at the HOLD switch) but a better way to handle this is what the Olympus VN-240 does in HOLD: it blanks the display completely so it is obvious that the device is locked. One way around this problem is to power off the recorder instead of using HOLD - the display will be blank and of course it will not respond to button presses. The only downside of doing this is that the recorder takes 3-4 seconds to power on (from off).- By default, the recorder will power off in 10 minutes. This means that even if you have the recorder on and 10 minutes elapse after last using it, it will power off and you will have to turn it on before proceeding (after the power-up delay wait). Fortunately this auto-power off time is adjustable to 5/10/30/60/OFF.- The volume control is implemented as two digital buttons (VOL+ and VOL-). I prefer a old-style volume dial because it is faster/easier to adjust volume that way. (The VN-240 had a volume dial)- The device is taller than it feel it should be (it is 1/2"" taller than the VN-240). This makes it more noticeable in a shirt pocket. More importantly there is no pocket clip (as on the VN-240) so it will not stay upright in a shirt pocket.STATE OF THE RECORDER INDUSTRY:I find that the older Olympus models (like the VN-240, sadly no longer made) had a optimal interface (not to mention a pocket clip). Somehow manufacturers are making products that are worse than the older ones despite advances in technology! Even newer Olympus models aren't the same. For instance I cannot find any USB recorder with a shirt pocket clip. The ICD-PX312 could have been a 5-star product if these flaws didn't exist.Instead, I would recommend theOlympus VN-702PCas it has the same features but a better user interface (still no shirt pocket clip though).I hope you found this review helpful!"
2693,"Ok, I'm challenged I guess.  Destroyed the first one, got the second one on ok with no little bubbles. But now I have two nooks and only one screen protected.  Guess I'll have to buy another 2pack and try again."
2694,"I bought this keyboard becasue i researched the best wireless keyboards and it was amoung them.  My experience with it is ok.  Just ok.  However, I also bought a  HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2 (weeks ago) ...may not be solar but the look and feel blows ths logitech out of the water.  Soft touch is what I prefer.  For those who love the &#34;click&#34; and to hear...the Logitech Solar is for you.  I will use the solar as a secondary keyboard to my own."
2695,"arrived promptly and as described. strap long enough for tall or large persons. based on other reviews, I replaced the swivel clip with a solid steel non-swivel carbiner & D ring. shoulder padding could be a little longer.hard to beat for the price, even with the addition of the steel carbiner & d-ring."
2696,"One of the reasons that I was intrigued by this product, to be frank, was the carrying case.  Its egg-like shape is extremely eye-catching and you're not likely going to forget this on you're way out from wherever.The headphones, however, leave a lot to be desired.THE GOODThe headphones fit well and I mean REALLY well.  Despite the worrisome exterior factor of a flat face (is this going to irritate my ear?!?), they are actually quite comfortable.THE NOT SO GOODThe case is a really neat concept, but in practice it is annoying.  To get the headphones into the case, you plug them into their receptacles which works well enough.  However, I felt like I was wrestling with it slightly to get the cord into the narrow slit that encircles the perimeter.  I know that the point is to keep everything from falling out, but I think that the overall design would have been far better served if they made the opening wider and just provide a tight anchor point for the 3.5 mm jack instead similar to what they did with the earbuds!THE BADOk, it's not so bad, but for the price you are better off with a pair of Sennheisers or JVCs.  High ends are a little too ""brilliant"" for my taste.  Bass is fairly well produced and vocals sound natural.  What's weird for me, however, is that everything between low frequencies and vocals sound muddy and I've never encountered that on a pair of headphones before.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it doesn't sound ""right""...almost like I am hearing something through a perforated cheese cloth.  It's not bad...but it doesn't sound clear either.For the cool factor, the carrying case for the headphones will have friends wondering ""where you got these.""  For everyday use, however, they are simply OKAY."
2697,"I bought this strap because I have 2 others like it, a Nikon and an Opteka, but with both of those it is a really tight fit with a full size camera and a battery grip.  The strap on this is fine, great quality as are the 2 OP/TECH camera straps I own, and really long.  The problem is the base.  It is made out of a cheap feeling (and looking) piece of plastic with slots cut for the knob and the strap.  On top of that a thin piece of rubber is glued on.  The other two wrist straps I own have molded bases, with the important distinction that there is a standard 1/4-20 socket in them that matches the tripod socket in the base of the camera.  These make it easy to put the camera on a tripod, or a quick release plate, or even a Black Rapid strap without removing the wrist strap.  With this product, the plastic plate just hangs there, and the first time I took it off the knob went falling to the ground.Since I like the strap itself, and the neoprene cover, I've actually ordered another Opteka strap just to get the base.  I've also ordered a couple of sets of OP/TECH mini loop connectors so I can swap in the neck straps when wanted.  I'm sharing all of this between 3 cameras, 2 with grips, so I really don't want to be screwing around threading the straps through the camera connectors all of the time.  Kind of a round about and expensive way to do things, but it gets the job done."
2698,"I bought this over other receivers in its price range specifically for the streaming audio from android devices feature. It works but only sort of. Music pauses and skips constantly. I have a robust network, gigabit devices, dd-wrt firmware and cat6 connections. This feature needs ome work. Also if its networked why no apps?"
2699,"I have been looking for a great, large passive 3D TV.  All the specs on this look great, except for the 120Hz refresh rate and edge-lit LED with a funky local dimming feature.  I decided to go check it out in person at Best Buy.  I found one on display near me and noticed it had a dead pixel blue band running down the left side of the screen.  It's not really noticeable at first because the rest of the picture looked great.  So, I decided to go to another Best Buy about 15 miles away to get a good view of the screen.  Lo and behold, the demo at that Best Buy also had a dead pixel band, green this time, running down the left side of the screen right around the same spot.I am now very weary of buying this TV because 1) the screen may not be able to handle one months worth of on-time before the screen goes bad or 2) the TV can't handle the analog input signal properly distributed to Best Buy TVs or 3) there is a manufacturing problem with the screen.I read somewhere that the 65"" screen is made by a different manufacturer than the equivalent 55"" screen.I am going to hold off on buying this TV until I can find a good, ell QA'd 65"" passive 3D TV.  The Vizio didn't get as good reviews as the LG and active 3D glasses are 1) expensive 2) flicker gives me a headache and 3) uncomfortably heavy to wear for an entire movie."
2700,I hoped it would be faster than a 6 year old external adapter but no luck. Get 50 Mbps with it.
2701,"Very impressed with the build quality of the Le Pan tab.  Beautiful screen, and much better build than many other tablets, and all tablets in this price range.  Runs most apps well, screen swipes not as fast as tablets running duel cores, but who cares.  HBO go runs fine.  Quite happy overall with the tab.  BUT, the tablet, while downloading from Company A, started to force close everything.  Reset tablet and it still was happening.  Did a complete reset wiping tablet and solved the problem.  Probably just a random event.  BUT, the tablet must have caught the thrive's SOD because it would randomly fall asleep and not wake up with the start button.  Had to do a hard reset.  Happened at unrelated intervals 5 times in the last two days.  Even though I'm now rather bummed, I returned the tablet---I really don't want to carry a paper clip with me for reset everywhere I carry the tablet.  Android still has problems, even with this ""stable"" version.  I really wish Le Pan would post more information on their site like most other tablet brands."
2702,"This unit works alright.The main problems are continuous warnings when travelling down a non-highway.(truck mode)Or sharp curve warnings on straight road.And, ARE YOU KIDDING???  I paid $250 for a GPS with pop up ads??? I may return it just for this reason.Who wants commercials popping up when you're trying to use this thing?UPDATE: I did return it & bought the Garmin n&uuml;vi 50LM 5-inch Portable GPS Navigator instead.MUCH better product for a lot less money and NO POP UPS !!!!"
2703,"These are great little headphones for Ipad!  They hooked right up!  The sound is great.  The problem with them is the fit is AWFUL!They do not form to your head or do they tighten up.  The little square pads that go over your ears don't cover your ears nor do theymove to mold to the shape.  So outside noise is a big problem.  You have to play them louder since they don't fit right to your head,which makes it very loud for whomever is in the room with you.I think they are a great quality sound wise but functionwise there has to be better offers on the market.  Plus, for the $90 price tag,I would spend a little more and get great fitting headphones because comfort is very important when you are going to wear them foran hour or two."
2704,"Switching from Interlaced to Progressive, I soon found that the machine when recording on DVD from an S-Video input cannot do 480 Progressive. My source was a FiOS DVR signal. The video would repeatedly block up and stall out. It just couldn't handle the video. Even switching back to Interlaced, I see occasional signs of hesitation in the signal. There is no such blocking in the original signal, of course. What a shame - the recorder is so functional otherwise that they would put a substandard processor in it for video. There is a high speed dub mode, which I chose not to use. If it can't handle standard video, it surely wouldn't handle high speed. Compare to my 7 year old Pioneer DVR231. I used Progressive on every recording and there was never any signs of hesitation or stalling, no matter how vigorous the motion on screen in over 4000 recordings. One would think that in the seven intervening years processors would get better. Perhaps so, but evidently Magnavox chose a substandard processor for their unit. What a shame. Oh, they have no e-mail input so that the engineers can hear these complaints - telephone only. Yet again, what a shame."
2705,"OK as these things go, but install takes FOR FREAKING EVER (even to an SSD!) with all the patches and post-install whatnot going on.  It downloads two updates, reboots, downloads ~100 more, reboots, downloads ~80 more, etc.  Update got stuck in an endless loop and I wasn't even aware of it, just figured it was four more gobs of ~80 updates.  Not a Linux fanboi (yet) but a FREE Mint install takes almost no time in comparison, and the FREE office apps go along for the ride.  Did I mention Mint was FREE?  The world will be a better place when MS goes out of business.  Until then we have to suffer with their lame OS because most devices and apps target Windows."
2706,"This is very well priced.  Arrives very quickly, and works.  However, it isn't the fastest at writing the files as evidenced by the slight delay in my ability to take the next photograph."
2707,"HAVE THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 6 MONTHS. PLAYS PRE RECORDED DISKS PRETTY GOOD. PLAYS RECORDED DISC FROM DVD+R VERY GOOD, BUT WILL HICCUP ON AUDIO AND VIDEO ON 6 HOUR PLAYBACK. HICCUPS ON ALL DVD-R DISKS FROM 4 HOUR AND 6 HOUR RECORDING. JUST THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOME DOWNSIDES. OTHER THAN THAT IT FUNCTIONS WELL.PLAYBACK ON TWO HOUR RECORDINGS ARE FINE. DELIVERY AND PACKAGING FROM Company A WERE GREAT. AS WITH OTHER PANASONIC ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, I EXPECT IT TO FAIL IN ABOUT A YEAR."
2708,It is better than rabbit ears but still doens't take in several of the local channels.  I bought an ampllfier that helped somewhat but not the best.
2709,"It worked, but not that great. First, it was very sensitive to location, a couple of inches away from a good spot there was nothing but dead space (no channels). The good spots themselves were few and far between, with substantial differences in type, number, and quality of receivable channels. In the best spot, I could receive CBS, NBC, ION, FOX53, ZUUS, myTV, some with subchannels, of various image/sound stability, however no ABC, CW, FOX, PBS. This was a disappointment from the expectations set by the Mohu web site for my address."
2710,"This device barely picked up a couple more channels than I was getting with the antenna built into my TV. However, I think that depending on the area where you live, it might be a lot more useful for some people."
2711,"Looks good. Fits good. However PVC leatheer isn't leather, it is plastic. In addition, the magnetic closures are week, and do not keep the cover closed securly. There are better cases at a lower price. Bear Motion is one example."
2712,it was a good buy but is a little flimsy but since I only switch it occasionally when i test repaired computers  it is sufficient for my needs
2713,"I read in the reviews that this Ravelli (with mini-tripod) was comparable to the ""highly regarded and acclaimed"" Opteka tripod.So I ordered this and also ordered a Dolica Premium Traveler 60"" Carbon Fiber Tripod from Costco thinking I could use each for a different purpose. I returned the Ravelli because the case and tripod were covered with mold!Having said that, here are the other major differences:The Dolica is over twice the price ($199 plus tax from Costco)Center column on the Ravelli is metal - it's CF on the DolicaOverall height of the Ravelli is a few inches taller than the Dolica, but the folded length of the Ravelli is over 18""; the Dolica is 16.5""Dolica is about a half pound lighter.Dolica has 3 leg spread angles; Ravelli has 2.Both have legs that fold 180 degrees to allow for compact storage/travel.Locking mechanism for the leg spread is very straight-forward on the Dolica: press the actual metal part and move the leg. On the Ravelli you must press a plastic button which then activates an unseen mechanism which allows the legs to be adjusted.Head on the Dolica is, well, sweet - with three levels. There are no levels on the Ravelli. The Ravelli head is ""gritty"" when panning; the Dolica is nice & smooth.One leg on the Dolica unscrews so it can be used in conjunction with the center post as a mono pod. No such feature on the Ravelli.The Dolica comes with rubber feet AND with spikes that can replace the rubber feet by unscrewing the rubber feet and then screwing in the spikes - a tedious at best practice. And, with only spikes on the ends of the legs, the spikes can sink in as far as China (welcome home). Both of these guys need to solve the spike feet problem.The bag for the Dolica is much nicer.As other reviewers stated, Ravelli should not include the funny miniature tripod and use that cost savings to improve their basic tripod."
2714,Not a horrible tablet but needed to know some things in order to get google to function properly. Luckly I am a techie and enjoy opening things up to there full potential.
2715,"It's nice but could have done better. The packaging is interesting, a metal box, but has a protective foam that is badly done.---Es bonito pero podr&iacute;a tener mejor acabado. El empaque es interesante, una caja metalica, pero tiene una espuma de protecci&oacute;n que est&aacute; mal hecha."
2716,"These appear to be cheaply made and the sound is a bit tinny, but I just use them for listening to podcasts while I exercise. So for that purpose I suppose they are OK.I mistakenly thought I lost them, for a week. I was about to buy another set of earbud headphones, and to tell the truth, I was going to look at other brands.On the positive side, the price was pretty good when I bought them. I do like the purple color."
2717,"Nice sound, but noticably lower than any of my other earphones. Also the first pair I've ever lost the rubber part off of. Not sure how. I go through ALOT of earphones (usually break the cords) so I'll probbably try another pair at some point in the future. I love everything else logitech makes."
2718,"This Case Logic HD case does the job -- it has hard panels on the outside to help protect your portable hard drive, and inside, an elastic to hold the drive in place and a mesh pocket for cables.The interior dimensions are 3.3"" x 3"" x 5"" -- it fits my older model Western Digital hard drive with ease. (I don't have a model number, but it's the slimmer, more rectangular one with sort of a parallelogram profile.)It lost two stars because I don't feel like the hard exterior forms a good enough shell -- the sides aren't very rigid so it's basically sandwiching two hard panels around my hard drive. This does provide more protection than nothing, but I expected an actual hard shell given the product being titled ""Hard Shell 2.5-Inch Portable Hard Drive Case."" I feel like if this case was in the bottom of my bag and I dropped in a heavy textbook, it may not protect my drive.Overall, you'll get a degree of protection and convenience of having your drive and cables all in one place, but if you're looking for something that seems indestructible, don't be fooled by the ""Hard Shell"" in the name."
2719,"I initially installed this WD 4TB Green drive with two partitions on my Win7 i5 machine, on a SATA connection. For some reason, when transferring a lot of data, this thing would slow down to about 85MB/sec. Occasionally the data transfer would stall or 'blue screen'. I finally had to remove it from my PC.I did reformat it as a single drive and am using it on a SATA to USB3 interface with good (slow) results. It is a good device for large backups but I would not buy it again."
2720,"I was excited to get these, and after reading many positive reviews i was sure these things would sound excellent. I have had them for a week or so now, and i am disappointed on how they sound. I have had better sounding dollar store headphones.However, the reason for three stars is for the durable construction of the headphones. Plus the thick wires that seem not to get tangled."
2721,"I was expecting more on these, cause of the reviws, but i was disapointed because i have a maxell cheap headphones that sound much better than these JVC's, but they are not bad specially for the price."
2722,"Well. It holds two batteries, and initially it worked well....until. I took off the chord for the shutter button to fit my camera into my bag. When I put the wires back, into their connectors, the shutter button failed to work. Somehow there was a short in the wire. I took the grip off and when I put it back on. The camera wouldn't recognize it as a proper battery. After some shaking and praying... It recognized the battery. Bottom line, is it holds two batteries. If it works half the time. Oh! And it makes my camera look beefy and expensive."
2723,"If Company A would only make the connectors smaller so they would fit into the charging ports of waterproof cases, they would be perfect."
2724,"The product got delivered so fast. It's a Great Innovative product. The coverage range is good. Very Compact Design. But has couple of issues.1. Finding the WiDi Drivers and Software is not so easy. Am technically sound But still it's hard for me to find the drivers and install properly. Check the Netgear Site and make sure you have compatible laptop which listed in the site. Otherwise you can't connect your laptop with the device.2. It'll convert the display to 1080p which results over sharpened over saturated + dark visual on TV.3. You should have TV remote in your hand always to control volume. Because the device will play audio even the laptop is in Mute. Volume control in Laptop won't change volumen in TV. Ideally Audio should be enabled only in TV when connected. I use Audio Cable + VGA Cable which gives good clarity and Audio passed to TV. Also If I mute in Laptop it'll mute in TV. When the audio cable is plugged, Audio won't play in Laptop but in TV.4. The WiDi application will always remain in open state. It won't minimize to System.  If you close the application, it'll disconnect.5. I purchased separate HDMI cable But when I received this product, short HDMI cable also provided. It's not mentioned clearly in Product Description.6. Need separate power supply. Make sure you have Power socket for this device.Will be replaced by Chromecast Very Soon."
2725,"Great Kindle case but price is outlandish! They also don't come in enough true colors. Was not aware that ran off Same Kindle power source so that because of the light usage, the Kindle needs to be charged more often. The light definitely covers the entire screen without glare so that's a plus. You decide."
2726,"We have had this TV for over a year now. It's a good TV, but there are some things that really bug me. (note: this may be the case on most TVs. I have not recently compared it to others.)120hz/clearmotion or whatever they call it:I should not have bothered with a 120hz tv. It makes everything look like it was filmed on a soap opera studio. It works fine, and looks good for sports, but it makes movies look very unrealistic. To me, movies and tv look better in 60hz without any fancy effects applied.Smart features:While it might be nice that you can watch Netflix or stream videos over the network directly to your TV, we never use it because the interface is extremely slow and looks like it was made 15 years ago. We use our AppleTV instead.Gaming:I am a console gamer. (First xbox 360, now PS4) I play mostly first-person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield. It is nice that there is a game mode (it basically removes any effects the TV applies, to reduce lag as much as possible.) While this helps a lot, its not enough. I think the input lag is too much for serious FPS gaming. There is a noticeable delay between the controller and the screen, and its enough to mean life or death (in game). I think it would be fine for some games that don't require quick/precise movements, but it just does not work for me. I gave up playing FPS games on this TV, and ended up setting up my own gaming station with a computer monitor.All-in-all, we're happy with it for watching movies and TV, but probably would have been just as happy with any basic 60hz TV."
2727,This drive plays discs just fine but is pretty noisy when the disc is spinning.  If you're looking for a quiet drive then this is not the drive for you.
2728,"For the price, I can't complain.  This case lasted about a year under heavy usage before needing to be replaced."
2729,"I replaced an older Linksys router with this model and as far as your basic setup-and-go router, this one is pretty good.  Installation was painless with the CD, however I don't like that you really MUST use the CD to set it up.  Apparently, if you make too many changes to the router via the webpage, it breaks your ability to use the CD with it again.  I'm not a fan of installing software I'll never use, and that is one star off for this router right there.My bigger beef is basically that the router lacks some of the very useful advanced options.  For example, there is no easy way to see who is connected to the router (list of IPs, MACs or device names, etc).  I have several wireless cameras along with iPods and computers, but the DHCP list shows two devices, and that list is extremely well hidden in the menu structure.There is no way to manually set the MTU, so optimizing your WAN speed is not possible.And, the bigger issue is when you setup port routing (for my weather cams, phone server, etc), the DHCP server always changes the IP addresses, rendering the port forwarding useless.  You can't assign port forwarding by MAC address, which would be very nice.  So when you reboot the router or the power goes out, you have to hunt around dozens of possible IP addresses to find your devices and fix the port forwarding table.  This is a pretty lame issue for a Cisco-based router considering my older D-Link and Actiontech routers are much more sophisticated for 1/2 the price!My work around for the above ""bug"" is to set the affected devices to static IP with a local address... this removes the router's ability to release/reassign the IP address every couple days.But if you don't need all the fancy stuff, you will likely enjoy this router.  It's very attractive and low profile.  WiFi range is okay - not great (we have a 1000 sq ft house and it works fine in here by at the driveway I have a weak signal).  If you have a huge house, you may need to consider a router with a more powerful WiFi transmitter, or a repeater."
2730,"I wanted someting cheap that would protect my new iPad on a music stand. This one does the job. Like others have written, I was was surprised at how it does fit loosely around the edges and gives off a undistinctive look. I have a number of covers for my iPad first gen (that won't fit the new one), that look awesome...this one looks cheap.However, if you want to disguise your iPad and protect it, like me, this is perfect for the occasion."
2731,"This is some of the most deluxe, upscale, impressive packaging I've seen for a piece of plastic of dubious value.  You can't beat the price (and with killer apps like ""TuneIn Radio"" going for zero dollars it's easy to see why this device from Gigaware is being sold at a steep discount).  Moreover, included with the dongle are not one but two downloadable apps! One is for tuning the radio; the other is a comprehensive (but far from complete) listing of HD stations in the user's area as well as a catalog of more sophisticated (and functional) HD radios from manufacturers like Insignia.My guess is that the app was created by a manufacturer like Insignia to ""spread the word"" about a product that was all but doomed to obsolescence from the start.  The accompanying notes even refer to the Gigaware App as a kind of ""novice's toy,"" a marginally functional introduction to a radio of much better quality (unfortunately, HD radios--by Insignia, Sony, or any other manufacturer--are no longer available except on close-out or as used radios).  The revolution that made ""internet sound"" as acceptable to most listeners' ears as any HD or non-compressed audio signal spelled the end for HD radio.As for the dongle and apps, unlike other users I had no immediate success getting any sort of signal with it on my older iPod Touch (it's usable only with the previous generation dock-connector iPod).  I was impressed that the device sensed my location, but in looking at the recommended HD stations in my area, I saw no mention of the 3-channel HD station--WGTD--in my home town!  Whether or not that omission extends to the actual operational limits of the device I simply can't say.  It's also unclear to me whether this small tuning device is intended to function as an authentic HD radio or as merely an internet radio being used to sell the promise of HD radio to young people unfamiliar with this now-obsolete technology.It's nothing worth returning or reselling.  Or writing about (I'm doing so while answering ""Trick or Treat"" calls at my front door). I almost regret tossing away the packaging more than this device with an thoughtless name--""Gigaware.""  It's neither a storage device or a useful utensil, and it's not very ""aware"" of HD signals, far or near."
2732,its bigger and bulkier then i expected i kind of dont like how big it is and had to get another case for more permanit place
2733,"For the most part, my conversions are the ""simple"" type.  I have a Word document and want to convert it to .pdf. . . or. . vice-versa.  I wasn't looking for anything ""fancy"".

2734,I'm not married to any one brand of memory. My first Kingston has lasted years without problems. I suspect this will do the same.
2735,"The device is relatively small and light. It will sit nicely on a table or bookshelf and it looks quite good and unobtrusive. It also feels pleasing to the touch, very soft and smooth if that's important to you.I tried the iphone setup first and it could not have been easier, the manual has very easy to follow directions. You go into the bluetooth set up feature on the iphone/ipod and make it discoverable, press and hold the pair button on the Altec speakers, hey recognize each other and you're all set. This device is not a dock, it's better than that. once paired, whatever sound program you choose will play through the Altec speakers. I used the obvious itunes to great effect but it also worked great with the Pandora, Tunein Radio and audible.com apps.  I walked to every corner of my house. even upstairs and outside into the garage with my phone in hand and the sound quality never faltered. I'm no speaker sound quality connoisseur but it sounded pretty good to me. There was some distortion at the very loudest setting, which i'd rarely use anyway so that didn't bother me too much but i did think at the time that it might not work great for outdoor parties. I'll have to throw one and let you know how it performed. When paired with an Iphone/ipad the sound can be controlled by one of three ways. You can press the buttons directly on the Altec, use the included remote control or you can control it from the ipod/iphone, which adds to the versatility. I'm very happy with the iphone pairing function. it really couldn't be easier.However my attempts to connect the Altec to my home computer and stream my itunes through it did not go so smoothly. Again, the instructions are simple and easy to follow and by all appearances from the indicator lights my imac and the altec were successfully paired, but the sound came through my imac not the altec. I tried again many times with no success. It was only when I decided to bypass the usb dongle thing and pair the Imac with the speakers the same way as i did the Iphone via bluetooth. Success! Finally! There may be some simple work around setting that I don't know about but i followed the setup instructions to the letter multiple times and it did not work. I didn't want to waste my time googling the solution. The streaming from home computer seems to be effortless for some reviewers so its possible that i either got a faulty USB dongle, or i'm doing something wrong but since I found a work around I'm not too concerned about it. I plan to use it for ipod/iphone streaming exclusively anyway but because of the frustration involved in that part of the setup I had to bump it down a star."
2736,"Just wanted to let you know that this cover looks like Apple cover for Ipad 1, (I had one, worked good) but this one is not exact fit for Ipad 2 as it said.first think it slide out and and have to push it in regularly, in this case its starting to fall a part."
2737,"Overall I like this laptop. This is well build, feels robust, fast and very light.However, I am very disappointed by the mouse pad. I was eager to play with the multi-touch. My girl friend has a MacBook Pro and her touch pad is just amazing with the multi-touch.Unfortunately, the multi-touch on the Lenovo is just garbage... For example with the 2 fingers scrolling, it is not responsive, doesn't do anything when I move slowly or scroll directly to the top/bottom of the page when I move just a little too fast. This is just unusable to me... This just amazes me to see Lenovo putting such an unfinished feature on the market... Thankfully I do not mind using the track point but I am very disappointed... I took 2 stars off because of the poor experience.That might very well be my last Thinkpad..."
2738,"I purchased this keyboard for my new set up at my house and it was working great, despite the 'G' key. Every time I would press the 'G' key it would output a 'B' as well. I contacted the seller and they were not very helpful about the return due to their policy. To have returned it through them would have been more hassle than helpful. So in turn I contacted Microsoft to discuss the malfunction, by this time other keys had just stopped working all together, and they informed me that this is a package piece that only comes with a mouse. This seller(Galactics) or any other seller offering this keyboard alone is purchasing this product splitting them and selling them, due to the way they store the products until they ship them I believe this and being shipped outside of the original package loosely placed in another box caused the issues. I received a replacement from Microsoft, who generously sent me the original business 2000 package with mouse, which now it works amazingly!! The keyboard and mouse that come with this package are amazing quality, just insure if you receive them they are in original packaging and not tampered with."
2739,"Okay, so the best thing about this is that it does it's basic function... it protects the keyboard.Also, it has a couple more pluses:-it's a really bright orange, WHICH IS AWESOME.-I ordered this cover as well as another cover. The other one's edges are too big, and my fingers get stuck and pull it back. THIS ONE's edges are a lot smaller and, as a whole, fit the keyboard MUCH better.I only really have 2 issues:-The material is so thin, that when it clings to the keyboard, the orange has to compete with the mac's black keys that try to show through. So, then, the color isn't such a brilliant orange.-The writing on the cover doesn't match up with the keys. Therefore, the light on the keyboard doesn't show through really well...and I like that light shining through.... but that's more of a personal preference, I guess."
2740,"When I first opened the package was dissapponted in the size, I guess I should  have read the description more closely but it is a tiny stylus. I have  found myself relying onto the cap to hold it in my hand properly. The cap is my second gripe with this product, why have a detachable cap when it doesn't fit over the tip for protection? That was one of the features that grabbed me when I was shopping around, but the caps only use is to add some length to the pen, but it's becoming frustrating because it keeps popping off while I work with it.Other than those two issues the functionality and responsiveness is great, I was concerened about getting another rubber tipped stylus because they normally leave smuges on the screen and eventually rub the wrong way, not to mention the short lifespan they have. This tip works great, it slides across the screen with ease without leaving smuges or marks. Although I've only used it for a few days so I can't comment on its durability just yet. It has a nice weight and doesn't feel cheap at all.I just wish it was longer to make using it more comfortable and natural."
2741,This little guy is fine for easy bluetooth connection...but it lacks the handy feature of being able to act as an outgoing audio connection.  The older Nokia unit had a switch and four RCA jacks for stereo in or stereo out.  Its such a simple thing.  Why can't Logitech get it right?
2742,"When compared to &#34;Airplay,&#34; bluetooth audio quality is noticeably poorer. I am not an audiophile but I can hear the difference. Also the range is poor. Sometimes the signal breaks up when I place my phone 12ft away from the receiver. I was expecting better."
2743,"Again, there is not free lunch, these batteries are prices much less then the OEM Canon batteries, and there is a reason for it: Do not expect the same battery life as the Canon ones. this will be about half of the life. but still great back up batteries."
2744,"Bargain, but it does drop the connection from time to time. It's paired with an Onkyo receiver downstairs and my wireless hub is upstairs, so that's causing the occasional drop outs. For the price and ease of hook up its worth trying."
2745,"Um, there's a strap across the screen.  Yeah, for real.A strap.Across the screen.It blocks the view.Of the screen.A strap.Hello?"
2746,"I bought this modem because I got a letter from Comcast Business saying I had to upgrade my modem or get D/C'd at the end of the year. I pulled out my bills and noted that we pay 120/year rental for the SMC modem so why not buy my own for 68.00 bucks? So I got it fast from this seller, contacted Comcast to register it, waited 3 days for Comcast to contact me back letting me know it was registered and I preceded to set up the modem and it worked fine with a dynamic IP address but as soon as I set my static IP it disconnected. I called Comcast at which point they thought it pertinent to share that I can't use my own modem if I have a static IP. Didn't bother to tell me that when I called to register and no where on their approved equipment page does it say you can't use your own modem with a static IP.I hope all business owners see this review before wasting your time like I did. =("
2747,They were as described on the Web Page. They installed easy and seem to protect the screen pretty well. I would purchase them again!!
2748,"I have bough several of these, my friends saw mine and wanted for themselves, so one of them came DOA, too cheap to file a complaint, they have good angle, all my hood, the quality has HD and SD I use it on SD(640x480), and it can read plates about 6 yards close, so only when you are on a red light, still, it could help a lot in other moments. if you buy this cam, you get what you pay for."
2749,"Obviously I should have checked it before, but I did not and when I received the bag I was surprised how heavy it is. I guess that's due to the quality of the materials used, indeed they seem very good and so far it seems a very well finished product, but when when you have to carry the thing a whole day and you start adding all the stuff that you can load it with (and trust me, you can load a great bunch of it) you will feel it in your shoulder."
2750,"I held out for a while to buy another iMac. The last one I had bought in 2007 was limping along sadly and highly suicidal. He repeatedly tried to end it completely (death by hard drive failure) and I had to use an external hard drive to use as the computer's hard drive. That would have been great except for the fact that the external hard drive wasn't up for the task and had a very public meltdown, taking all my precious files with it. Cloud storage anyone?Hopefully the latest iMac won't make me endure a similar fate. It's hard to imagine that the computer--light years of improvement in every way from the 2007 model--wouldn't also be able to hold on to its hard drive a bit longer.This machine is absolutely brilliant. It's not completely different than the older model, but it's so much faster and more capable. Tasks that would crash the programs in my suicidal machine are welcomed with open gigabytes on my new one. I like to have 10029 tabs open on my Firefox browsers and that was a big no-no until I got a modern machine. The main improvement is the operating system. Apple likes to force you to buying the new operating system by cutting off updates (even security updates) to older OSs. Now that I have the new OS X, I can get updates and manage my iPod and everything else. I feel like a new man.Drawbacks: Apple, being a slave to industrial design that they are and unabashed promoters of their proprietary systems only gave the new iMacs thunderbolt and USB jacks in addition to the ethernet. No firewire, so theBelkin Thunderbolt Express Dockmay be useful. Also, there is no DVD drive, so you may have to get an external drive for that or try to use your PC's drive to play movies from the 20th century (I'm still trying to get this to work).All in all, an excellent purchase. I hope it will last longer than 6 years this time.*** Update: well, it didn't last 6 years. It didn't even last 6 months before the screen conked out. I did some research and it looks like a common failure of the LG screens. There's even a class action suit because the screen fails right after warranty. Luckily, mine was still under warranty. It's still annoying and worrisome when the end of the warranty is here."
2751,"Although I thought the LunaTik seemed a bit on the expensive side, when I got to see it in person, the expense seemed totally justified.The band is very well made, and it blends flawlessly with the iPod nano -- there were no gaps or uneven areas anywhere. It was truly impressive.Unfortunately, the band just didn't fit my wrist. I'm about 6'1"" and I think my hands and wrists are pretty average-sized. However, I could only get this to go on the second to last notch. Because the band is so thick and uses a retaining post, that didn't leave enough excess to be able to use the post. So, it just left a big piece of rubber sticking out, demolishing the form and function of the band.If the band had just been a tiny bit larger, I'd be in love with it."
2752,"Well, I received the item and was excited to try out the product. So I placed my SB700 flash on one unit, and the other one was in the hot shoe of my D80.There is one major drawback, and that has to do with flash sync. With these triggers in place it drops the flash sync speed. So shooting at 1/200 shutter speed will cause issues, you will see a slight dark line at the bottom of the photo. If you reduce your shutter speed to 1/160 this issue goes away. This is not a major issue for me, but it could be. Also for such a cheap product I do not mind that as long as it works upto that speed.The range of the product is good, and for the most part it will fire the flash, there have been a few times where it did not, maybe like 2 times in every 100, again, not a major deal breaker.The really annoying issue I have with these triggers is like what every one else says, the on/off switch is too near the flash, so you cannot switch it on or off if the flash is in place. Yongnou needs a customer user experience manager or something.Overall, I would have give it a 4 stars, but sticking to 3 stars due to the flash sync issue."
2753,The quality is fair but the format and key placement of the keys is very weird for any qualified typist.
2754,"Took this tripod to the parade and it was a joy to carry around because of it's weight.  I would not want to use this on a regular basis and certainly not in a rough terrain situation.  Tripod is very light and not real sturdy on uneven ground, tends to tip with just the weight of my Nikon D3100 w/50 mm lens.  Ok for sidewalks and tarred areas but would not use it in a woods setting.  I would carry my heavy tripod instead."
2755,"Somehow I thought that this would fit the Rebel t4i because the camera is quite close to the 60D in its specs. However the screen protectors are about 1/8"" larger in both height and width and would not adhere properly without being cut down. And there is the rub. It is nearly impossible to cut the screens down to the exact size to fit. This must also be done before the protecting layers are removed or a tremendous amount of dust will be introduced. This was a problem for me and I will have to buy another product that will fit the t4i without cutting. If it is not placed entirely upon the LCD with not a mm of overlap with the border, then air gets under the edge and the seal is incomplete. I can see that if these screens are applied carefully to the right camera, it is a very good item to have."
2756,"I thought this was an ungraded non-OEM drive ... but it is not. The software included is for drive writing - no BlueRay software is included. I was confused so now hoepfully you will read this and know the facts. Still, a bit noisy (aren't they all) but works. Downloaded ""trail"" version of software to play some movies and it's works and can rip them."
2757,"...for the Midnight M5010 that this charger is advertised to be used with.Ironically, it seems to work fine on an HP 2000 notebook.I'll rate this a  3 stars since I can justify keeping it (and not dealing with return hassles) for the $8.74,  because at least it would work as a back-up charger for the HP 2000 at need.Though it won't charge the Midnight M5010 as advertised, at least it can be used as a (temporary) power plug, enabling use of the Midnight until a fully functional unit can be found."
2758,"My review is relevant if you are primarily interested in using the tablet to watching movies or TV shows.  Also, I had to contact Samsung technical support, so I can provide a useful example there.  I am fairly Tech Savvy but not amazing, so your mileage my vary.  To summarize, I tried to make this tablet work for me, but ended up buying an iPad.I planned to use a tablet for a couple of things:1) Watching TV shows or movies at the gym2) Watching TV shows or movies on an airplane3) Occasional casual use for web and emailI purchased an Android tablet because I wanted to be free of the Apple DRM protected video monster and the general idea of using Google/Samsung products sounded appealing.  I opted to go with a Samsung tablet so that I could use their Media Hub software to purchase TV shows, etc.It took me quite a few hours to set up the tablet and get started using it.  I had to download software updates, register, update other things, etc.  The whole process took several hours before it was ready to use.  Note that some of the software (Samsung stuff such as Media Hub and Swype) that was allegedly ""included"" did not come on the tablet as I received it, though it was available when I went through the couple hours of updates.  Overall, I was reasonably pleased with the tablet initally and it seemed remarkably similar to the iPad, just a little less polished.I have numerous movies that I have copied from my DVD collection and made into MP4 (for my iPhone) or WMVs (to stream through my Xbox).  I attempted to copy some of these to my new Galaxy, but they were taking over 1 hr/ea to transfer because it had to re-convert the video files for some reason, despite that they were already in a format the device could allegedly play.I figured there was more than one way to skin a cat, so I would try to download from the Samsung Media Hub, which had been influential in my purchase decision.  After I went through the hassle of registering with the slightly janky program (compared to iTunes), I purchased a couple of episodes of a TV show that I wanted to watch.  The shows never downloaded, instead just giving me errors when I tried to download.At this point, I was going on a long trip in a short amount of time and just wanted a tablet that worked.  I decided to return the Galaxy and buy an iPad.  Company A was phenomenal about the return as always, btw.I ended up contacting Samsung customer support to get a refund for the shows that they charged me for but never delivered.  Tech support was AWFUL and I felt really, really good about my decision to return the Galaxy after my interaction with them.  They were completely unhelpful, slow to respond to anything, and primarily seemed to be interested in frustrating me enough that I would give up.  I continually provided them with my information but they told me that they couldn't locate me and that I should try back at another time.  They certainly didn't have any trouble locating my credit card number.  For comparison, one time my iTunes froze and I somehow unintentionally purchased a show that I didn't want.  They immediately refunded my money with no questions, no hassle.I would stay away from the Galaxy if you plan to use it to watch movies unless you are very technically knowledgeable and willing to deal with lots of frustrations, or are illegally downloading shows that are exactly the format that the Galaxy will play without taking hours to transfer."
2759,Purchased this device to help with the migration from HDD to SSDs on multiple systems. We tried to use this with several different versions of disk cloning software and could not get the drives to be properly recognized using the USB3 ports but no problem on USB2.0 ports. This unfortunately makes the copy process slower as you are limited to 40MB/s. As long as you are cloning a 2.5 drive (HDD or SSD) you don't need to use the included power adapter but it's nice to know you have it for those 3.5 occasions
2760,"This unit wasn't packaged very well and was scratched on the surface and the box was flimsy and looked like it was dropped off a 5 story building.  All the items were there except the instructions.  Had to go to YouTube to find out how to put it together.  I haven't used it yet, but so far I'm not impressed."
2761,Not much to say it works well it fits flush in my express card slot. The only issue I have with it is not really a problem with the device itself. usb plugs connect very snug and you have to hold the card in when you disconnect or it comes out.
2762,"Good purchase, worked well except NO OWNER MANUAL.  I tried to find an owner manual in-line, but could NOT find any.Confusing on when battery is charged."
2763,"I expect to protect 100% of the screen, not only the optical view. The promotion must say 80% satisfaction guaranteed"
2764,"This is a leather case plus keyboard for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 inch screen.  It looks great and fits perfectly although it does seem a little heavy as the keys are flexible and probably weigh a little too much.  All those are relatively trivial issues, though.My ""biggest"" problem is that the keyboard loses its bluetooth connection at least 50% of the time when restarting from the ""sleep"" mode - which is a real annoyance.  So much so that I have stopped using it.I'm back to ""typing"" on the screen - which is relatively easy on this size screen."
2765,easy to use. Good quality. You get what you pay for. But these were a good deal for the price. I would buy them again.
2766,"Otherwise, the first time I used it, it operated as promised. It had god sound from the computer iTunes and worked fine with my telephone. But it would not recharge properly. It now will charge only enough for about fifteen minutes of use.I am going to try and replace the battery, but ti is so delicate of a design that my efforts may ruin the product, so I keep putting it off.A note here: A policeman friend of mine has one and loves it; he uses it all day while on duty."
2767,all things considered. Great product. Love the use of it. I am hoping any one that buys this will feel the same as myself. No issues
2768,One must read the year of Apple Mac Book Pro that this fits in the description. Ours was not correct.
2769,"This cover is great but has it's down sides like:The camera is slightly covered, to charge it you have to leave the case open.. annoying.The stand is good for holding up the tablet."
2770,thought it would come with its own cord but it doesn't.  Also have to remove my case any time I want to use it
2771,"The projector is surprisingly bright and small for the size and weight. I bought this projector when it first came out.The internal image / video viewer is garbage, and you are best to use a Roku or Google Chromecast to send an image to the projector. Now they have two smaller models with a brighter lumen lamp (550 - 750 lumens vs 500 originally).The fan is a bit noisy if you have a small room. It also gets fairly hot. If you leave it on too long eg. 4 hours +, it may crash and or shut off the lamp. You have to unplug and replug the power cable to reboot the projector.They claim 20,000 plus lamp life. However, mine has died after 4,000 hours or so. When I turn mine on, the lamp is extremely dim, and unfortunately it looks like Optoma doesn't sell lamp replacements!The resolution is 1280x800 resolution, 16:10 ratio. The RGB pattern is diamond shaped. You cann't really see the pixels until you project at 50 inches or more.Another con is the projector doesn't have analog keystoning or analog zoom to resize the throw of the image. There is only a focus ring that is directly in front of the lens. Fortunately, the newer models have an improved rocker arm for focusing.3D DLP only works with active shutter glasses that work off a reflected IR signal from the projector to the wall to the glasses. It syncs as long as the IR signal makes it to your glasses. Also, the 3D only works over VGA cable. NOT HDMI. This is a major limitation if you want to use NVIDIA 3D on your PC. NVIDIA doesn't support VGA 3D. You have to hack some software to make it work with video. It's practically not worth it in my opinion.At the $650 price I paid at the time, it was a good deal (if the lamp lasted and didn't crash) I liked it when it worked.At this point, I would spring for the $800-900 projectors with replaceable lamps, more lumens, 1080p resolution and 3D over HDMI.I would only go for the newer, smaller ML550 or ML750 if you are a road warrior and need a really small, light projector. In this role, I can see it being useful."
2772,This is a great tablet. I use it mostly for E reading. I would like it much much better if the WEBos system on it was updated once in a while. Not being able to play new games or update the facebook app is disappointing.
2773,"I got mine at a firesale and decided to try it out. I've read about most of the tablets, played with a Xoom and ipad1&2 before, so I expected to be able to a pretty comparable device. Well, I was sad (but not surprised) to find that is not the case. After a lot of frustration and fiddling around with it I have figured out a good workflow and some do's and don'ts. Below are a few caveats I've found:1.) upgrade the OS in Settings. Install Preware via QuickInstaller (it should be free, don't pay $0.99 from that one site for it). Install a bunch of patches to it. Youtube and other sites have good video/articles on what to do, just google ""optimize hp touchpad.""2.) Even though this thing has a dual core 1.2Ghz cpu it behaves like an iphone 3G on iOS4, or something from the age of windows 95. Taps are not always responsive, sometimes it can take a few seconds for it to register a touch. Other times it will not register at all, forcing you to either wait a long time before trying again or tapping multiple times and have it spaz out on you a few seconds later.3.) It tends to switch orientation on you on a whim and is much too sensitive. It also delays before transitioning so you may find yourself switching to portrait when you have it horizontal, wait for what seems forever and have it do nothing, only then back to landscape after you tilt it again.4.) Playing Flash, which it can do fine, has its limitations. First, youtube will only play Flash on this device (no HTML5), that means everytime you tap on the video to change volume, skip forward/backward, you will end up pausing the video. There is no ""mouseover"" with touch interface so that is an annoyance. Second, skipping through videos will often result in 5-15 seconds of video freeze (but at least the audio keeps playing) until it figures out how to keep playing. God help you if you try to pause/play or skip around again during that time. Also, don't try to switch to another window while a video is playing, it may or may not crash or video freeze on you.5.) Some apps are just a bit slow. The Kindle app, should you leave the fancy page turning effects on, animates at maybe 5 fps. A lot of animations, in fact, are slideshow slow. Epicurious, a great recipe app, will randomly not respond to touches. This usually does not happen on other apps like the browser. The keyboard will also randomly go away as you try to switch between text fields, or even if you do nothing at all. I have also experienced Angry Birds crashing during loading or soon after it loads, forcing a reboot (seriously? Way to take me back to win 95).So with the caveats out of the way, what is this thing good for? It's fine for some casual browsing. I can read comics on it without too much hassle. There's a nice facebook app once you ignore the choppy animation and fidgety touch recognition. Chat is decent. Mail is actually pretty nice. The multitasking feature: cards, is really slick. It's easily better than iOS or Android. It is super easy to close programs (though they're not really closed, but at least when you open it back up it's faster the second time around). Switching cards within a stack takes some getting used to, as you have to tap and hold for a few seconds, wait for it to turn transparent, before you can rearrange it within the stack.I have gone through the usual grind of optimizations: update to the latest OS, reboot a few times, turn off logging, enabled dev mode, installed preware and a bunch of patches. I'm holding off the overclocking for the time being. But having done all of that, much of the time animations are not liquid smooth and touch gestures aren't always recognized. I'm glad I bought it for the discount price, as the tablet form factor is a joy to use, but the grind this device puts the user through is hard to bare and for $500 or even $250 it's a lot to ask for from the consumer.At least Android should be ported to this thing soon."
2774,"Bought these umbrellas because they would be easy to set up and take down in a remote shoot location as opposed to my soft boxes.  When I received them I found one of them had a slight tear.  It still opened and stayed expanded properly.  I decided to live with it due to time constraints and not wanting to risk not getting a replacement in time for my shoot.  As far as diffusing light, they work fairly well.  I needed to do some adjustments to my light intensity but that was expected.  Overall light is even and pleasant.  For the money spent, they are a decent value."
2775,"As far as a crimper goes, it really is sub-par.  The RJ45 connections don't lock in when you are crimping, and when you do crimp down it also pushes the clip down with it, making it weaker.  It does get the job done though and the yellow stripper that came with it was a bonus.  For $6, I got what I expected."
2776,Causes snow in TV picture while using Dish TV.  Support was no help.  Watching DVD is great with nice sound and volume.
2777,"Lenovo Z580 with Intel graphics & i5 CPU, LED backlit display.Computer geek and well-read on color management and calibration.Intel driver settings were at full default, all color calibrations done through Windows Color Management Calibration software removed from the c:\windows\system32\... directory and system reboot and verified at stock prior to installing and running this.Installed the driver, plugged in the ColorMunki Display, ran through the basic calibration at 6500k (matching color temp of HDTV), gamma 2.2, no auto ambient compensation. Brightness set at 2nd down from max (about 130 lux or whatever it was measuring vs. ideal of 120. 3rd down from max would have been about 102.).As I've seen before, the display went 'warm' - which means everything has a yellow/orange hue to it. This mis-calibration has occured before using other 'monitor calibration' hardware on other systems/monitors, so it wasn't a big surprise (but no idea as to why some hardware combos calibrate nicely; others don't). Definitely nowhere near accurate - even next to a Photodisc test target printed and viewed under high CRI lamps, not even close to matching the print.Took everything out. Sat the computer next to an IPS Panasonic TV (I'm trying to calibrate for video, so obviously, all modern HDTVs are calibrated to match the 6500k Rec709 standard, though most require some added calibration and tweaks for the very best accuracy). Hooked up a Hauppage WinTV950 to the laptop. Set both on the same HD TV channel. Ran through the Windows Color Calibration by hand, didn't touch gamma or brightness (at 2nd down from brightest), Adjusted the blue channel until the grays and faces matched. Yes, things were 'warmer' than default (too cold/blue), but nowhere as bad as the ColorMunki calibration.Videos and photos (Photodisc test target) now both look very realistic and accurate (vs. Photodisc test target especially, but matching the HDTV quite well despite the smaller color gamut of the Z580's TN screen). Far better than what the Munki achieved.Is this broadcast Rec709/6500k accurate? Keep in mind the problems here. The IPS panel likely displays close to or at least the full Rec709 color space - the TN panel on the Z580 is likely going to display 50-70% at best. Even after 'perfect' calibration, the TN panel will still not 'look just like' the ideal Rec709 color space monitor since many of the colors can't even be displayed on the TN panel. However, the eye is very good at distinguishing minor color differences across a wide range of video material when both are side by side, so hand-calibrating the TN panel against the IPS TV will put the Z580 at a 'decent' starting point for viewing and editing videos without spending $$$ (which would actually require one to buy at least the Y580 which has an IPS panel with larger color gamut). Additionally, the Rec709 is for most intents, same as the sRGB space, so when comparing the monitor against a printed Photodisc test target, if both match well in addition to the TV, then the eyeballed calibration is pretty 'good' for the basics of video editing.The Z580 is running a touch unsaturated at the default calibration done this way, so a +5 Saturation in the Intel drivers bring back a bit of the 'pop' one expects, especially when watching movies like Star Trek Into Darkness.Is the Colormunki good for anything? Not sure - didn't do it out of the box here, and there's no point tweaking and going through zillions of trials just to get a 'better' calibration. One simply doesn't know even with all that tweaking done is the calibration 'accurate' against what we're trying to target? Didn't match the Photodisc test target printed as accurately as eyeballing the calibration through Windows, and definitely things look at whole lot better with the latter than using the Colormunki profile. (eg. even playing a slew of videos from Star Trek Into Darkness to 24, it's easy to see which of the color calibrations is the 'best and most accurate' - A/B'ing using the Windows Color Mgmt window to switch between default, eyeball calibrated, and ColorMunki calibrations)"
2778,"Good non accelerated sensor inside with a relatively high perfect control rate that fits well with low dpi users and high dpi users alike. I'm personally not a fan of the grip anymore after having used the Deathadder and Intellimouse 3.0 and similar shaped mice. If you liked the MX518 or G5 and want a replacement mouse for that, look no further."
2779,"I have been using a Philips O'Neill The Stretch Scratch headset, and think that it is awesome. When I got this headset I expected it to be the same. Sadly, this headset does not match up to the excellence of the other. The first thing that I notice was that the sound quality was not as good as those others. To make matters worse, this one is nowhere near as good at keeping out ambient noise.However, I do need to be careful here. Just because these do not match up to another, more expensive, headset does not mean that this is a bad one. In point of fact, this is not a bad headset, and it is handy to have around. The sound quality is good, and the headset is of a nice rugged design, which is nice if you have children...who definitely will want to play with them.(Review of Philips O'Neill The Stretch headset)"
2780,"Motion-Activated Mini Spy Camera with Night Vision and 10-Day Battery LifeThis is a generic Motion-Activated Camera with Night Vision. Have not used it for 10 days straight yet because I used it for 12 hours and the battery ran out.I assumed it was user error because there is no way to tell if the battery is fully charged! I plan to charge it over night and try again...Also don't waste your money on a 32gb memory card because the camera over writes the old files anyways.A 8gb is enough to where the battery will run out (10 days on standby) before the card is full. (a 32gb card if the camera is always plugged in)According to the user manual, 7mb for a 30 sec video for 10 days will not exceed 8gb. At which point you will have to charge the camera anyways.Calls for a Micro SD card class 6 or higher so avoid the common class 4 cards that are always on sale...Only complaints: When the subject is close to the camera the IR lights over expose them, the detection is on average 2-4 seconds before recording starts, the IR light and blinking light on the front are obvious in the dark.Quick fix: put the camera further away or higher up, aim the camera in advance of where the subject will be so the camera sensor can detect them and by the time recording starts they will be entering the frame, obvious lights: black marker on the IR lights and some electrical tape over the blinking light.UPDATE 4/25/2012: The battery lasts about 8-10 days after a full charge. Then the life of the battery diminishes to about 4-5 days after a few recharges. I have two units, both are having same battery issues!"
2781,"This model of Lumix comes with a design flaw in which the flash is not high enough and the lens might cast a shadow on the pictures. This is a big factor if you are shooting in the dark or other flash-required environment. Yet, if taking flash out of the equation the picture resolution and other features are awesome."

2783,"it's essentially network attached storage. it works fine as that, it's SLOW, and usually works, but it's useless as a router. it's huge, heavy and old. buy something cheaper and FASTER if you're using it as NAS."
2784,3 stars because it didn't have hardware that was compatible with my Samsung UN55C8000.  I had to mount it to the wall behind the TV instead.  I use the iPhone remote app instead of the Apple TV remote because mounting the ATV behind the TV requires the line-of-sight infrared signal from the remote to bounce off the ceiling.  Finding the sweet spot for the signal bounce can be tricky sometimes.
2785,"I installed this card because when I upgraded my motherboard and it didn't have any IDE ports. I have 2 ASUS DVD burners that use IDE. The burner reads normally but when you try to burn, it fails every time because the it cant use the memory on the drives. Probably the card works fine for hard drives but not for CD/DVD burners. Also when you reinstall or restore windows from a backup image, you have to first install the drivers otherwise the re installation won't proceed. When both IDE drives break, I will replace it with a SATA drive instead."
2786,"I've had a lot of Bluetooth headsets over the years... this like many before work okay.  It has an annoying beeping sound in my ear when in use (even after fully charged), but it gets the job done.  I wouldn't buy another one of this style, but like Samsung products overall.  So I will be looking for another style."
2787,"I was surprised of the quality for  under sixty bucks. Came with a 120mm case fan for rear of case. Has plenty of ventilation options and openings. It works and the is what matters to me. The wires that go to motherboard seem fragile, I was afraid of them breaking on me. Lots of room inside.Nice looking case overall. Good quality for less than forty bucksCons: Standoffs included were bad , also they don't fit in the wholes provided for motherboardI was reading other customers reviews and glad I ordered it well worth itBuy it and be happy"
2788,"I bought this case based on it's USB 3.0 front port and it's abundance of cooling options. It comes with two fans and has pre-drilled options for adding 2x120mm fans on the front panel and another 120mm-140mm fan on the side panel as well as a 140mm fan mount for the top. Its cost was roughly $40.00 and with the added feature of a bottom PSU mount, it seemed ideal for a new build. Well, the front USB 3.0 port is crooked and the interior 3.5"" bays are built from cheap plastic. Mounting the motherboard and using an aftermarket heatsink proved too tall so if you plan on using a more robust heatsink, choose one that has a relatively low profile or it won't fit and will obstruct air flow through the interior."
2789,"Of all the SSD drives and SSD cards I have worked with in my I.T. career since 1995, this is the fastest SSD PCI-Express 4X unit that I have ever built into a system.That said you have to double check that your motherboard will support it and it will have to be your boot drive on most of the setups with it. There is a trick to get the drive to run without being your boot drive, however there is not much point in using this since having this SSD X4 card running in a Raid 0 setup makes this drive so fst you would want it to be your boot drive anyhow.My Asus P8-Z68/Gen3/Deluxe motherboard runs this card perfectly and finally allows me to use the 4X PCI-Express slot on my board that would never be used for any other reason.This card is about the same speed as my 2 Crucail M4 SSD drives running in a Raid 0 config. Of course the great thing about this unit is that it will use the banwidth of the 4X PCI-Express slot, instead of forcing you to use your two main sata 3 ports.Of course this Unit is very fast and will mimic a SCSI device in your P.C. and the card itself runs in a Raid 0 config, which is a good thing and a bad thing.The good thing is getting some real speed out of that PCI-Epress X4 slot with unreal speeds. The negative side is that you can't run two of them in a Raid 0 config since they are already setup in a raid 0 config.It would be really nice if OCZ could release a card that you could quad stripe for unreal speeds. The second negative thing about this card is the controller used with it. The sandisk controller is known to be very finicky and cause a lot of headaches for people that don't know how to update the firmware right out of the box.In my current setup I decided not to buy this card based on it's very expensive price. I have seen it at $199.00 and know it's selling for over $299.00. So as it stands right now I would wait for the next generation cards to be released.Not just for the price to drop, but for the new propriatory controller that is a copy of the Marvel controller used in the Crucail M 4's use. OCZ just uses a slightly modified version of that controller called the Indelinix. However this controller is not being used in the PCI-Express SSD cards.So when the price drops and the controller is changed, I'll go a head and purchase one of these very fast cards. Until this happens I will stick with my 2 Crucail M 4's in a raid 0 config. These 2 128 gig SSD's give me read speeds in excess of 1,000 meg per sec. and writes of over 500 meg per sec. at a price of only $200.When they get these drives perfected and get some other companys to force price wars, then I'll bite and pick one up. Until this occurs and they still have a monopoly I'll be waiting until the price drops due some competing drives.Review Note: May 3rd, 2013.  O.K. this drive is no longer worth the unbelievable price they have raised this internal S.S.C. to!!!!! When you have read the above speeds I'm getting with 2 Crucial 128Gig M4's, and how stable they have been running since I wrote the review of this S.S.C., it is just not worth the money unless you have money to burn!"
2790,Great flash drive for the price. It's a good size and has comparable read/write speeds with San-disk and Verbatim flash drives. I do not like how the connector does not slide out smoothly from the body of the flash drive. It has a strong catch that has to be overcome before it will slide out. It does not seem to get smoother after repeated use. Also it does not come with any type of key chain or lanyard.
2791,"I purchased this monitor from the Fry's Electronics Store location in Burbank for my girlfriend back in November of 2013. The monitor works flawlessly every time I go into her apartment. While the monitor is nothing to drool over, She is very pleased. However, keep in mind that before you purchase ASUS monitors, expect to pay the full price. That is the listed price, including the rebate as you will never see the rebate, ever.After butchering the monitor box for the serial number (yes, I like usually like to keep the boxes), I submitted a rebate form in early December and was approved later that month. I was notified that the process will take 8-10 weeks for delivery (were on week 13). I sent numerous emails, contacted ASUS over the phone... and was unable to get a human being on the line. That being said, I'm convinced that my $20 Rebate is nonexistent. In hard times, $20 can go a long way. ASUS has poor customer support for their rebate program and I would seriously advise anyone against this company if they believe they would get a deal that includes a rebate with them.Normally, I would give the monitor four stars. After all, its a decent monitor, but nothing that stands out of the ordinary. Yet, I do have the need to dock three stars due to the manufacturer. Every product that a company produces needs to be backed by the company itself... and I just don't have that here.UPDATE (04/16/14): So, a week after finally getting someone from ASUS, the representative mentioned that American Express handles the handling and shipment of their rebates. When you call American Express your supposed to press 0# three times before getting an operator there. As it turns out, the rebate was returned by U.S. Postal Service. The reason is beyond anyone I contacted... they could not ascertain the reason for the return. Yet, when I check the status of my rebate, it still says ""processed""... no one mentioned the rebate was actually shipped. I guess this is the result from lack of cooperation between ASUS and American Express. So, as of today, I have my rebate! I purchased the monitor in November of 2013... and here in April 2014, I now have my rebate!!!Of course, the monitor is still up and running strong. No complaints yet."
2792,"I used the Jabra Drive this weekend, and have mixed feelings.In my office and home I use a speakerphone for probably 75% of my conversations...it allows me to do other work while talking, to move around, and in general to be productive and attentive.  In a car, I have been using the speaker function of my BlackBerry 8820 for some time,  and haven't been too pleased with the results:  I can usually hear people (albeit with some cutoffs) but people have problems hearing me.The Jabra drive is something of an improvement in voice quality over the speaker function of the BlackBerry, but not that much of one.  As for the unit's speaker, I didn't notice much of an improvement over the BlackBerry's built-in speaker.  In particular, the volume is not that great; forget about using it with an open window.Pros:Reasonable cost (far less than built-in devices)Easy to pair via BluetoothCan play audio sourced from smartphone (albeit in mono)Cons:Volume too lownot hard wired, so the battery will go out eventually (unless you want wires all over your windshield and visor)All-in-all, I might use it for conference calls and other long phone calls, but most of the time I will continue to use the BlackBerry's built-in speakerphone."
2793,"First off I've installed many head units, so installation of this Parrot Asteroid was a snap. Just did a little bit of rewiring to get it installed with my system and away I went. One thing I did appreciate was it's shallow/reduced depth. This made getting all of the wires (both for the HU and auxiliary items) shoved back in place much easier.As for the functionality of the device... I'm not too happy with it.Navigating through the different menus was fairly straight forward and about as simple as can be expected for a HU that isn't touchscreen. The large 3.2'' screen is easy to read even at weird angles. I would have preferred to have the screen in the middle of the unit for easier reading while driving (though you really shouldn't be fiddling with the stereo while driving). This may just be a personal preference.Now the down side is pretty much everything else.The 4x55W MOSFET amplifier while fairly high powered for an HU sounds like it's underpowered and unable to push my speakers (unlike my previously installed Pioneer DEH-P690UB). Keep in mind this is 55W PEAK, not RMS.The included cables for connecting the different devices via USB or stereo are not high quality at all. Flimsy and cheap.The 'apps' are absolutely garbage. Not sure why they even include them.The buttons on the unit feel cheap.And it takes forever to get this sucker up and running and when it is running you're constantly waiting for it to reboot, mess-up, or do something stupid. It's quite frustrating.I think the only real upside to this is that it supports AAC files and can connect with a ton of different devices. But other than that, it's a headache."
2794,"Maybe I'm asking too much, but I'd like all 3 of the cables in a 3-pack to work. The 6' foot worked. The 3"" did not. I tried it on different ports on two known good PCs and iPods. No go. I didn't try the 3' one. I ended up buying a 1m and a 2m iPod cables from Fry's Electronics for $5.99 and $6.99, respectively. The 1m one works.This cable set is going back to Company A..."
2795,"That power connector is pain in the a$$.  For some reason it gets loose over time. When that happens, USB 3.0 devices stop working but USB 2.0 stuff works just fine. That made trouble shooting the first time a difficult. The molex connector may look perfectly well seated but its not. I tried squeezing the PUS's molex connector to give it a tighter fit but that does not seem to help. When it is working, I've gotten 50MB/s out of a Lexar JumpDrive S73 and 90MB/s out of Seagate Backup Plus 4 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA4000100 (all bought from Company A)."
2796,Do the job but it's not really good as I thought  sine the wires can easy to de attach from the card.
2797,"Pros:  The company is excellent and full stands behind its' productCons:  ONLY works if BOTH displays can first be turned off, then one turned on till it stabilizes before turning on the second."
2798,The EZGrabber2 works well but it's software is a little lack luster. I have software installed on my computer that works properly with my night vision so the EZgrabber works well to do what I needed.
2799,These VHS tapes are good but after I got them I realized that I needed more time but this was no fault of the Manufacturer and since they are no longer available it does not matter now.I have found them at another website with more hours.  Now I just have to remember how to use them to my advantage.
2800,"This is cool and all, but I was a little upset when I found out I could buy it at the dollar store for about half the price."
2801,"This cable performed perfectly.  The data transmission speeds were every bit as fast as I had hoped, and the cable was not bothered by being in direct sunlight."
2802,"This product does exactly what its supposed to do. I don't understand people who expected this product to support VOX. It does not say anything about VOX in product description. I personally don't like VOX, because I don't want my children to hear what I'm saying when I fall down while skiing :-).Anyway the product is OK. The only problem for me is a very short wire, that's why I gave it 4 stars."
2803,"I bought these for the price and really did get more than what I paid for.  If you're shooting for looks, you won't get it.  These speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume control...makes for too many wires running  around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension  cords already.  As far as sound goes I thought they were far more than  serviceable.  If you really like to turn it up I would recommend something  a little more powerful, but if you have them in a smaller room and such  they'll do great.  Great price, nice sound, ugly packaging, but a definite  recommendation overall."
2804,"I also own a Sony Mavica and a Kodak DC260 so this isn't my first digital camera. With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care  because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to  just &quot;go for it.&quot; After blowing through several dozen test pics,  I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital  simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera.  The quality of the pictures, once you get the hang of using the camera in a  particular setting, is amazing. This is the highest digital quality I've  experienced with a digital camera."
2805,I use to but this Black on Clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me. The Clear part was really clear - now it's sort of a matte clear but it's OK for most things you put it on.
2806,"Two of my kids have a problem with keeping ear buds in their ears, always being too big for them. They love KOSS 'THE PLUG' IN-EAR HEADPHONES because you can manipulate them into your ear cannel, fitting snug. The only drawback is your earwax tends to cling to them, so they will need to be cleaned."
2807,"I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels, but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one."
2808,"I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel."
2809,"I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet."
2810,"This is officially compatible with DYMO's:- LabelManager 350, 450, PCII- LabelPoint 350- LabelWriter DUOBut it works just fine with the DYMO LabelManager 360D which is not on the list.On this cassette, the tape needed a little bit of 'priming' - had to manually pull about one inch out before anything could come out but all was flawless after that. The output is the expected ultra-crisp black on white and, according to the maker, the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces. In 'real life' the labels stickiness do meet my standards but I'll have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objects.Overall... nice labels.Made in Belgium."
2811,"You will hear consistently that this camera is slow, and to some degree this is true, however, it takes awesome pictures! I've begun to print mine out (even 8x10's) and this camera is just great. With the new price reduction, pick one up. You won't be sorry."
2812,"It's a power strip, not really a lot to say.  I got two of these for a very low price.  Monster products are pretty pricy, however if you get them on sale they are well made, attractive looking, and have been reliable so far for me.  I have several surge protector/power strips from Monster (all purchased at steep discounts from list) as well as some cables.  They all work fine, and the ergonomics are very good."
2813,"I've had no problems at all with my router for about 5 months so far.  I get slick speeds and I've been able to connect a PC, a Mac G4 and a laser printer.  I plan to add another PC soon.My internet provider tried to get me to buy a hub and another IP address (for an additional $10 a month).  I originally thought they could get away with this because the service checked the hardware code on my ethernet card.  That was my biggest stumbling block - once I realized I could ""clone"" my ethernet hardware code on the router (basically change the identifying code of the router to match the ethernet card), everything was perfect...I'd give it 5 stars, but these initial difficulties indicate that it would be helpful to have a tech-nerd around to get it started if necessary."
2814,So it pretty much met my expectations.  This is a pretty standard extension cord with a 1:1 ratio or power in to power out!  I use it outside as it is described.  I have not tried it inside...
2815,"I had another pair of headphones, but in summer my ears would get very sweaty if i wear them, and I hate the ones that you plug in your ears because they hurt after a while in my case. I bought this and they work just fine and the price is right"
2816,love watching and listening to Youtub online the headphones early in the morning ... head phones make it possible while my wife sleeps.
2817,"First of all, the applications available on a palm operating system are great.  And the Visor is a good vehicle to access these apps. -- like the  Palm.  The ONE thing I didn't pick up in my research that MAY be pertinent  is that the Visor requires regular battery replacements.  The Palm (I think  starting with the V) has rechargeable batteries that are juiced by the  synch cradle.  I change my Visor's batteries every 3 weeks.  Maybe no big  deal if you have kids at home (and lots of batteries) but I find it a pain.  Is it a $150 pain?  Probably not.  But I wish I had known . . ."
2818,"I would give it 5 stars if I could use this on my bike that has > 1"" handlebar diameter.  There is no oversize version.I had to cut some of the plastic insert and insert my own to make it fit and not slip.Took a little work to get the screw into the nut (sounds crazy, but yes - it can be a little tricky if not closed flush)."
2819,"Overall it does its job.  I had trouble with it sticking to the cinder block walls, I found an alternative."
2820,"I bought my G6 in December, borrowed a Canon 420 EX speedlite and liked the results but I wondered if the smaller, lighter, less expensive 220 EX would be good enough?  Some of the reviews here say it is underpowered.  Is it?  I bought one to find out and took both out into my backyard in 8 PM darkness to try them at 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet and 40 feet on the G6.Conclusion #1:  The G6 has a good builtin flash.  It makes good images within it's limited range of 5 meters/16 feet (or 4 meters/13 feet when the lens is set to telephoto) and works well as a fill flash.  Complete failure beyond 20 feet.Conclusion #2:  The 420EX (range 24.2 meters) and the 220EX (range 15.7 meters/51.5 feet) both make better images than the builtin flash and both offer longer range.  But both are limited by the autofocus range of 5 to 7 meters.  That's right, neither flash can focus on a subject more than 20 feet away in darkness with the lens set to telephoto.  Both worked fine when the lens was set to wide angle at 40 feet.Final Conclusion:  I'm keeping the 220 EX.  The G6 is small and light, so is the 220EX.  They make a good team, but the G6 also does well alone up close."
2821,"[...]Great product and great price.  Not expensive and does the job.  I am always thwarted by 3'-6' cables.  This is a bit longer than I needed but worth it not to have the hassle with being ""almost long enough"".  Quick ship and didn't break the bank."
2822,This cable is well worth the price. Connected my DirectTV DVR to my computer to enable Video On Demand. Works flawlessly.
2823,Fast shipping. The difference compared to regular pictures wasnt as great as i wished but it certainly reduced a lot of extra glare. Its worth it
2824,"It is a basic filter that works pretty well with my DSLR. Different than film, however. Good quality."
2825,"A must have - I would suggest getting it for all your lenses. Typically they suggest it only for film cameras - for the way UV reacts with the film (typically blue light). However, there are some other schools of thought that suggest not putting cheaper glass in front of expensive lenses.This doesn't feel that way to me - suggest trying it out for yourself and check out the difference on many daytime photos."
2826,"This is permanently on my long lens, and is great.  Good fit, doesn't alter the speed of lens or distance ratio.  Not much more I can say.  order away an don't lose but it does screw on well."
2827,"VERY GOOD PRODUCT, JUST WANT THE LIGHT IS STRONGER IN THE NIGHT, BUT IT WORKS JUST FINE, ORIENTING MYSELF IN HEIGHT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY JOB, I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS AND STILL WORKING GREAT"
2828,"I purchased the Oritron DVD600 as a second player and it works great no problems. I read the reviews listed here and was skeptical about the product, however, for the price I took a chance and have been very pleased. Maybe the products early release had the bugs and have since fixed the problem? I dunno, but once again give it a try I have been pleased and plan to buy another for a christmas present. Oh one other thing, I had read people could not play Disney DVD's well mine plays all Disney DVD's I have including the Dinosoar DVD and has not had a problem on any DVD I have watched, which is about 25 so far, this is what makes me think the newer product is a better product."
2829,"Good headset. Folds into a reasonable size, and adjusts well to fit head. Sound quality in the headphones is good and the microphone has good reception. I use this with a laptop for on-line, voip conference calls. It works very well and no one on the calls has mentioned any issues with the quality of the sound.I use these with a Windows XP setup, and had some trouble getting them to work properly with the plug and play setup. I downloaded drivers from plantronics and have had no issues since. I only plug them in when I am going on a conference call, the usb port picks them up without issue and they work fine.The cord and 'block' are big & get in the way... my only gripe."
2830,"Once I downgraded the firmware (came with 1.40.1 and download was 1.39.2) worked GREAT!!  Good reception throughout my 1000 sq ft condo.  Very cool to sit on my couch, laptop in hand with no cords/cables and be able to surf the net."
2831,"This is big, big, big. If you have gobs of CD's or DVD's this is for you. Highly recommended to anyone"
2832,"I've bought many of the case logic cases.  They're all good cases and all suffer from a zipper that's hard to locate to get it started.  But it's only a minor annoyance.  This case could benefit with a handle since it is large.  But overall, it does what it's supposed to do, very well."
2833,"I was really hoping for a better quality outer shell. The shell is not something I would call leather-like, but better than a plastic shell. Still, for the price, this is a great product and will perform the required functions. One of the pictures shows a removable inner sleeve, the 72 disk version has a fixed &#34;fast-file&#34; 8 disk holder in the front. There is no handle on the spine, but again for the price I can't complain. I love my older Case Logic 48 disk leather wallet like this. I wish they still made those as they fit in your hands easier (not as thick) but are still 2 disks high instead of a fat single disk high 48 disk wallet like they make now. All in all, a great product for the price."
2834,We bought these to check out the wildlife in the back yard pond.  These auto focus binoculars are super cool.  You aren't constantly fumbling with the dial to try to get what you want to see in your view.  They seem well made and have provided an excellent crystal clear picture.  My only problem is I tend to hold them too close to my eyeballs.. and they sometimes get a slight fog.. not their fault.. just my user error:)
2835,"Fine product, tight fit for your palm but makes it a bit oversized (it kills the idea behind tiny pda). It's a great product for storage/transport not quick access. I think that I will try the all around aluminium case for actuall work. Closure is kind of flimsy and case opens up but since your palm is tightly jammed it wont fall out. Nethherless it's still a problem."
2836,"They sound really good and they look techy too. The sound is a bit ""tinnier"" than I would have liked, but the bass from the subwoofer is great. It comes with a Y-adapter for use with left/right audio cables (like on a Playstation or something). There's a power button, a volume wheel, a bass wheel, and a headphone jack on the right speaker. The bass is automatically reduced along with the volume. The subwoofer plugs into the outlet, the right speaker plugs into the subwoofer and audio jack, and has a permanent (but long) cord connecting to the left speaker. The blue light (on the new model) is a bit gimmicky but looks neat nonetheless. The speakers are magnetically shielded and the subwoofer is not, but it's supposed to go on the floor anyway. The AC adapter is much smaller than usual (and more convenient). For the price, they're a steal."
2837,"The 1.8D IS a very good lens, but just sold it. I was about to buy the NEW sharper and more contrasty 1.8G for my D7000, I was very exited about ordering it because the 1.8G is a better lens than the 1.8. But something happened, I saw other reviews saying amazing things about the Rokinon 1.4. I have been wanting to get the 1.4D or the Sigma 1.4 but the prices are just ridiculous, i could not affort a $800 or more, and USED, even worse. The only reason i did not buy the new 1.8G is because people complain about the cheap feel of it, and is said that IT IS LIGHTER, and cheaper made than the older solid 1.8D. Even people that know what they are talking about say that, like Ken Rockwell and Jared at Froknowsphoto.com.My D7000 is already a very very light camera, which i dont like so much. With the 1.8D it felt just okay on my hands, but i know that if i would have put the new 1.8G on it, it would have felt TOO LIGHT. Ken Rockwell mentioned in his review of this lens that TWO lenses died on him. This NEW LENSES have built-in motors in them, and the stuff is made in CHINA?? PERSONALLY, i just have a bad feeling about spending MY money for sometning that is this badly made, with moving parts in them. It makes a lot of sense that this new lenses will not last as the older ones do.BUT, if i had not seen the Rokinon, i would have gotten this nikon G lens, no doubht about it. This Rokinon is incredibly just as good as the Nikon 1.4D and the CHEAPER BUILT Sigma. It puts this lenses to SHAME for the price difference.My 1.8 was made in JAPAN. In fact i think all or most the HIGH END Nikon lenses are made in Japan. These are the two reasons why I skipped the new G lens. IT IS A VERY GOOD LENS, I do not doubht that, THIS IS THE LENS I WAS GOING TO GET, until i found out about the Rokinon 1.4.I am BLOWN AWAY by the Rokinon. I did see lots of reviews that this lens is very very difficult to use, but because i have been wanting to get a 1.4 for a long time, i decided to take a chance and try it. This is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life! The lens IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT to use. I just bought it a couple of days ago, and yes, i have missed some shots(mostly in low light) but I also have gotten some awesome and beautiful photos. This lens is NOT mainly made for video either. Not true. ANY manual focus will teach you to be PATIENT, to take more artistic photos and to pay attention. The BOKEH is INCREDIBLE!! and already SHARP at 1.4 also. This lens is not plasticky and light, but is not too heavy either, feels great on my D7000. The focus ring IS NOT STIFF. Samyang/Rokinon designed this thing beautifully. With that slow ring speed is how i am able to get good shots and the D7000 able to get the focus point right on."
2838,"This lens draws raves from its fans, and while it isn't that good, it is still a good bang for the buck.  50mm for DX size sensors is an odd focal length.  It isn't really a wide angle, but it is too short to be a tele.  It is a little long for me as a ""normal"" lens.  I use it mostly for low/available light shots indoors, but I find that I wish the field of view were a little larger.This is a lens that most Nikon DSLR owners have in their bag, and for good reason.  It is well made, reasonably priced, and relatively small.  Just don't make it your only lens."
2839,"This lens requires that your Nikon camera have an internal motor in order to use the AF feature. My fault, ordered the correct lens50mm f/1.8G AF-S  great lens."
2840,These work great for my Dragon dictate! They work better than the $80 headset I tried first. They are definitely not for music enjoyment but for speech recognition use they are top drawer.
2841,"These have nice bass compared to the more expensive earbuds I often wear. They are very thin and light, but therefore they don't have a lot of spring strength to keep them on my head, so I usually wear a cap to keep them in place. Also, the cord is a bit too short to put my mp3 player in my pants pocket, so I usually put it in a shirt pocket. They have lasted a long time (sorry can't be more specific, but a few years is a good estimate) w/out the cord breaking inside or at the plug, like most all of them do after a while.Hope this review helps."
2842,"This cable performs well with my Sony camcorder at a price that can't be beat by the big box stores. If you intend to use this with a MacBook Pro, keep in mind you will need an adapter (which won't cost much.)"
2843,"these cans are mandatory for audio restoration work, they allow me to hear all the way into the recording, and have enough clarity for me to clearly distinguish between music and noise. but, and this is a big but- i've had 4 sennheiser cans and all four have broken on me! 4 for 4 is NOT good! one channel or the other drops out after a few years of use. also with some waveforms, there are resonances which color the sound- for example, some harp recordings cause spurious tones [akin to ""wolf tones""] to develop in these cans, they could use better damping in their frames. but i have not heard any other cans that i consider transparent enough for audio restoration tasks."
2844,The item was exactly as described and arrived promptly.  No problems were encountered and the item was installed and worked as it should have.
2845,I've always been pleased with the products that RCA has produced and this doesn't disappoint. A good quality wire at a good price.
2846,"That's all you need with something like this, does it work, yep it does.  Simple and not too expensive.  Good."
2847,"Good snug fit for a 10.1"" netbook. Provides adequate protection, could use a bit more in the way of pocket space for power chord, external drive,etc. which is why I deducted one star. For the little $$$ it cost, really can't complain much. The trade-off would be a bulkier size, so YMMV."
2848,"Once assembled and placed where you want them, they look great, and are sturdy. They arent distracting and have a small profile. I have a bose 321 GS series III. To tip these things over youd have to push them passed 70 degrees. These wont be falling over, however read what I have to say later about durability.Wire management is good. Wires are hidden and the stands are at a perfect height for the average person sitting on a the average couch.The only complaints I have is that they are annoying to assemble. Not difficult, just annoying. For example the rod doesnt line up on its own, you have to eye it as youre screwing it to the base to get it facing straight forward. You will need a philips head screwdriver to assemble it. Also, the connection between the rod and the base is plenty sturdy, but its not without worry. If someone fell onto the rod it doesnt seem like it could take much before snapping off or bending.The caps that cover the mounting screws behing the speakers are kind of cheap and can be broken easily when installing, so be careful with that.Assembly is only a one time thing though, and it looks great when its all together. Im satisfied with the purchase."
2849,"this is a good turntable for the price. the cartridge has reasonable sound a lot  of people would be happy with. i put an audio technica at311ep in to have an bi-radial stylus (to track deeper down in the groove). NOTE; i have an old test lp with a blank section to test anti-skating. with the stock cartridge the arm stays in one place. the audio technica skates towards the label! i reduced the tracking weight by removing the set screw that and fixed it. i thought all p-mounts were the same weight.........oh yeah, when i cue up an lp my big fat hand trips the stop/return bar. a little dab of hot glue fixed that (easily removable). you still have the cueing switch to lift the arm somewhere in the middle and manually move the arm without worry.i'd recommend this for someone who wants to listen their old vinyl. BUY A WET BRUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A DIRTY RECORD IS GOING TO SOUND DIRTY."
2850,This camera is about as simple as they get.  I gave this camera to my daughter who is 9 and she loves it.  She has it hooked up to her E-machines Celeron Win Xp system and uses it as a web cam for yahoo IM.  As a webcam it gives good images and works well (better than quickcam express USB).  As a digital camera it can take 40 352 x 144 pixel photos or 160 176 x 144 pixel photos.  It can also take 15 seconds of video.  It runs on 4 AAA batteries as a digital camera or off the USB power as a webcam.  The digital camera even has a timer and a multisnap mode that will snap off 5 shots at one second intervals.  It provides a counter for the photos and battery status indicator.  I would suggest going to Logitech's web site and downloading the most up to date software and installing it rather than starting with the supplied CD.  Mine had ver 5.6.3 supplied but version 7 is out now.  With the supplied software you can even set up the webcam to be a motion sensor camera and take shots when it senses movement.  Overall it is a good cheap webcam with the option to remove it from its cradle and take some low quality snapshots.  If purchased on sale with rebate it should be a good deal.
2851,"It's surprising how many music fans stick with the cheap speakers delivered with their  computers. Considering how much time is spent in front of the computer (rather than  perfectly centered between one's hi-fi system's speakers), this low-to-medium grade audio  has become the primary interpreter of many listener's music experience. And that's a shame, because there are dozens of reasonably priced computer add-on audio systems available whose reproductive abilities far surpass the $19 speakers bundled with most computers.Klipsch is a well-known name in home audio, and their products incite both love and hate  among audio enthusiasts.  No doubt their desktop speakers, such as this system, will produce similar (though perhaps less extreme) reactions.  The lesson to be learned is this: auditioning speakers for yourself, in person, is critical.  This can be difficult with  consumer electronics of this price category, as you're unlikely to find them set up in a  quiet room, or available for take-home auditions.  If you plan to audition them in a large (super-)store, arrive at opening to get as quiet an environment as possible.This three-way system (subwoofer and two desktop satellites) compares very favorably to others in its class.  It is a huge improvement over the speakers that ship with most desktop computers, and, depending on taste, a step-up from many of the premium systems one might add to a computer purchase.  The desktop two-way satellites throw an impressive stereo image, and the high- and mid-range have enough sizzle and punch to be present, but not so much as to be fatiguing.  The subwoofer blends well with the midrange.  The desktop speakers are also visually attractive (though not nearly as high-design as some of the competitors), which helps, given that they're within eyesight at all times. One satellite also has a handy auxilliary input jack, perfect for connecting an MP3 player or other temporary input source.Set up is simple, though there are a couple of minor issues to be noted. The cabling seems to be a bit more complicated than necessary. A separate speaker wire runs from each satellite to the subwoofer, and then separate cables connect the computer's audio out to the left satellite, and then the left satellite to the subwoofer.  Combining some of these (and perhaps daisy-chaining the satellites) would make for neater setup.The power switch is inconveniently located on the back of the subwoofer. Make sure to pick up a power strip with an on/off switch (or be prepared to climb under your desk).  Also, for cost/price-point reasons, Klipsch failed to add circuitry to mute the audio output when the amplifier switches on. The result is an annoyingly loud pop when the system is powered on. Setting the volume level to zero has no effect.Finally, the audio controls are limited to volume and subwoofer, leaving users to adjust balance via the computer's setting (as well as any other equalization one might like to do). Not really much of a problem, but less flexible than some other systems.Ergonomic nit-picks aside, this is a fine system, with better sound than any of the others in its class. It's well worth the price that Klipsch asks for it (which tends to be a few dollars higher than equivalent models from other manufacturers), and a terrific purchase for anyone whose computer has become a major source of musical sound.4-1/2 stars, if Company A allowed fractional ratings."
2852,I guess my Sony camera is getting out of date since these cassettes are not available in many stores. But this filled the bill very well.
2853,"I owned over several CD portables and the IRiver 350 is coolest. The remote control is ""To Die For"". The remote is like a little computer; it can open PC folders of MP3. I don't know of any MP3 player will do this. Now, I want to buy the IRiver 400 as a second player. I wish IRiver will made a Super Audio CD portable in the future. I will defintely buy it.happy listening,steve:-)"
2854,"I've owned this DVD player for 3+ years (I'm going by memory) and yesterday I got the H07 error of death.  I can see that I'm not alone.However, I've gotten a lot of use out of this player in 3 years, I don't recall paying more than $50 for it and haven't found a comparable player for mp3 menus.  So, if you consider this can be had for $10 +/- per year, I'd say this was a pretty good deal, less than what I pay for 3 beers at happy hour.  Reading other reviews, it would seem that the H07 error has turned worlds upside down, but at $39, I think we should stop complaining.  No, I'm not affiliated with Panasonic and I really did get the H07 error last night.  But I would pay $39 for 3 years of this player before I'd pay $80 for another that would last 6 years, because when this player worked, it worked well."
2855,"I bought this expecting it to be my ""starter"" digital camera.as often happens with electronics I buy something and then, through my experience, refine my concept of what I need. Normally I end up purchasing something closer to meeting my needs in a second (or third!) purchase.  Or I buy something not quite as expensive as the ""top of the line"", only later to break down and pay for the improvements/enhancements garnered by laying out the long green.I may have proven those theories wrong with this purchase.  frankly, I can find no major faults with this camera.I have taking photos since boyhood and have owned quite high-end 35mm cameras from Nikon and Canon.  I am demanding in image quality.  This camera has fulfilled all my expectations and more from a digital camera.  BTW 2 megapixels is more than enough if you use the highest quality setting on the camera and do not plan to enlarge your photos to larger than 8X10""...but who does?  the color rendering is also spot on.  the metering takes a bit of study (of the manual) and practice to get the right results under tough lighting condition but once you do master that you can get really great results.the only limitation I find with this camera is the zoom.  too little optical zoom range for my tastes and the digital zoom results in reduced image quality. BUT HEY this is for trips, etc. not for professional results, I guess I was spoiled by all my telephoto lenses on my 35mm cameras, I have gladly left all of that bulky equipment in the closet now.Rugged construction and nice to look at.  great photos and low-ish pricing.  what's not to love.  I think you will not be disappointed by this camera."
2856,"Worked nice while it worked, but after a couple of months the alarm part quit working. Changed the batteries with fresh ones, but it still doesn't work.ETA: changed my rating. It started working again. And also, I took the batteries out and plugged it into a power adapter. Works just fine, except when it's really windy. Then there's more false alarms. Definitely worth the money."
2857,"This is a great product. My sister has a habit of walking in unannounced especially when I am in the back part of my house working with my computer. This device announces her arrival every time! The only complaint I would have is that it is pretty loud even on the ""low"" setting and that it rings three times when it is triggered...a thin piece of foam over the front of the receiver fixed this problem nicely. This is a great product for the price."
2858,"My husband & I both bought a pair of these for our honeymoon - they got tested out 12 hours to and from Hawaii.  They are very comfortable for long-term use.While they are not noise cancelling, they are closed - which means they block out some noise and the person sitting next to you doesn't hear everything you hear.  We decided to go with these headphones rather than $100-200 pair.  I did extensive research because I wanted a good sound and long term comfort.My iPod and Archos video players sound great with these headphones.  You hear a lot more of the music and details than you do with $10-20 cheapies.  A lot of reviews talk about an over-emphasis with the bass.  I didn't really notice it on music that wasn't supposed to have bass - so I can't complain.  Hard rock, classical, comedy albums, r&b; - everything sounded nice to me on these babies.The only weird thing is that the cord is very long, and it would be nice if the cord went into just one side of the headphones rather than a dual cord at the top.  Bring a twist tie with you for the section of the cord you aren't using - you could almost jump rope with it!  They are also not incredibly small (not huge like stereo headphones) but not incredibly portable (for a small purse) either.If you want a cheaper version of the same pair, check out the HD202's which go for about half the price.  We were glad we went with these headphones - Sennheiser makes a good product."
2859,"I purchased this for my Microwave.  This model was cheaper than the one without the phone surge protection.  I have heavier-duty surge protectors on my washer, dryer, fridge, etc., but was happy to find one with a good joule rating at an affordable price that would work with smaller appliances."
2860,You can get replacement earpads at Sony website... for 2.95 each. Cost me 8.95 including shipping for a set. Can't seem to get on Company A.com or I would have. PN is 499432401. https://servicesales.sel.sony.com
2861,"Altho some have used this product to improve their cable system I put this amplifier on my digital conversion box to try and clean up some channels I was getting from my old antenna. After hooking it up, I got an additional 6-8 channels and clarity of the picture increased. I now have 20 channels on my old tube TV in the garage and the picture has improved. Worth the investment."
2862,"I enjoy listening to wNYC radio in the morning (93.9FM) and need this for my commute to work.  I wanted something that was digital tuned, long battery life, and also got great reception.  This device meets all of those needs and then some.  See below:PROS:1. Great reception - this beats even the best rated Sony pocket radios.2. Digital tuner - while not as fast as tuning in manually, at least you know you are locked into the signal with the best reception.3. Memory for retaining stations4. Great sounding speaker5. Lock mechanism (similar to iPods that have the lock to keep items from changing when carrying the device.CONS:1. Switch that changes the headphones to speaker and vice-versa needs to be a bit harder to switch (to prevent accidental switching if the item happens to be in your pocket).2. Pricey - $45 for a pocket radio.  If my wife only knew! :-/IN SUMMARY:I would not consider any other brand radio at this moment.  I get all I need with this one great pocket radio."
2863,"I'll be among those who agree that these don't offer the best sound quality. However, I use them for working out and don't want to block out all outside noises (other people, traffic). The can be easily removed and hung around the neck and replaced just the same. I hate messing with other types where you have to twist something and then stick it on your ears everytime you want to put them on or back on. The folding feature is nice and I use it all the time."
2864,"I needed an ethernet cable to connect my modem to my wireless router in another room.  Buying a 50' cat5e cable (capable of gigabit internet speeds) made me a bit nervous, as I didn't want any signal degradation over that long of a distance. Luckily enough, there is absolutely no signal degradation. I drilled a hole through the wall in the other room, fed the cable through it, and hooked it up - works great!  The only downside is that the cable isn't very sturdy, and got tangled very easily (large knots). I accidentally put a staple directly through the cable trying to secure it to the floor, and it still works just fine. Good enough for me!"
2865,Loved these cases.  I can color coordinate my CD's and such with all the different kinds of colors they were available in this package.
2866,"It works and its cheap.  The picture shows a black cable but, I was sent a beige cable. I subtracted one star because of the incorrect picture."
2867,"not bad for the price. most cables are the same quality unless you go for real high end stuff that's used in live sound and professional studios. Trust me, you don't need high end cables with your consumer level equipment. Unless your setup costed thousands of dollars, cables like this will do just fine."
2868,"I am very glad that I bought this memory stick because the 8mb memory stick that came with my camera was a big laugh.  Fortunately I had a 32mb memory stick from the camera I was upgrading from...but still that could only hold 20 shots at maximum resolution.  Now with the 128mb memory stick, I can get a bit over 80 shots at max resolution (3.3 megapixel).HOWEVER; be advised that if you are upgrading from a 32 to 128 which is 4 times the storage amount, it will take longer to format, and you will notice more delay insofar as image writing and image previewing (ie. after taking a shot and going to the preview mode to see the last picture you took, it was almost instantaneous with the 32mb memory stick, but now with the 128mb stick, you click on the preview mode and nothing happens until after about 1-2 seconds, then you get the preview...).  If you are upgrading from a 64mb stick, the delay probably won't be as noticeable.  This is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars, I was hoping for the same quick performance as my 32mb stick...so it was a little bit of a let-down.  Will I return it?  No way, this is still the best buy for a memory stick!"
2869,"My first review of this was a 1, because I was unable to install the software to operate the mouse. After all but giving up, I finally got the software installed and it works great! It has a very smooth and quick operation, and I believe that for the price it is a good value. I have tried others that were more expensive, but they do not operate any better than this one. I stand corrected!"
2870,"It works with no issues on 5 different PCMCIA/Cardbus slots I've tried in combination with at least 8 different CF cards from various manufacturers. I also have the non-Ultra blue/red version of this adaptor, and I couldn't tell any difference between the two other than the label and part number (hence on 4 stars due to the higher cost of this Ultra version)."
2871,"Worked just fine for me the sound was good, channels easy to find and I could use it on a home portable stereo; but I live on a small island."
2872,"My grand plan was to use this unit behind my wall mounted TV. With a newly added power outlet up and to the left of the TV mount, I wanted to protect the television and cable box from surges. In hindsight, I should have spent a little more on an outlet with a built in surge protector. Anyway, I ended up using the Belkin elsewhere in the house. Had it been a little more vertically centered it would have cleared the mount arms.Subtracted a star because even with the screw tight, it still wiggled a little bit."
2873,"I plugged the keyboard and mouse into my P-4 running ME and booted up. It worked immediately, without the software. I did need to install the driver to get the multimedia keys to work. They are nice. I use MM Jukebox to play MP3s. I expected Microsoft to have the system default to their own media player, but when I hit the music key, Jukebox popped up with my last play list. The volume and play keys worked without a hitch. The mute key is a great feature when you receive phone calls. I have a 2.4hz wireless phone and a wireless network. Neither were disrupted by this system, or had an effect on the performance of the mouse/keyboard. If they do, you can select a different channel. Other fast keys include MyDocuments and MyPictures. A nice feature on the keyboard is printing on the front side of keys used in combination with the Ctrl key. For instance, the &quot;B&quot; key says BOLD, the &quot;C&quot; key says COPY and so on. The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because of the mouse. I was using a wired Intellimouse Explorer and liked the programmable thumb keys that I used for Forward/Back. They are missing on the wireless mouse. My original Intellimouse Explorer came with a limited lifetime warranty. One of the thumb switches stopped working after three years of heavy use. Microsoft replaced it promptly at no charge. I was impressed. Unfortunately, the wireless keyboard/mouse combo comes with only a 30 day warranty. I'll keep my fingers crossed."
2874,"I would have given this little gem of radio a 5 instead of a 4+ but it has some weak points.  Mainly Strong AM stations splatter over 20 MC on the dail making it hard to tune weaker stations close by, but rotating the radio may clear this up. Also a light for the display would have been nice. Other than that everthing works as advertized.Indeed the AM sounds excellent on local stations and is very listenable for long periods of time on talk as well as music programs. I noticed with a thunderstorm close by that the static is filtered very nicely on this radio.  The radio picked up a weak station from 100 miles well and a strong Chicago station  from 300 miles very well. The AM sounds as if you are listening to a much larger radio.I would say for the average person this radio has many fine features and very good quality for the price."
2875,I bought several of these to leave in different locations where I might need temporary cable extensions. I have only used them with 100Mbps ethernet and they seem to work fine. They are a bit of a tight fit with the connectors that I am using but very usable. Since they seem to get legs on occasion I also carry a few spares in my laptop bag. Certainly worth the money.
2876,"Capacity is too small, but that was a bad decision on my part.  Have grown to prefer SanDisk over Lexar."
2877,"I'm updating my review based on further experimentation with the the unit.  I tried out this unit with MP3 files created using Real Jukebox Plus.  The sound from the 35S was really annoying based based on the Real Jukebox files.  When I recreated the files using the Real 1 software supplied with the 35S, the sound quality out of the 35S improved dramatically!  All in all, the software package is is easy to install and use.  I use the player now have to admit it's a great unit for workouts.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to replace the headphones."
2878,"I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static ""Warhammer models"" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were ""too long"" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot.The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting.As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in ""startled"" subjects and missed shots.The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well."
2879,"I am not a pro. I am a little dissapointed with this expensive lens. I did some non-profesional comparison and don't see much difference comparing to my 28-135mm IS at 70mm and 135mm.If I had a choice, I will buy those less expensive 70-300 IS lens.Now the most used lens in my collection is the $75 prime 50mm f1.8. I just love this plastic cheap feeling lens.I got some dirt on this 70-200mm IS lens, how do you pro guys clean it?Thanks a bunch,Nick Xu"
2880,I never knew a lens cap could cap a lens so well.  But seriously this is a great lens cap.  However I also have an aftermarket one that has a nice string on it that I attached to my camera and thus no need to keep buying lens caps.  I suppose if Nikon did something simple like this they wouldn't sell as many $10 replacement lens caps.
2881,This seems like a factory lens caps.  I dropped it to 4 stars because the buttons have a slight wobble.  Still it fits perfectly.  What can you say about a lens cap????
2882,"For a small speaker, at well under two hundred dollars (I'd say closer to one hundred dollars would be a fair price) these Polks outperforms larger speakers in the same price range.  I would look on eBay for the best deals.Weirdly enough, the R20s which you'd think would be better given its higher model number, actually sound much worse than these---the R15 has a better tweeter which means better mids and highs.Of course you wouldn't ever want to use these are your two front mains unless you were using it mainly for home theatre and/or low and moderate volume listening, and also had a powered subwoofer to deliver the bass.  They would probably do just fine as surround speakers, though.Now if you were looking for really good quality small speakers I'd recommend Ascend Acoustics CBM-170s or Paradigm Mini-Monitors, the Ascends are availabe only online direct and cost up to three times as much but if you read their reviews on audioreviews dot com you'll see why."
2883,"One of the most attractive radios in its price range, well constructed, lacking cheap materials, and having a crisp, full monoaural speaker, the Tivoli Model One is an analog radio, which means you have to use the dial to find the sweet spot every time you tune to your favorite station. This can be a chore for some. Additionally, the reception is about a grade B+ for FM and B for AM. Remember, the Model One doesn't come with a telescopic antenna like the slightly more expensive Tivoli PAL. You only get a little pig tail in the back, which can prove inadequate for hard-to-reach stations. Yet understandably it's easy to fall in love with this radio, so what do you do? I'd recommend buying it. But instead of buying an external antenna to strengthen your reception, spend a hundred dollars (or 65 on the Chinese Degen 1103 model) on the Kaito 1103 digital radio. Easilly fitting on top of the Tivoli, the 1103 has the double the FM strength of the Tivoli a and has over a hundred digital presets. The problem with the Kaito 1103 is its little speaker. But the Kaito is small enough to fit ontop of the Tivoli Model One and be hooked up with an audio cable through the Tivoli's provided ""Auxilliary In"" connection. So now you have erased the weaknesses of both radios and maximized their strengths in what will be the best ""radio"" you can buy. The cost for this radio hybrid, about two hundred dollars, is still less than half of a Bose radio, which, in spite of its nice speakers, suffers from mediocre FM/AM reception.The Tivoli Model is such an attractive, well-made radio that it's worth combining it with the super-performing Kaito 1103. By itself, however, I'm afraid it's more looks than performance."
2884,"I originally rated this item 1 star, simply because I was unable to download the software to operate this product. After many attempts, I finally got the software to install. What a great mouse! It works great, much better than I had anticipated. I liked it so much, I purchased another for my other computer. This is a good buy for the money."
2885,Needed a cheap pair of earphones for work in a warehouse where conveyor belts and fans are super loud. Fit nicely in ears. Nice length. Decent sound quality. And they're a reputable brand. I'm satisfied!
2886,"I use these interconnects in place of generic one with my Squeezebox touch connecting to my NAD C326 with Polk Audio TSi 300 speakers.Please keep in mind that I am not an audiophile but I found very negligible difference in sound quality comparing these cables to stock Logitech interconnects.Regarding build quality, these cables are very thick with good solid thick connectors. They look very premium and so I am not disappointed with spending money on these interconnects as expensive hifi system demands good loooking interconnects as well."
2887,"Very useful cleaner.  I use it often.  I thought it was a gimmick at first, but, it does what it's supposed to without damage to the glass."
2888,"I bought this Cobra telescopic antenna for my Cobra Roadtrip handheld CB.  It performs better than the included mini-whip, but it is not as sturdy as I'd like it to be.  It has two parts, the lower part with a coil, and the upper screw-on telescopic antenna.  The lower part with the coil is covered with a plastic layer and it seems like the coil under it it hasn't been soldered carefully, so there is a sharp bump under the plastic which might get exposed after longer usage and standar tear and wear.  Fully extended, it measures about 27 inches, compared to the 11.5"" in its folded state.  It attaches to the handheld using its BNC connector which works perfectly for the Cobra handheld, but if you are buying this for some other CB radio with standard antenna connector you will need to buy the adapter. Bottom line - it works, but it could have been designed smoother."
2889,I have four of these. They are great for the money but aren't as tough as the more expensive cases. The thin metal edge dents easily and the sides are made of wood panels which soak up water if allowed to get wet. Definitely not tough enough for air travel but it makes a reasonably priced case for normal wear and tear. The foam is the pick and pluck variety and is easy to make exact openings to fit a variety of gear.
2890,"Life without music would be to me like a bird denied wings.One of my chief musical joys is walking down the street listening to my mp3 player and watching the movie of life go by with my own custom soundtrack. These headphones are the most detailed, musical, and comfortable I have ever found, short of a real good pair of studio Sennheisers, at more than twice the price and size. I can hear Jaco's fingers on the bass strings...I can hear Bird take breaths in between phrases...I can smile happily anywhere because the tri-ports also block out all sound other than my music!The greatest tribute I can give to these is that I have started taking them with me in my trips to the high wilderness...I used to just take my Koss porta-pros, which are phenomenal for their size and weight, but don't have the punch, bass, and detail of the tri-ports. I hate carrying extra weight or bulk for a week at 12 to 14 thousand feet...but once you've heard Bohm's version of Beethoven's Sixth on these while watching a spectacular crimson sunset from the peak of a mountain, you can't not bring them!As for them not lasting, as other reviewers claim, well, mine did kind of fall apart at the headband area after a while, but I attribute that to wearing them non-stop in a hot spring for 14 hours at 9,000 feet, where they kept me blissfully apart from occasional visitors who came and went and looked at me strangely as I smiled and gazed out over the valley, imagining how Bach must have felt hearing the music in his head while traipsing through the Alps...and only the headband melted a little, which was easily super-glued together. I don't think Bose had that use in mind, to be fair. The phones themselves are as good as ever after many an adventure, some of them nautical...to me, that's pretty solid quality.These are incredibly musical, and turn any little walkman-type thang into a good stereo unit. On a proper sound system, with a crisp slab of vinyl on a fine turntable, they will blow your mind.Edit: the other reviewers here were right about the cheesy plastic head band connection. Mine broke just like theirs after a year or so. I duct-taped them and that worked fine for a long time. Sennheiser may make a better phone for the money; I haven't heard their new cheaper models. But these do have amazing bass, are super comfy, and block sound as well as Koss' more expensive sound blocking models, so I'd still say they're worth buying (for about 70, if you can find them for that; Grado 60s and the cheaper Senns do indeed sound better but don't seal out sound like these ); still, wrap a little tape around the headband first.Sigh. Come on, Bose! You can do better than that crappy plastic part. These cans deserve it."
2891,"A bit pricey, but that's Bose. The system is easy to set up, with wiring clearly labeled. All wiring and connections are included and  connectors are prepared and ready for installation. There is a lot of wire. Bose gives you very long lengths of cable, which for most typical installations is way too much. This is a small system, not designed for a large room. Stowing the extra lengths of wire can be a problem."
2892,"I am by no means an audiophile (not even sure I just spelled that correctly), but I do enjoy these headphones.  I watch shows and movies mostly on my ipad and found these to be comfortable and the sound very good.  Blocks out ambient noise very well."
2893,"The is only one thing to say about this lense: Awesome! This little jewel is affordable and sharp as a tack. The depth of field you get is astounding. It is so fast it stops snow flakes in flight giving an outdoor snap-shot a real pro-like look.  The build quality is about what you would expect for $98.00 but that is it's only flaw... every thing else you might have read in other reviews, about the bokeh being not as smooth and the edges being harsh at wide open are true! But lets keep this in perspective... I took a picture of my three year old niece blowing out a candle with the Christmas tree lights in the background. I caught a moment in time! By candle light! Wow. Print the picture and hand it to Nana or Mimi and see if either of those loving matriarchs will pick up on the rectangular bokeh! (Ain't happening) No... all they will see is a really great portrait of a really cute kid, that I took. Someday I will probably have the f1.4 50mm. I will also have a few other higher value lenses but I bought this lense to have some fun with right now and on that note it gets my strong recommendation. The build quality is cheap though and for that alone I took a star. Is it still a great value? Absolutely! So, in perspective, for less than a hundred bucks you would be foolish not to have this in your bag of tricks."
2894,"Love this little lens. I use it for studio work and although at times it might feel a bit too ""zoomed in"" its a great lens for the amount of money you spend. Definitely one of my best purchases as far as lenses goes (that coming from someone who doesn't have an L yet of course).I doubt I'll ever get rid of this little lens, like I said great bang for the buck."
2895,$100 for 50mm 1.8 is hard to beat.The auto-focus is loud and not very smooth. That being said if you want to smooth that out shell out an extra few hundred dollars and grab the 1.4. Gives great bokeh and allows you to shoot in some situations where the standard kit lenses just can't get the shot.
2896,"I am currently using this tripod to take pictures of various landscapes around Nevada and it seems to work well and does feel as cheap as I was expecting, it does have a lot of parts made out of plastic but if you treat it well it should last a long time."
2897,"no issues, this is the second pair, lost the first one after a few years of usage, then I bought this again and within 6 months I have lost these already.  I will be replacing these again with the same ones.  the wires do get tangled a bit with the ear loops but it doesn't bother me that much."
2898,"I bought one of these on eBay.  It took me a while to figure out that you have to remove the rubber feet on the router.  (I've got a WRT54GL.)  I used a pair of pliers, which ended up tearing one of the feet a bit.  After that, wall mounting was straightforward.  The router is held in place by friction, but the friction is pretty decent."
2899,Works perfectly on Win7 x64 systems. Highly recommend if you need a serial port on your modern Win7 / Win8 x64 laptop.
2900,"I always take an extra Cap in my bag for my lenses. Just in case you lose the one on the lens, it's not really worth damaging your lens, or probably even your filter. Some caps that come with filter sets are 'usable' on the canon lenses / protective filters, but often they just fit better when used with the filter they came with, so i tend to shy away from this approach experimentally. I would like to see a 3 or 4 way cap with that many tabs, so when you brush it, it doesn't just come off, but of course this might make it harder to take off than is desirable.Summary:+ Fits properly.- Cost (should be at most $4 MSRP).- No 'cap keeper' included."
2901,It works fine as my previous routers that typically went down in about 2 to 3 years. I'll see how long this one can last.
2902,"Linksys always makes great products. The one I received from my seller was great except for 1 thing, the cat5 cable wouldn't stay plugged in to the back of it. It was damaged, instead of returning it I just used some tape to make sure the cable stays in. It works fine other than that. Has a decent range and gets the WiFi extended to where I need it."
2903,This hood was not made for my lens but it works ok with my 35-70 Nikor. Keeps the flare out...
2904,Works great with my home phone. good audio quality and fits well on my head. Very happy with this item.
2905,My wife spends a lot of time on the phone.I think her neck was about to fall off.So I decided to buy her this set and the price seemed so good that I purchased 2 for the house.No complaints at all. Works pretty good.Note: You can't control the volume except from your phone and you can't hear yourself thru the head phones but every body on the other side says we sound clear to them.No more neck aches.For the price can't do better.
2906,"I have used the produce for 9 months. It is a brilliant design -- saved me many many hours in searching for locations in new areas, e.g. friends home, hotels, restaurants, theaters, museums, even highway rest areas; you cam imagine.But that was not exactly like that in the beginning. My IQue asked for numerous soft and hard resets, and sometimes was making noise that could only be stopped by a soft reset. Those happened in navigation. Once when I was on highway I had to drive into a rest area to soft-reset it because of the noise.Then, about 5 months ago when my wife and I moved to Chicago the GPS stopped to work right after we arrived. The PDA part was working but the GPS part could not receive satellite signals. What a timing! we did not know that area at all. I re-installed the software several times, but it was not working. Finally I sent it back to Garmin and was told the GPS receiver was bad. The GARMIN service was good, with prompt e-mail response and prompt replacement.The replacement unit is working much more stably, after I installed the newest OS patch (r3). It still requires occasional soft or hard reset, but very infrequently. Garmin also put updates to the map software on their web site (not sure if the map was updated or not), and a patch that stores voice guidance files into SD card. The latter one is very useful; now the voice guidance would not be lost after a hard reset (imagine one in a long trip without carrying a computer).Not considering the instability (occasional after r3 patch), this unit is wonderful. The PDA part is powerful, with fast processor and large memory (32MB internal). The display is good, large and colorful. I used to have a Plam Vx and this one is totally different. (No so good are the short battery life and the lack of wireless connection.)Finally, the combination of PDA and GPS is a shining idea! The GPS enjoys the SD memory extension. I bought a 256 MB card that is more than any Garmin consumer GPS (I only used 80MB for the areas I frequently visit). And the PDA becomes a mobile map device with directory information. I frequently found myself use this Palm to search for some local business.In some sense the unit is better than a in-car GPS. Before a trip I can sit in my home creating waypoints for points of interests that I will visit. I am not willing to sit in a car doing that (Of course, an in-car GPS would have a larger screen for the ease of nagivation).Wonderful unit after having all the patches!"
2907,"I tried everything. My last attempt at a decent headphone for use in a noisy gym was the Shure E3C ""in-ear"" headphones. You can see my review for those in the Sure E3C section. Before trying those out I had been using the Sony MDR-NC20's for the last 6 months. They did cancel the noise out pretty well but the sound was terribly muffled (no highs) the mids seemed squashed to me almost like they were compressed and while the lows were there, they were very mushy. For a while I just figured that this was the price one pays for using noise canceling technology. Then I went on a hunt again and read some good reviews for the Sennheiser PXC250's so I went and purchased a pair. I first just put the batteries in and tried them at home. They sounded great! Rich low-end, brilliant but not harsh highs. Overall a very pleasant EQ curve. But the real test would be at the gym.The ambient noise in this gym is the constant roar of treadmills, stair machines, stationary bikes, etc. Overall these cover a fairly broad frequency spectrum. I put the headphones on and started the music. Oooops! I forgot to turn the noise canceling on. After doing so I couldn't believe my ears. With the music on (and not even too loud) I felt isolated in the room. The sound was absolutely top-notch and turning on the noise cancellation circuitry actually improved the sound quality! While I have tried the Bose noise canceling headphones it was around 6 months ago so I don't feel qualified to do a direct comparison. However, I do not remember them blowing me away like these Sennheisers did.I think it's also important to know what kind of music I used to judge these phones as someone into classical music might looking for a different sound than someone into rock. I have been either a professional musician or otherwise involved in the music industry for the last 40 years. My music types of choice and the genres I used to judge these phones were progressive rock, rock, and fusion jazz. My reference headphones are the Sony MDR-7506's which, to me, are some of the best sounding headphones one can purchase without completely breaking the bank. They are also some of the most used headphones in the studios I worked in and visited. These Sony phones can produce a very low yet articulate bass and smooth mids and highs that are never over bearing. While the PXC250's are not as rich sounding as the Sony MDR-7506's, to me they are just as pleasant sounding. There are no frequencies I miss when listening to these."
2908,"I've had this set of headphones for a while, and they are as good as everyone says.This review is more of a tip for those who own the headset but have managed to lose one or both of the foam ear pads.  They are kinda loose and one of them fell off during a walk.Looking for a replacement earpads were a bummer (everywhere online wanted an arm and a leg for shipping).  I ended getting a pair of super cheap koss kph6 / ur5 (it comes with an extra set of foam ear pads) and the pads fit my px100 perfectly!  It was actually cheaper to buy the koss (which comes with two sets of foam pads) than to buy a single pair of replacement foam pads (generic or sennheiser)."
2909,"It plays everything I've put in it - DVD, DVD+R, CD-R, CD-RW, CDs with MP3s on them, and does a much better job of it than my old Toshiba 2200.  The picture is better than the older Toshiba, sharper and smoother with much better color.  Try the enhanced black level setting in the setup menu - it makes things look better on my Trinitron.  It's also very slim, as the name suggests, if you care about that kind of thing.  You can probably get better performance out of a more expensive player, but I haven't seen anything better at this price."
2910,"Sadly the seller sold me a slightly deffective item, in that the telscoping lense,gets stucks inside the camera,and therefore it shuts Down with code 18 ! Means the lense is not coming put ALL the Way. I managed to use vaseline and lubricate it the exterior and usedthe CRC contact cleaner to clean any dust or debris inside the delicate mechanism.I was to place a Negative feedback to the seller, But Iopted to keep my mouth SHUT ! Just keep an eye of this sellers that are Selfish and sells bad items just  to make some Dirty Profits,taking advantage of the Ignorants."
2911,The router seems to work fine although I haven't stretched its range yet.  BUT the documentation is nonexistence and support is awful.  the CD won't work in a mac and there are not even any preliminary instructions such as what to plug what into what if you can't open the CD.  It would be very easy for them to make this product more user friendly.  too bad they don't bother.  But the price was good and it works.
2912,"Since I replaced all the RCA audio cables on my DJ system with these,  I find that I don't have to turn up the volume on my power amp as much as I had to with the factory packed wires. The Sound is a lot more transparent. I hear stuff that I could not hear with  previous crappy RCA's. Bass is tighter, High's and Mid's are clearer. If you're gonna spend good money on your audio equipment , do yourself a favor and buy Good Audio cables to get the  most out of your system. Don't know why I did not do this sooner!Hope this Helps"
2913,"this is my first pda..and I rarely use it, so I'm not a good one to review it..but it was fairly easy to figure out.. Getting  photos into the pda from my computer was sort of complicated but I did it,  and still have not figured out how to get the photos in to the computer..  the camera is pretty convenient but not great  so don't plan to use it for important photos.. it is a fun little unit and certainly worth what I paid for it.  I bought it used"
2914,"Wanting for some time to get a better view of the stars, and motivated by the excellent reviews posted here at Company A, I purchased these binoculars two weeks ago. I cannot pretend to write about their performance from a seasoned veteran's perspective; rather, I just wish to point out to other newbies like me who are interested in making this purchase that they will definitely have to invest in a tripod. You simply will not be able to remain focused on any celestial objects using these with your hands and arms alone: the images will zigzag around within your field of view at the speed of light. Unfortunately, I have not yet purchased a tripod, because the compatible Celestron tripod here at Company A has been horribly reviewed, and because no information is included on what sort of tripod is compatible, and I don't know what my other options are. This means that I haven't really been able to enjoy the binoculars. I also wish to warn potential buyers that these binoculars, unlike Celestron's famed telescopes, are MADE IN CHINA! You will not be supporting U.S. technological labor by making this purchase."
2915,"Well for the performance for a small room, this is great.  nice deep tones; clear.  Be aware however, this is pretty big and heavy.  But again, those two items should not diminish the performance this sub woofer delivers."
2916,"Good Sony headphone. Its what I expect from Sony, great sounding. I wish the ear cushions were a bit larger."
2917,"I own a laptop computer which has decent onboard sound capabilities, but I recently discovered that it only has one audio input -- a microphone jack -- which is mono, and therefore is not suitable for recording stereo sources. Due to the fact that there is no way to install a &quot;real&quot; sound card in it, I needed an external solution. This USB sound system from Creative fits the bill. It didn't make a dramatic -- or even noticable -- difference in the quality of the audio coming out of my speakers; however, it did allow me to digitize my old cassette tapes and vinyl records, which is the main reason I bought it. If your computer can't accomodate a real sound card and its audio abilities aren't good enough for what you need, this might be the solution you're looking for."
2918,"i wanted to listen to my home stereo with my little pod type [ in ear] headphones, i use with my computer, so i bought this adapter. it works perfectly. now when the kids want to watch tv i can still mellow out with my tunes ! cheaper than buying another set of headphones ,,, i found the price to be very reasonable and have had no problems with quality."
2919,"I bought this back in the beginning of '04 at the ridiculous price of $1199.99...you can get a 50"" Plasma cheaper today! Other than paying way too much back then I must say that 6 years later the LCD is still working perfectly fine with only 1 dead pixels. The only complaint I'd have now is that its not as bright as today's LCD monitors. I have a newer 20"" Midnight set up right next to it and you can definitely see a brightness difference. I recommend this monitor if you can find it used for $50-60. Any more then that and you might as well buy a new widescreen LCD.01.13.14: Well 14 years later and it still works fine..gave it to my sister. Not that anyone cares lol."
2920,"This is a beefy arm.  I bought this and it turns out it's WAY overkill for what I needed.  Could've done with the medium duty one.  This one is at least 1/2&#34; thick and is really tough to move around.  But once something is placed, it stays there.  It's almost too heavy for the clamp I bought though, since the arm itself ways a pound or so."
2921,"For its size and weight, this is a nice little tripod. Great for backpacking. The included ball head is much easier to set than multi-axis style heads but you have to make sure it is securely tightened before you let go. I've got a bigger Slik tripod that is taller and sturdier for use at home, but this one is great for hikes.Slik (as well as Manfrotto, Bogen and Gitzo) is a true photographer quality tripod. It's in a completely different league than Velbon."
2922,"Plenty of room for camera and 2 lenses that came in  kit, plus one large 100-300 mm manual focus lens, plus all the extras; batteries, SD cards, lens filters, etc. Plus has a place to attach tripod.I was hoping it would be waterproof enough to give protection when canoeing. Probably will, unless the boat turns over, which is always a possibility when paddling.Appears to be well made and well designed."
2923,"This bag was better then I expected it to be, although it is not the ""Perfect"" bag. At first I did not think my stuff would fit, but it did.The quality of the bag is decent, but it is a little scary that the only thing holding in thousands of $ of equipment is a crappy little zipper."
2924,"I prefer the standard twist hood mounts, but as the nifty 50 doesn't have one the mechanism this uses is ok.  As was already stated it is a bit shallow.  The retention buttons annoy me a bit because I tend to squish the hood as I'm trying to take it off which makes it harder to take off, but they did good for what they had.  I do wonder why canon couldn't make an adapter with standard twist instead of this though.4 stars due to shallowness and the odd mount."
2925,"I do not really have much to say for this product, but it is just another good cannon product. The only thing i wish was that it came stock with my camera."
2926,"The switch performs well.  Several reviewers complain about the price but assuming Canon tests this item as thoroughly as they do their other products, I expect this item will give me years of trouble free service.  China probably makes a cheaper version but there is no assurance that it will not crack or fail due to poor molding or cheaply made parts.  I will pay the extra cost and have confidence in Canon's ability to develop, test and market quality products."
2927,"You want reach?  You want weather sealing?  Here it is.  Too bad there is some obvious image degradation.  This is my second copy.  It seems to work better (that is to say I don't notice the IQ difference as much) than the first one, however, so I am pleased about that.  It's an inexpensive and cost-effective way to gain a little reach and it only costs one stop of light, so for the most part, it's worth it.  Recommended."
2928,"This is the second addition of L glass to my collection. I primarily bout this lens to replace the 18-55 kit lens and have not looked back since. It is a little spendy but when I decide to upgrade to a full frame bode this focal length will be perfect. The sharpness of the lens is awesome. At f4 its not terrific under low light, but I mainly shoot on a tripod. Handheld with decent light its just fine, and produces stellar images. The L-glass has a different coloring than regular zooms that can be comparable to a prime lens. for the price of this lend and the other two lens in the similar focal range this is a great lens, if your budget is up for the 1200 dollar range (15-35,24-70)."
2929,"We use this to clean 8mm film that comes in to our studio.  Other than the fact that we get high as a kite when we forget to turn on the fans while using this product (lesson learned: VENT WELL), this does a great job at removing dust and hairs from 50+ years of build up on the films.Wish there was a better applicator for this product, just don't know what it would be.  We use the lint free pads that the same company makes and rather than ""spraying"" it on the pad, we dab the cloth with the cap off."
2930,"Perfect sacrificial UV Haze filter, no aberrations or optical characteristics to speak of.  At this price you really cannot go wrong.  Buy extras!"
2931,"Ultraviolet filters don't mean much in terms of actually filtering ultraviolet light any more -- that's a product of the old days of film, and DSLRs don't need that any more. What I use mine for - and what most people do - is as a protection for my much more expensive lenses. And for that, this is a great filter.The glass on the filter is sturdy and clear; I notice no difference between a photo taken with this filter on and one taken with it off, and that is exactly what I want."
2932,This is a great way to carry around all of those little details you no longer remember.Nice display but be sure to buy a screen protector and an extra stylus.
2933,Using it with Lumix GF-1Never had an issue with stability yet. One of the 3 legs isn't as snappy as the others though.
2934,I bought this for my factory head unit replacement project. I had to pry the female end just a bit to get the end attached to my receiver to fit but other than that I'd say it's a pretty good fit.
2935,Does an excellent job picking up AM stations at our home in Costa Rica. I recommend it for areas with weak radio signals.
2936,Excellent value for the price. The height is acceptable and its weight makes it easyto carry it around with little extra load on your pack. make sure to get the level with it
2937,"The only reason I am a lithe hard on this tripod is that I had a Canon one very similar in size and build and all the parts on the Canon one just seem smoother and sturdier.  However, having said that, this tripod has thus far worked as it should.  The huge plus about this is that if you lose the mount you can locate replacement ones.  Canon was so difficult and so annoying that I refused to look any longer and just got this tripod, which comes with two mounts and is almost as much as any possible replacement mount solution for Canon.For sheer workability, it definitely works well, but the plastic pieces seem a little iffy and the clamps are so-so.  However, none have broken or malfunctioned to stop use, but I worry that will be the downfall of the tripod.  For the price, it is a great fix though and I wouldn't mind having to buy one every 1-3 years or until I can afford a really nice one."
2938,"This is a very sturdy tripod. I love it, the movement is a little slow, but VERY smooth. I think this will last me a while."
2939,"This is a nice antenna I found three stations I did not know about, one of them goes from very good reception to none , but I will blame that on the station itself not the antenna"
2940,"The RCA ANT121 High Quality Durable Passive Indoor Antenna does what it is supposed to do which is provide increased reception for local channels. Set up is fast and easy which is accomplished by plugging the antenna into the antenna connection on your television. Then, make sure your television is set to &#8220;antenna&#8221; and not cable otherwise it will NOT pick up any stations. The next step is to perform an automatic scan on your television to pick up new stations. I ended up with 24 stations but ended up deleting some of them manually because I will never watch the station. I now get all of the local television stations although one is very pixilated and I haven&#8217;t yet figured out how to remedy this situation.Overall Assessment:The RCA ANT121 High Quality Durable Passive Indoor Antenna is fast and easy to set up. I now get local stations which was my goal."
2941,"Although I ordered this tripod to be used with a Pico Projector, I found that it was too small to balance the projector.  It will work great in other applications and it was ""Cheap"" to buy."
2942,"Both filters seem to be high quality. This is my first polarized filter, and I am impressed with its performance, but have nothing to compare it to. My only issue is that the polarizer can be very difficult to remove from the UV filter if you tighten it too much. It also may turn too easily, but it has not been a problem so far.I needed a UV filter to protect my lens, and for just a few dollars more, I got this set, so I would say it is a great value."
2943,"These speakers play much bigger than either their price or their size. Clean. Clear. And accurate playback of recordings are all pluses, with a nice tonally balanced sound. Very smooth sound with all  types of music. Would definitely buy again"
2944,"If you just want to upgrade your notebook's hard drive there is no simpler way to do it. Insert the new drive in the enclosure (no need to close it up) and run the application from the CD. With the click of a mouse it will clone the old drive to the new drive in minutes. As long as there is some life left in your old drive it works great. Just don't use it for going from a spinner (hard drive) to an SSD because there is a possibility that you won't get TRIM support. TRIM is needed to preserve the life of a SSD and get full performance and usually only installs with a fresh Windows installation. On the other hand you can go SSD to SSD just fine because Windows is expecting an SSD.Where it comes up short is that it is for notebooks only - you have to use their 2.5"" enclosure to do the clone. You can't just hook up drives via conventional cables and clone - it won't do it. The enclosure is required. One star off for a designed in limitation. As long as you understand that limitation I recommend it."
2945,"I  know that his prouct has been slammed by others, but I find that it really works well for me (saved my The Man in the Iron Mask dvd).  I put a very sparing amount of the solution on the disk, turn the knob for about 20 seconds and always use the mini wiper (in an outward circular motion) to clean all the disks and I have never had a problem.  I even got a couple of pretty well worn disks from Netflix that other cleaners prior would have left still unable to be viewed all the way thorugh and t hey have played well and clear after using Optifix.  I suggest that if you are looking for a cleaner, you give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised by the results."
2946,These are very good binoculars for the price.  They have a solid feel with the rubberized coating and are easy to focus.
2947,which version of this lens is better the one with the built in motor or the non built in motor?
2948,"Actually I got a much better deal on these speakers at CircuitCity - they had them on sale right before Christmas for $99.00, plus with a mail in rebate of $40.00 if purchased by 12/24 - bringing my total out of pocket cost for these speakers to $49.00.  Quite a steal.  Setup was clear and quick.  I really find the external wired volume control/headphone jack/USB port to be very handy.  I wish the speaker cables were a little longer, but for most applications they should be fine.  Overall, very nice speakers."
2949,"It does the job correctly and on top of that, it was really inexpensive.  I needed to split my line to a fax and this works perfectly!"
2950,"The inverter is compacted, has the power rating and dual plugs to make it very handy for most any device combos I will be using in my car (estimated less than 200w continuous). It is well build, uses PWM for wave form generation to be compatible with a wide range of electronic equipment and comes at a great price.  An invertor can be had for less and you would get less. That would have given it 5 stars.Why not 5 stars?  It will be used inside the car and the fan noise is noticeable if it is right next to you (BTW, it is epoxed in place so it doesn't rattle). If I had gotten a 150W unit, it would have been fanless.  I wanted the headroom. So it had to have a fan (and putting it under the seat with road noise), it is an acceptable trade-off.  I did get the 12v Battery clip-on adapter just in case I need to take it to the max (protected by a 40A automotive fuse to deal with the 600W peak).  Now we will see how long it lasts.  I have high hopes if Tripp Lite lives up to their name."
2951,"This filter performed flawlessly on a recent cruise to Alaska. Water and glass reflections were almost completely eliminated. The thin design allowed me to keep my UV protection filter on while using it without any noticable vignetting. The only problem I  noticed - the outer ring is very thin, which can make it tough to operate."
2952,The worse part of having a card reader is it seems to become obsolete each year. None of the two Sandisk card readers I have support SDHC.
2953,"I bought this keyboard/mouse set after buying a new PC over 2 years ago, and I have not had much trouble at all.  Yes, the mouse does go through the batteries quicker than the keyboard, but then most people use the mouse much more than the keyboard.As far as the keyboard strokes not being recognized by the computer, well that is a minor and easy fix.  It really depends on where the sensor is at.  I had some issues and it turned out that the books sitting next to it had fallen over and blocked the sensor.  Once I moved the sensor over a bit the problem was solved.If you read the info on this product it says that you will only get about 6 feet from the sensor to work.  If you are looking for more distance than a different set up is probably your best bet.  I would not say to avoid this set at all.  It has been working well for quite a long time now, and other than battery replacement, and moving the sensor every so often, I have not had ANY problems with it, and I use this everyday for many hours a day (8-12+) for work and graduate school.I would have given it 5 stars except for the twitchy sensor.  Realize that anything electronic these days goes through batteries at varying rates with the amount of use.  I have replaced the batteries on the keyboard 3 times in 2 years and 4 or 5 times on the mouse, but again I use the mouse more than the keyboard (as do most people in the general population). This is a good deal for the price. It is worth the investment.I also like that it is compatible with Mac, so when I upgrade to a MacPro in the next few months, I can keep using it.Update***3 December 2009I am still using this keyboard and mouse, and still have no complaints on usability and length of battery life.  Still works great with my Mac and PC and the Iogear KVM switch."
2954,"I have been nothing but satisfied with my PX-708A. It's error protection technology seems to function flawlessly, but it does slow down the burning process when enabled. If speed is what you are looking for, then look elsewhere. But if a quality, error-free burn is more important to you than speed, then this burner should please you. I have used Mitsui, Sony, and Iomega discs with this burner with no problems at all."
2955,"This one isn't as good as myNZXT CRYO LX Aluminum Notebook Cooler, but then, it doesn't cost as much either. I use this one on my budget laptop and the NZXT on my more expensive 18"" one.  The blue LED on this Antec is surprisingly bright though, so I covered it with some electrical tape.  Still going strong after 3 years.  It does the job and is affordable too.  Fit's my 15"" laptop perfectly."
2956,"Knocked a star off for limited cold weather durability but for the price this device does a good job at keeping cords and Christmas light in good order. I've used these before and my only complaint is the cord catch on the middle of the reel is not too sturdy for heavy gauge cords, especially when cold weather is in full swing."
2957,Nothing special but it does what it needs to do. I wanted this to protect my glass more than anything.  I usually take it off when shooting indoors but a few times I have forgotten and I really can not tell that it is on my lens.
2958,"The purchase and delivery process was uneventful. The pictures taken with the filter on look good. However, it is difficult to clean the dust and tiny broken fibers off from the filter as they stuck on the corner. I don't even know where they came from.(probably from the new camera bag?) I had to use a rocky blast to do the job."
2959,"It's hard to get excited about a filter that is supposed to protect the front element of your camera lens, but so far, this one is transparent and I never notice it - perfect for everyday use."
2960,"It's neither soft or cushiony. It's grippy rubber, so it's great to use as a shoulder strap. It's pretty uncomfortable as a neck strap. Can it be done? Yes, I used it around my neck for days but I had a jacket. If it's against your skin, good luck!"
2961,"Work well and as advertised, but each motor connector/circuit borad connector is open, exposed, and fragile.  Should have enclosures around each motor unit."
2962,works great with my laptop when I travel its easy to carry and I know that when I am in a hotel or a friends house my stuff is protected.
2963,"I just got mine and set it up per the instructions, on my windshield. I set it to take me from the Simi Valley to a remote location in the Los Angeles hills. It mapped me right there. I found my current location while I was still in my garage. When I went a different way than suggested, it remapped in seconds and had me back on track. It gives warnings about turn offs 2 miles before and then  mile before. If you come up on an intersection, the warnings are to stay on the current road, incase you were thinking to taking one of the freeway interchanges and shouldn't. Even in extremely cloudy conditions and through hilly areas, it kept me on track. There was one point where the indicator was red, meaning it wasn't getting a signal, but it still had my location and gave me directions... how does it do that? All and all, I love it. I wish I had it years ago. I'm much less afraid of getting lost and far more apt to taking an alternate route during traffic hours with this little wonder. Though it is extremely expensive, for me, it's worth it. I got mine at Costco's, but it was the same price as Company A by the time I added on my locale tax and shipping. I searched the internet to see if I could find a cheaper price, but I didn't find one. As a matter of fact, I found prices up to $2000 for the same unit with nothing extra. I've seen reviews of people complaining about mounts for the car. Mine came with everything. The window mount is excellent. I took it though some pretty rough areas and it was very secure and always in view but never obstructed my driving view. I didn't take it out of L.A. yet, but in areas I can't get cell phone signal, I was able to get GPS signal. But you can always view the different directions manually, if you should ever lose signal, so it's not like you are without maps or directions. If you have the money, I say it is money well spent!"
2964,"The 16 discs I've burned & printed so far all worked very well, no problems at all.  And, they have a white printable area, which gives much nicer results than the silver-printable variety.These have standard (40mm) non-printable centers.  Had I given it more thought, I'd have ordered ""hub-printable"" discs instead, which have smaller (20mm) non-printable centers and permit the creation of nicer, more professional-looking labels.  Of course, I don't know whether such discs would be as reliable as the Maxells or show the printing as well as these do."
2965,"This review is for the Sony KF50WE610:Pros: 1. Almost the best picture...comparing to current plasma's and other DLp/LCD project TV's.2. Definitely better than any rear projection TV and slim enough to save you that extra space.3. Easy to move and setup.4. No burnout issues.5. HD Picture is the best, when compared to other TV's.Cons: 1. Uses a replaceable projection lamp which may need to be replaced more frequently than you would think. I have had this TV for 7 months, but the bulb is still going strong.2. I have heard about issues with TV making sounds when starting immediately after switching off. I have noticed that too, but dont think it really matters.3. Black portions of the picture are not entirely black as you would think, but this is also noticeable only if you watch extremely carefully in night scenes. I have had some success by tweaking the &quot;Picture&quot;, &quot;Brightness&quot;, &quot;Color&quot; and &quot;Sharpness&quot; controls.Overall, a very good TV, but I would have given it 5 stars if it was a little less priced and did not have the replacement lamp issue."
2966,"I purchased this to replace a failing cable modem, and I'm very impressed. Had it up and running within 10 minutes of opening the box. Wireless works great, no problem. It doesn't support WPA, so if you're going to do anything interesting with the wireless (i.e. banking or shopping) you should use the 128bit WEP, turn off the SSID broadcast, use MAC address restriction, and change the key every couple of weeks. It's still vulnerable, but most attackers will go after a softer target. Overall a great device."
2967,"I purchased this extension tube because I wanted to try out macro photography without spending a small fortune in new lenses. I've tried it with a few different lenses, including the 50mm Canon 1.8f prime lens, The 70-200mm 2.8f Canon L lens, and a Tamron 17-55 2.8 lens.  The extension tube works well with all of them. Autofocusing was a little sketchy (especially in lower light situations)- I recommend using manual focus. The lens tube is very easy to put in your camera (just like any other lens), and it is also quite simple to connect and disconnect your lens. It's a great addition to my kit and will be nice to have around when I spot a good opportunity for a close up macro shot."
2968,"I have yet to push this unit to anywhere near what is able to do. I live in a apartment with my wife and young child. So max, even mid volume is out of the question. The sound is good and really adds to the movies that we watch at home."
2969,"I needed a reasonably decent tripod for a Canon EOS 30D with a 70-300mm zoom tele lens, but I didn't want to break the bank. I decided on this one after reading the other reviews. I am quite pleased with this item. The head operates smoothly and locks down solidly. I often use it extended to near max height. It is very stable despite that extension. This is a very good tripod for the money. I have no reservations about recommending it to others."
2970,"Having owned 3 other wireless headphones, I'd have to say I liked these the best.  If you treat them with the care that any electronic product deserves, they will provide you with reliable service.  If you drop them they will probably break, so will my portable DVD player.  The sound quality is excellent.  No they won't compete with $200-plus phones.  But for under $75. these phones are as good as you can expect. I highly recommend them."
2971,This is perfect for a preteen or teenager. But sound could be improved a little and dialing in the stations are harder than another form of scanning the spectrum of AM/FM radio.This is what our granddaughter asked for but we probably would have bought something else if we'd gone looking.She's happy so it really doesn't matter what we think is right .
2972,"It works.I don't like how, as I squeeze it the blowy end kind of turns and moves off in another direction.Small complaint, I could just squeeze it less, but there are other products that you can squeeze and it will keep blowing on the same spot."
2973,"GPSMAP 60cs is a nice unit but if you can wait for their next generation handheld, you should.  I recently did a 2000 mile motorcycle trip along with several back country hiking excursions and for the normal kinds of things you want a gps to do, (where am I, how do I get there, what direction am I going) the 60CS was great!  With CitySelect maps I could see all the roads, even the dirt roads in obscure places like the south western Oregon National forests. I routinely used autonav and it's amazingly fast route calculations made getting to where I wanted to be a real pleasure....almost....You can display lots of fancy data on almost any of the screens.The sat pickup is far better then the earlier gpses and fast.A real compass and altimeter made off trail hiking a breezeEstimated arrival times and popup turn notifications kept me on my path.However....Don't come upon a road block.  There is no way to tell autorouting that you must detour.  You have to coax autonav to get you around the road blockage by trying to find other road waypoints to build partial routes, When you are in the middle of no where, this is not pleasant.  Garmins answer:  Buy a bigger more expensive unit.Don't rely on the 'save tracks' feature.  Garmin drops all of the date/time stamps from the active track when it saves it for you (forget about photo gps tagging).  They claim it takes to much space (dah? the unit has 56MB!, a track entry is under a couple hundred characters even with date/time!)Don't use the belt hanger knob on the back.  My first use caused the knob to snap off a part of the back housing leaving a 1/2 diameter hole!  Since the knob is used by their auto and bicycle mounts, be ware, you may see your garmin bouncing on the street or down by your feet!"
2974,"The resolution indoors was not fantastic, but expected.  However, I noticed some other reviewer complaining about the batteries being difficult to find because of the special need for a specific battery type.This is not true.I plugged in plain old Duracell cheapos and it worked fine.  Do not hesitate to buy this camera because of this complaint, because it is a false complaint.The camera works very nice for the price, and traveling with it is easy and you don't worry too much about it getting stolen, cause it ain't worth much.Also, don't worry about the SD disk that someone else complained about, they are available in most stores (Target, Wal-Mart) as well as here on Company A, look it up."
2975,"I don't think it is possible to find a better multimedia speaker deal for under $40.00.  The speakers set up easily and, despite their looks, can stay fairly inconspicuous.  I have mine set up on top of our armoir withsome decorative plants to hide the sub.  I am using this with the excellent AirPort Express to pipe my iTunes collection into the living room."
2976,but a little heavy.  I wish it were a lighter. otherwise its been a solid rf headphones and great for not disturbing others.
2977,"I have been using this for the past 3+ months. I bought this to watch TV quietly. Everything works great except loosing signal at times. Doesn't happen very often. When it happens, I will just reset the frequency.There are much better products in the market. But if you are looking for an economical options, this is the one to GO.Hope this helps.Mathew."
2978,"These headphones are great, and they're backed by an excellent company that knows pro-audio. However, I've experienced a good amount of static (depending on which way I pivot my head) and the fit is less than desirable. They're a bit bulky and will fall off if I look down. But overall, I like them. They've got great sound quality and they allow me to roam around while listening to music or podcasts."
2979,"I bought this lens for my EOS 20D. Before this lens, I was using EOS 28-135mm lens. After the upgrade, I found that 28-300mm lens give me almost distortion free image even at 300mm range. When I used 28-135mm lens, the distortion on the image is very visible when I am at 135mm range. Even at the wide angle range, I noticed that 28-300mm lens gives me much sharper image while 28-135mm lens gives me much softer image. The focus is very fast for 28-300mm L lens. On the down side, this 28-300mm lens is really heavy. Holding it will really wear you out. The auto/manual focus switch is arranged in a very awkard position. It is very easy to change your auto foucs setting to manual setting. The lens also will be pulled all the way down due to its weight when you carry it around. I have to carry it with my hand and not make it extend  itself all the way down. If picture quality is what you are after, go for this lens. I am very pleased with the sharpness and  the fast focusing."
2980,"I bought 4 of these and the container is easy to tell that its genuine, the container has canon halograms on it.So it makes you fell save.The terminal cover has a hole that you can invert to indicate if its full or drained out."
2981,I have found these cases very convenient.  I particularly like that I can store two CD/DVDs in one small space.
2982,"I would give this a five-star except for the fact it is a little too tight to rewind the cord around the mouse and to click the USB port into position.  Often requires more than one try, and you also worry about streching out or breaking the cord.  -- My original review above was wriiten on Apr 2008.  Almost one year later, now the mouse ""died"" on me.  That is right, it does not work anymore.  Just thought i will share this -- 3/7/2009"
2983,"No other headsets, Plantronics or other, have equalled the volume and clarity of this one.  I have bought 3 now, and will buy this model until they quit making it."
2984,Good speakers for my patio.
2985,"Just got this. It's very roomy, I could probably put two faceplates in there if I wanted to. No interior pockets or dividers, so if you want to put additional items inside (like a cable or a few USB Flash Drives), beware of potentially scratching the faceplate.The description says NYLON, but most of the case is made of that mysterious ""fake-leather"" ""fake-rubber"" material which I would never call nylon (although I am not an industrial expert on synthetic materials). Only an insert (about 25% of the case) next to the logo is made of what I would call nylon. This is the reason I took away one star, because I am pretty sure this ""fake rubberized leather"" is not as durable as most grades of nylon.But otherwise well-deserved 4 stars, I'm sure I will enjoy using it.p.s. beware of price fluctuations! as of now (the time of this review) it costs twice what I paid for it 10 days ago."
2986,"I purchased this for $20 to use with my son's 20G PS3. He now has wireless internet access for gaming, browsing and PS3 software updates. It took less than 5 minutes to get it up and running on our wireless network. I would recommend this for anyone who owns the 20G PS3 (no wireless built in)."
2987,works as expected but tuning on an analog display is tricky. Especially on this small radio. However once you are tuned reception is good and sound quality is OK (considering this is a pocket radio).I use it on my desk while I work and 99% of the time I'm tuned to the same station so this is perfect for me. If you change stations more frequently I would consider a digital tuning radio.
2988,Kinyo vhs tape 2 way rewinder I've used for many years of daily operation. I own hundreds of vhs tape and used this rewinder a lot. I bought this brand based on my past experience with Kinyo rewinder's performance.
2989,"The modules work well, however, they do NOT 'fade-in' or 'fade-out' the lamp bulbs as advertised for this model."
2990,"What is there to say about something like this? NIC's have been around since networks came about, and perhaps in the early days of a 10/100 card their were a few manufacturers to avoid, but today many use the same chip, slap it on their board and it works just like another one would. I needed a Gigabit PCI NIC to connect my media PC to wireless router and when the price dropped I picked it up, it arrived, I plugged it in and Windows 7 took care of the rest of the installation. No regrets."
2991,This was for my wife's computer so it needed to be quiet. Moves a lot of air. Appears to well made. Hard to find in this size. But then it was for an HP....so of course it's a weird size.
2992,Performs well. A low cost alternative to hide box in another rooms and control wall mounted tv and the cable box
2993,"good product, good reliable company, good price.  what more is there to say, really?i'm using this card mostly with a pocketPC, to run my GPS software.  so far its run smoothly without a hiccup, and has tons of left over space i can use for more programs or whatever."
2994,"I bought the Haking, Belkin and Keyspan Tripplite. The Keyspan Tripplite was just a pain. There was a recent driver on their website for Mac but no instructions on what to do with it. When I downloaded and doubleclicked it, Mac OS tried to open it with Text Edit. The Belkin was better but auto-connect and disconnect just didn't work right. I'd have to wait what felt like a minute or more for a print out to come out after the auto-connect connected. Even when manually connected I still could not use the scanner. No thank you.The Hawking was the smallest, cheapest and easiest to install. It worked first try and even with my office's VPN-connected XP laptop. Unlike the Belkin, I didn't have to play with firewall rules. My only gripe is that it does not have a driver for Mac so to print from my Mac I have to manually unplug the USB cable from the server and plug it in to the back of the Mac, then plug the printer back into the server when done. I emailed support several days ago asking for a Mac driver and never heard from them. I have multiple computers connected to my router, wired and wireless. They all auto-connect and print fine using the Hawking print server with my Canon MFP 4150. So far I've had to manually connect to scan when initiating the scan from the printer. That makes sense. If the request comes from the printer instead of one of the PCs, how should the USB server know which one to connect it to. There is a ""network scanner"" button in the user interface. I have not played enough with it yet.As long as you don't care that it's not Mac, Linux or Unix compatible, I recommend it."
2995,"Bought it for an outside birthday party at night.  The movie showed up very well after the sun went down.  It sets up easy, it's easy to carry.  The one thing I would change would be the position of the tripod legs so that the rear leg wasn't pointing straight back.  Instead have one pointing straight forward and the two rear legs at an angle, then it would be easier to have the screen closer to the wall and maximize room space a little better."
2996,"Ive tried a few stands for my laptop, and this, the cheapest option, is the only one which has worked. Its very simple. It simply elevates the back of the laptop to allow the laptops own fan to work.Pros: cheap, it works great on a hard surface.Cons: smaller than laptop base, so not good if the laptop Is on your lap."
2997,"Have used the entire stack for spoken audio recordings and am pleased with the results.  No duds.I was just as pleased with the Company A brand cd's, but since they have raised the price on those, it looks like Verbatim will be my future in cd purchases.Only complaint I have with these and other inexpensive CD's is that their advertising on the cd itself makes reading my labeling more difficult."
2998,Excellent product. However the packaging for this product is the worst of all the items I have ever ordered. My CD stack came in broken and I had no time to return it....
2999,"This was pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I was a little wary because a lot of times you think you're getting one thing and you actually get another. (I personally think Company A needs to check that sellers have better, more accurate descriptions of what they're selling, but that's just my opinion.) But this product is exactly what it says it is. Buy away!"
3000,"The sound output isn't that great but keep in mind that most residential alarm system control panels allow for a combined output of about 700-1000 ma for sirens.  With a typical indoor and outdoor siren, this is about the most you can expect without adding auxiliary higher power siren drivers.The warble tone is the most effective IMHO.It's cheap and works.  ADT wanted around $100 for the same unit."
3001,A recommended item for ones lap top computer.  Much easier and comfortable to use than the mouse on the key board pad.
3002,"Works well, the cable is a bit stiff/bulky/unwieldyand the switch is too easily toggled by accident on stage.  Overall good item but could be improved."
3003,"When I first got these headphones and cranked up the first song, the sound was very stat-icky but after a couple of songs the smooth sound started to come through. These headsets put out pretty clean sound although if you're into rap or hip hop or a fan of the kind of music that is bass heavy, then these are not for you. I'm a pop music listener so these are perfect for me. Also, these do not come with the 3.5mm adapter that you would need to connect to your iPod, iPhone, ipad or other cell phones to listen to your mp3's. You do need to buy the adapter separately. Company A does sell the adapter for $8.99. Here's the link for it.Hosa Stereo Headphone Adapter - 1/4 inch to 1/8 inchhowever I bought the exact same adapter at a local store named Best something (Wink Wink) for 1/3 the price. If you like clean sound then these headphones are for you. If you like your music bass heavy then move on. By the way, these headphones are very very comfortable. The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because the headsets slide easily off my head. I would have preferred a little tighter grip."
3004,"They work, nothing wrong with them really. They've been around in the same configuration forever. I'd rate 5 stars if the little plastic clips that hold them together were a little stronger."
3005,"I was a little leary ordering 12 gauge at this price but when I received it I found out that this is really quality wire.I was also a little skeptic about replacing relatively short runs to my center channel and L/R (3 ft CC, 8 ft L/R) where I had very good 16 gauge cable with 12.  And if it would improve anything at all?Well, in this one time I've to say BOY WAS I WRONG!  Just replacing the cable has caused me to have to go back to a full audio recalibration with my audio meter.  Volumes that were in the 1/4 scale on my receiver are now at almost 1/8 scale and the base is just blowing things off the shelf.  My rear surround speakers (depressingly) were installed when the house was built with the 16 gauge wire so I can't do much there.  But I am going to run short jumpers from the amp to the wall connectors to complete the look.  It's a good thing that AMP and Receivers allow you to adjust the DB levels for front/rear because right now my THX and DBS calibrations are totally out the window!So for people that think that it's not worth going 12 or 10 gauge then rethink that thought.  For people that want to spend 4 times more on Monster cables go ahead, Monster will thank you all the way to the bank but you won't get your monies worth.  Get these and forget the higher prices.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is probably a feature that they advertise but for me was a pain.  The wire strands are literally so thin (probably a good thing for impedance) that I lost almost a foot of cable (all in all) because I would cut a little too deep and have a handful of wire on my floor.  I didn't want to run 12 gauge and then only connect 14 gauge to the amp so I kept cutting it back until I got a full bundle.  Maybe I should just have invested in a very good pair of 12 gauge strippers.Either way, This is great stuff.  And the clear coating and different colors make it super easy to maintain polarity."

3008,"900MHz is an old technology.  I owned my first 900MHz wireless headphone from about 10 years ago.  Apparently, things have not improved by much.  The audio quality of these headphones reminds me those really old radios from 20 years back.  There are constant audio artifacts from interference such as hissing, high-pitched whines, etc.If you accept the the fact that you are dealing with an old technology, I suppose this pair of headphones is not too bad.  If you want hifi, well, you will be disappointed.  The following is a list of pros and cons.Pros:1. Very comfortable headphones.2. One button auto-tuning.  You don't need to perform constant manual tuning like other wireless headphones.3. Decent sound quality if you manage to ignore the audio artifacts such as the hissing and whines.Cons:1. Custom rechargable batteries.  Don't you hate it when the manual tells you to get your batteries replaced by a dealer?  Right!  The total cost of replacement will probably make it infeasible.2. Uses 900MHz wireless technology.  See above.  Well, I searched around for headphones using other technologies and only found infrared implementations.  In this my understanding that infrared does not travel across walls, so the headphones are only useful if you are in line of sight of the transmitter.3. Useless surround sound feature.  Note that this is not Dolby Surround Sound, which decodes Dolby Surround encoded soundtracks.  The surround sound feature of this headphones just makes your music sounds muffled as if you were playing it in a large room with very bad acoustics.  Mercifully, this feature can be turned off.In conclusion, buy this pair of headphones if the convenience of wireless is an overwhelming consideration, otherwise pass on it."
3009,"I got it as a replacement power cord for my Aiwa boom box, CSD-EX10. Though the Aiwa has a tab inside the receptacle area to, presumably, make only their power cords fit, THIS cord will work just fine. It's a little snug but it does not stress the pins."
3010,"The trim ring feels a bit flimsy. I've had it in for a week and it seems good. It was straight forward to install. There are a bunch of tabs around it to mate up with different vehicles, and you have to cut of the ones that don't belong there for your application. A dremel tool with a cut off wheel would be handy. I managed with a  hack saw and being careful.The 1.5 DIN space is a pain to deal with. I like the small pocket space better than the alternative which is a flat piece of plastic that centers the 1 DIN radio in the middle. The small crevice is good for stuffing a map, directions, or the cord to your mp3 player.I'd prefer it was built a little stronger, but it was the best option out there for a Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ, and I'm happy with it so far."
3011,The headband from this headset works great with a pair of Koss KSC75 headphones. I only gave 4 stars because without the Koss mod they sound terrible. After snapping on the Koss parts you would never know they were not made this way. Just buy them both together from Company A and you will not be disappointed. Best for portables due to the short cord. Would buy again.i
3012,"You can easily spend double or triple the amount of cash on a fancy big-box store or Monster PDU.  Why?  Rarely if ever is someone going to see it.  This PDU is perfectly acceptable for the intended purpose.  I have mine mounted in my center console and it works great.  Not much to say here as it's a simple metal block essentially.  Value-wise, it can't be beat.  The big name brand (read: Monster, etc) PDUs are a ridiculous waste of money IMO.  They've perfected the art of selling you hype and brand name.  In any case, because of the price, it's really a no-brainer of extremely little risk.  My system sounds great.  As I'm OCD, I also used a little thread-lock compound on the screws to ensure no movement.  I've had zero problems and zero complaints."
3013,"I kinda just bought this one day on an impulse while upgrading the studio, because i never really had a dedicated subwoofer for mixing in bass and what-not. So when it arrived i was a little taken back, i have 12s in my trunk of my car, so i know how big a 10"" woofer is, but the box on this is serious.PROS:-Hits very hard for 100w/10"" woofer-Looks very clean (i have the black finish)-gain and freq cut off controls on the back are awesome, perfect for keeping your bass where you want it.-Feels sturdy, and well made.CONS:-Huge! i didnt expect this to be so large, check the dimensions before you buy if youre concerned about space.-limited inputs, make sure you have the cables/splitters/adapters required to plug it up on the spotIm very pleased with this buy, and its price, but i would recommend people who are looking to 'bass up' their sound to rearrange speakers, and work on levels before buying this. For those looking for slumping basslines, click add to cart now."
3014,"Count me as another person who was skeptical about a cable that costs only a couple of bucks working as well as one that costs ten times as much (or more). After reading other positive reviews, I decided that I wasn't risking much because of the low price. When the cables arrived, I used one to connect my new blu-ray player to my TV, and the other to connect my hi-def camcorder. I've never used an expensive cable, so I don't have a frame of reference, but I can't imagine how a cable could be worth ten times as much. The pictures seem perfect. Makes me wonder if the expensive cables are coming out of the same factories in China as these cheap ones are, but are just going through more markup channels along the way. The only minor complaint I have is that the fit seemed a bit tight when I plugged it in. Again, I don't have a frame of reference, so this may be normal. I guess a bit tight is better than loose. Right?"
3015,"Super fast delivery, great price. Don't believe the Monster Cable hype. This cable will handle your HD signal just fine - 720p, 1080i, 1080p, 120Hz, etc."
3016,"I was very pleased with the quality of the cables.  It did take a little longer than I expected to receive them, but it was only a little over a week.  The value is great! WalMart wanted $26.00 for a cable of the same quality. You can't beat this deal!"
3017,"Good cable, does what it's supposed to. Shielding a little to thick and bulky. Difficult to manage or bend. Good buy for money."
3018,"Don't let sellers tell you hdmi cables aren't all the same, they are! Works great."
3019,"A bit stiff, but still a good cable, especially for the price.  Would buy again.  No need for expensive cables, just get this one."
3020,Excellent DVDs. I am a videographer and editor and shoot projects which can not fit on a single layer disk. Sometimes the projects can be 2hrs plus. So I needed a brand of DVD's that would hold that amount of content and hold up well. I am satisfied with this product. Will purchase more.
3021,"Bought these after having a bad experience with Memorex dual layer media.  These have been perfect, not a single coaster.  Avoid Memorex like the plague.  I wish the price on DL media would come down some more, but otherwise this product is great."
3022,I am no audio pro but these are comfortable and work well for my applications such as listening to music and gaming. These are adjustable and the mic is easy to flip out of the way.
3023,"Sound is as good as higher name brands like monster, but that can't change very much for these cables. I hooked it up from my PS3 to surround sound and it works like a charm the only worry I have is the very inexpensive build quality. This one may be much less than others but it certainly will not last as long if it is moved around a lot. But if it is staying in one place for a long time then it's a great deal."

3025,"When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package.  It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of ""professional"" Lexar cards.  My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly.My only complaint is in the card's reliability.  After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera.  Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter).  The image ""rescue"" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either.Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since.  However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken.  Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since."
3026,"This works flawlessly with the Xplore M98 smartphone ([...]I have also used it with Palm's latest Centro PalmOS based smartphone.I find it better to use this one rather than a bluetooth one because of one simple reason: BATTERY LIFE.When you use Bluetooth, you're activating yet another two way RF radio inside the phone, which drains the battery A LOT.With an IR device, the Palm is a PASSIVE receiver of the IR beams sent by the keyboard, which is in turn powered by two AAA batteries.I said ""but...""  on the review title. And that's because the tiny ""arm"" that holds the IR transmitter can only get up, say 100 degree radius from the device. And Palm changed the location of the IR port in the Centro from top (traditional on early PDAs) to the right side on the Treo 680 and the Centro as well.That means that you cannot use it on the centro UNLESS you place the IR arm at the rightmost position, AND you tilt the centro a bit to the left. Just a bit.Of course, being a hardcore hardware hacker, I jut cut a hole the same diameter of an index finger on the plastic case that didn't let the arm move a bit further to the right. This way the IR emitter aims directly at the Centro's IR port while being perfectly vertically aligned.Hope this helps.FC"
3027,"This is a good quality lens available for under 300$. The optical characteristics and build quality are excellent and I wouldn't dig deeper into them, since it's best left to the pros. Summarizing my experience with this lens and a canon APSC body esp targeting it to the non-professionals looking at this lens:1) Goes from f2.8 to f45. The large f-number is really helpful since achieving the desired depth of field in macro photography can be tricky.2) Good for portraits as well: The lens does perform good for portraits as well. But I wouldn't buy this lens primarily for that. If portraits is what one is looking for then the canon 50mm 1.8Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lensbeats this lens hands down. It has a larger aperture (f1.8) and costs in the sub 100$ range. I would recommend buying that even if you have this lens.3) Good focusing for macro objects. A lot of lens' find it tough to focus on objects close by. This lens on the other hand performs verg well on the autofocus front.4) Perspective and focusing distance: This is probably the most important feature which should determine your buying choice. It's not technically a feature or an attribute but it was one of the key reasons why I let go of this lens. While using a lens in the 50mm focal range, to get 1:1 magnification you have to be too close to the subject. This may be a concern if you are photographing insects/critters since they tend to be distracted by an object so close to them. Also, the focal length also limits the applications of this lens to very small flowers or objects, try clicking a larger object and the perspective you get just isn't pleasing enough. I found that using a longer focal length lens, provides a much tighter background, a much better subject separation (foreground is well lit and separated vis-a-vis the background) and overall a much better aesthetic appeal.Apparent depth of field is also much shallower using a longer lens leading to better photos than this.5) Comparisons with other setups:a) Compared against the 50mm1.8 + Extension tubesCanon EF 12 II Extension Tube For EOS Digital Cameras(Or try using third party extension tubes which are much cheaper) I have tried macro using the 50mm canon with extension tubes. I found the results were much more pleasing as compared to this lens, primarily the perspective is much better. Focusing though, is much tougher using the extension tubes and the sigma wins hands down as long as focusing is concerned.b) Compared with the sigma apo-dg macro 70-300.Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG APO Macro Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR CamerasThe sigma zoom offers a macro mode when it's in the 200-300 mm focal range. I found that my best work has come out of using this configuration primarily because it offers the perspective which I so desire. Focusing is a big issue however with this lens in macro mode. (Lot of focus scan which leads to very fast battery drain)Summary: Overall, I would recommend buying a 100mm or longer zoom lens. I believe that the longer focal range provides a perspective and background separation which makes taking aesthetically appeasing photos much easier."
3028,"This is a great scanner for beginners, the reason why I say for beginners is that it doesn't go upto the 800mhz frequencies.  And it all depends on your area, but where we leave the ground channels, when a fire box/alarm hits it goes to the ground station which is in teh 800 frequencies so guess what we can't get it on this radio. But the sound is great, and it's a perfect size and works wonderfully.  Easy to program and easy to use."
3029,"We received the precise OEM replacement along with original APC manuals.  It is an exact duplicate of the battery it is replacing, the original that came with our APC unit.  This replacement was supplied by Company A.Some of the negative reviews here appear to be direct to non APC marked batteries supplied by third party suppliers that are not shipping genuine APC.  If you buy this from Company A, and supplied by Company A, be assured that what you receive is the battery pictured.The original battery lasted nearly four years; hopefully, this one will give similar service; the only reason we are giving this four stars and not five is we cannot determine yet how long it will last and the price is more than we would have liked to pay.  Note however that Company A's price is about 25% less than the identical unit purchased from APC's website."
3030,"I have owned this camera for about a year, and the FZ15 for another year before that. I have taken thousands of pictures with them, so I can give you a good assessment of what you should expect. Since I've sold these, I upgraded to a Rebel XT, so I can also tell you how they compare.Interesting thing about the model is that, for various reasons, it has a very very loyal and almost cult-like following who make this camera sound like it's made by God himself. FZ20 is not ""all that"" as people here there and everywhere will tell you. It is just a very decent prosumer-grade camera.That said, I would recommend this over Canon S2IS (although comparable in image quality, feels like a toy over this one), and the Sony DSC-H1 (just not as polished enough as a serious camera). Yes, I have had a decent amount of experience using both of these other cameras.Many people will tell you that this camera can produce images so good that you won't be able tell the difference between it and one from a more expensive dSLR. This is only half-correct. Let me tell you that even with the mediocre kit-lens of the Canon Rebel XT (which you all know is the low-end model dSLR), you will be able to tell the difference when compared side-by-side. Better contrast, color balance, sharpness, just more lively and ""better-looking."" On the other hand, if you just show the picture from an FZ20 and tell them that it's from a Canon 5D, you can probably fool most people (including me). But then again, I am very confident that I can take a picture with my Canon A620 and do the same.I seem to be too much on the negative here, so let me compensate for my 4-stars. With good lighting, this camera can produce some very impressive images, and the zoom reach is just awesome. If you haven't had experience with ultra-zooms, you will appreciate how it opens up another world of opportunities in your composition. I would go out to the street, sit on a bench, start shooting away at people without them noticing me at all... resulting in people looking very natural, not looking into the camera and smiling.Let me close by noting a very very important difference between these two cameras. The FZ20 is a ""daylight"" camera. If you need to take pictures over ISO80 (on the FZ20), you WILL DEFINITELY be able to tell the difference between the image it produces and one a Rebel XT would produce under the same ISO. ISO400 shots on this camera is, I am sorry, HORRENDOUS. That's right. HORRENDOUS. You cannot use it. This means that if you use it in auto setting in a semi-dark place (even inside of a decently lit building), you will get a bad image. If you set the ISO low and lower the speed to compensate, you will get a blurred image - if not from your handshake (please, the IS is good, but it doesn't do magic), then from your subject moving. The Rebel XT, set your ISO up to 800, it's STILL better than the FZ20's ISO 200. In fact, the XT's ISO 1600 is comparable to FZ20's ISO 200. This means great pictures even when your not outside in the daytime.Hope you found this helpful :)"
3031,I Bought the monopod to help steady my camera when zoomed in.  Took it to Morro Bay to film the seals and otters playing in the ocean.  It was a real windy day so the monopod was not able to stabilize the camera much but it makes a dandy walking stick for hiking. Got a feeling it will do a good job if the wind is not too heavy

3033,"Forty years ago, speakers that got voices ""right"", so that it seemed you were at a live concert, not listening to a recording, cost $500 a pair, and up.  Ten years ago, the price for first rate speakers dropped to as little as $200 per pair.  The X-230 speakers get voices ""right"", for $50.Yes, the mid-bass is too heavy, and there is no DEEP bass.  But, these are tiny speakers, designed to be plugged into a laptop computer in a dorm room, not fill a large family room with floor shaking bass.I use them with my phone, which has a good EQ app that lets me smooth out the mid-range and upper bass.  In an average size bedroom, Cleo Laine sounds like Cleo Laine...$50 speakers connected to a $99 phone.After two years or so, they still are as good as new, even though I sometimes push the volume up past sensible.As of November 2012, the X-230 are not available ""new"".

3036,"For the past 7 years I've been using a grey 106"" Elite manual screen. It has been a great screen but since I'm watching more 3D, I needed to move to a white screen to give me more brightness in 3D mode.Enter the 106"" M106UWH Elite screen which I received yesterday. I have pulled down and retracted the screen several times and it seems fine and smooth. Pulling down is a bit tough however but I figure it will loosen up over time.The screen definitely curls on the sides. Not a big deal however when watching a movie. I threw up a cross hatch test pattern on the screen and focus was uniform all the way across the screen even with the curls on the sides.Light reflection and viewing angle are excellent. It's almost like I got a new projector. I had to actually decrease the light output from my projector because the picture was too bright (this is probably because I was coming from a grey screen however).The screen does not come with mounting hardware but DOES come with small metal rings on each end so the screen can be hung from hooks on the ceiling. Luckily my old screen and the M106UWH are the same length so I simply replaced the screen on the same ceiling hooks. Also note that the product dimensions listed on the description here on Company A are incorrect. The screen is not 92.4"" long. It's more like 98.5"". Visiting the Elite website will give you more accurate information regarding the dimensions of the screen.Overall, pretty pleased but took off one star for the curl on the sides of the screen. Shipping via Company A Prime took an extra day as the screen was apparently stuck in the warehouse."
3037,"The demo for the X-540 at the store was awesome enough for me to give it a try.  Compared to the $30 2.0 speaker set, the various 2.1 speakers, that weird strip thing containing 3 speakers, and the X-540, the X-540 sounded the strongest.  There was one more expensive set to the right.  Sound quality seemed equal.There were also 3 Bose sets to the left, but as they had their own music piped through, I summarily discounted them.  Didn't seem fair to include, somehow...So why give the X-540 a try?  The wired remote:  It's got the power button, volume adjustment, bass adjustment (a BIG plus), and ""matrix"" effect button that allows 2 speaker sources (CDs) to be pumped on all speakers...  Convenience is an understatement.  Never mind they sounded good at the store!So I whipped out Satan's plastic pal, paid the $100, and lugged it home.Set up was easy and all the cables were provided.  Always helpful, that...My sound card is a Creative Labs Fatal1ty Gamer.For reference point, I am replacing a three year old Logitech x-620 speaker set.To summarize the X-540:Good points:* The remote.  I like having every conceivable control at my finger tips and not on a computer screen or attached to the subwoofer on the floor.* Sound from CDs or 5.1 enabled games is fantastic.  The two speakers per module gets some of the credit here.* Turning down the bass on the remote doesn't hamper bass tones as badly as the x-620; or, rather, most of the tones can be heard without the wretched reverb shaking up the house like a blender.* The ""Matrix"" effect is quite acceptable.  Thumbs up from me.  It pipes the left/right sounds from the front to the rear systems, using a slight delay effect and others to make it sound ""real"" and encompassing.  Hard to describe, but while it simply can't take an existing stereo soundtrack and make it 5 separate channels (no sound system can), the trickery used to mimic the effect is very good indeed.* I had no problems with cable length for the rear speakers (6' away with plenty of slack cable remaining).  But YMMV; not all computer desks are the same.The not-so-good points:* With 'matrix' enabled, the bass setting needs to be increased slightly; decreased when disabled.The awful points:* For the price offered, why is the subwoofer unprotected?  Their preceding models have even a basic grille for the subwoofer.  The subwoofer is aimed directly toward the floor, but if you're renting, those neighbors are not going to be keen on listening to the heavy thumping!Definitely recommended.  8/10Keep in mind, I am not using these speakers above 50% (and at this level they sound very clear and crisp, even on older, digitally remastered CDs).  I like the ability to hear and I've got neighbors who like quiet too.  :)  At the store, I did crank the puppies up to 80% and heard none of the issues some other commentators have mentioned.  That's when I noticed people talking louder and thinking of me when I think of other people who crank the volume up to 100% to listen to speaker quality.So, that's my story."
3038,"Even these low-end Polk speakers blow away the competitors. I can't believe the volume these tiny speakers push through without any hint of distortion. Only complaint is the subwoofer is a little weak.Overall, my rating depends on how much you paid for these speakers. 3-star if you paid the MSRP of $500, 4-star if you bought them at Company A for $250, and 5-star if you bought them (like I did) at Fry's Outpost for only $199!"
3039,"Excellent IS based lens, but I have to question the value of the lens based on the other products available today.  With a very slow F4 aperture, one can easily find a better solution to line up a great lens set including fast primes.  Still, this lens is quite compact, has an exceptional focal range, and can easily serve its purpose on the APS-C sized sensor cameras."
3040,"I love this bag now that I finally got it. It has room for all my camera, lenses, and accessories! I would recommend this product. Only the product!"

Not cumbersome and much lighter than a hardcase, it's great for everyday use for people like me who like to have the camera on them at all times... just in case"
3042,I bought this a few months ago and have been happy with it. The quality of construction seems good and it is easy to adjust length quickly. It easily handles my Canon Rebel XSI even with a 70-200 f/2.8 lens which is quite heavy. I have not tried more expensive monopods and this one seems adequate for my needs. I plan to use it during school functions with the kids and for extra stability for non-IS lenses.
3043,"My mistake obviously, but I took some erroneous online advice to use it for my Canon EF 10-22 lens and it doesn't fit at all. Even if I monkeyed with it there's no way it would fit.I still gave it 4 stars because it's a nice quality piece. Minus 1 star because they weren't clear about the size of it."
3044,"I am very happy with these speakers.  However, I am beginning to wish I had bought the Monitor 60's instead.  I have an excellent subwoofer, and currently I do not have the Monitor 70's set to full band on my receiver.  I crossed them over to the sub because I prefer the sub handle the bass.  If this is how you are planning to set up your home theater then I would suggest getting the Monitor 60's instead.  If your fronts aren't going to be set to full band then there is no need for a 3-way speaker.  By getting the Monitor 60's you would save some money, and have one extra woofer handling the mids.  If you are not getting a subwoofer then I suggest the Monitor 70's, however, in order to get a lot of bass out of them they would need more power then a normal A/V receiver can supply.  If you get a stereo amp just for these, that would defeat the point of getting the monitor series of speakers as I consider this line a sort of bargain line in the home theater arena."
3045,"I got my 40Gb iPod Photo a couple of Christmases ago ... I know its a long time past and this review is very late in coming, but I thought, people can still buy this product on the ""used"" Ipod market, and I thought that here was a good place to give it its due...I use iTunes 6.X with it now, and it is still going strong on its original battery! I'm not at ""hard music user"", so I didn't run it through its courses as much as a ""power"" user may.I used it more as a PDA -- loving its calendar, using it as a hard drive -- and with only buying two other items for it (the Contour Design ""Showcase 4G"" case and the perpetually top-mounted Griffin iTalk) I was as happy as a clam.I enjoyed being able to view images on its 2-inch screen, but I loved being able to show my friends and family how a simple miniplug-to-RCA cable lets you scroll through your photos on your TV screen. If your creative, you can put visible maps on this thing... truly sweet!As I owned it for a while, its weight wore on me a bit, and I would have preferred something a little smaller and with a removable battery. The hard drive thing is a bit much, but that's a long time past. If I have now gone with a flash-based MP3 player with capabilities [FM Radio, built in USB-host capabilities, Line in jack]. If I didn't need these functions, I may have gone with the newer Nano line, but that's a different story...No regrets, it has (and in some cases, still does have) its place in my tech life. I'd still recommend it to anyone."

3048,"I've been a long time JP1 remote users which is very capable. But this remotes makes everything easy. The most impressive feature for me is the Media button. If you have CD Jukebox 300 disc changer, it works beautifully.The negative thing about this remote is the web based programming interface. It's not very intuitive and can be frustrating sometime.Another thing that I dont like about this remote is the directional arrows. It's a metal ring that's really hard to press and get it right. Sometimes when I try to press down, it goes left or right if I'm not being carefull."
3049,"I got tired of constantly having to redo the menus on my Pronto everytime I made a minor change, so when I saw this Harmony remote advertised, I thought it sounded like a really great and easier alternative. I don't have a Media PC but I really liked the choice of buttons on it, so thought I'd give it a try. Let's cover the highs and lows:1. Good remote for Tivo use (probably best of the Harmonies), but I had to manually configure a lot of the buttons that really should have been preset. Like play, pause, forward, etc. None of those worked with the basic setup.2. Basic setup is easy, but the online help if you have any problems is really confusing and annoying at times. I never did find anything that described how to use the online program guide. I did figure it out myself, but there should be more help for stuff like this.3. As another user mentioned, ability to customize is somewhat limited, certainly compared to some other fancier (but more expensive) universal remotes. For instance, the macros for doing things like Listen to Music only determine what components will be on and what inputs they will be set to. I cannot, for instance, make Listen to Music tune my cable box to my favorite digital music channel. The up-side of this is that for most people, the setup is pretty easy, you don't have to be a techno-geek to figure it out, like you do with some remotes.4. The ability of the remote to remember what components are on and off and switch them automatically is *really* nice. The Help button to correct any issues always worked great for me if something got messed up accidentally.5. I'm glad I can add some custom commands using the LCD but the biggest issue for me here is that it only allows 5 characters to display. Definitely NOT enough.Overall, this is a decent remote that does what you want 95% of the time. For a lot of users that find programming universal remotes too difficult, it's a great solution. I'm not sure it's quite the right remote if you really want complete control, but for the most part, it does the job."
3050,"I was looking for a pair of noise canceling headphones, preferably from a company I know and trust to make quality products. After much research I found these Sony headphones. For the price, i think they do exactly what they are supposed to. Don't get tricked by the ""noise canceling"" feature though. This means that it gets rid of low pitched noises like plane engines or air conditioners. They don't cancel out people talking or high pitched movie sounds. Of course, if your looking for amazing quality, deep bass, or anything along these lines, you should buy Bose headphones or something more expensive. When it comes to headphones the more money you spend the better quality, so don't be mad that these ~$40 headphones don't work the way you imagined."
3051,"The build quality of these cases are superb, and it allows those who need their hands on physical media a great way to protect their investment.  While I mostly purchase digital goods, this was a preferred option for my girlfriend.  My only gripe is the lack of expand-ability, and in the future I'll purchase the version that has the 3-ring binder setup."
3052,"This is a nice drive.  It went in without any hitches.  I used Ghost v8 to restore my previous drive image to it.I previously used another Maxtor, an Ultra ATA/133 80GB 7200rpm drive with 2MB cache, so this drive is very similiar except for the much larger (16MB) cache -- but it's enough to make a noticeable improvement in speed!  My last one lasted about five years (and was still working fine, just needed more space) so hopefully this one will last as well.The drive is very silent -- well, when it's just spinning but not being used.  When it's actively being used, it's still got that classic Maxtor crunching sound, just like my old Maxtor.  Not obnoxiously loud, but you can clearly hear that it's working.  If you're looking for a drive you can't hear, this is not the one.  Hence, four stars only.  However, other than that, I highly recommend it."
3053,"SD200 is the latest Elph from Canon. It is slimmer and loaded with more features than ever before.Pro's,1. Good picture quality for a super-compact camera.2. Priced right.3. Excellent feature set.4. Large LCD screen.5. Cool metallic body.6. Excellent package including a smart world charger.7. Uses industry standard SD cards, not propreitary memory sticks or xD.8. 3MP and 3x zoom is the right combination for most people. Any more MP would a waste of money.9. Intuitive interface and solid build quality.Con's,1. No manual controls yet on Elph.2. Awkward to hold compared to older Elph's (No place put your right thumb when taking pics).3. Battery life is below average.4. Another costly & propreitary battery from Canon.Its hard to get very exicted about the latest Elph if you already own one, there isn't much new. However if you are looking for your first, the SD200 is an excellent choice."
3054,I plug this little baby into my computer and it recognizes the unit instantly. I did not have to use the cd that it comes with. I am running windows 2000. No problem encountered so far. The greatest thing about this product is that you can tranfer information directly from one drive to the next without copying to your hard drive. Very handy little gadget.
3055,Good card but not the fastest now at the market. Using it for more than 3 years without any problem
3056,"This product is exactly what I hoped for, no more, no less.  Solid plain cardboard CD holder/mailer.  It's not going to withstand someone trying to break it, but it is plenty tough enough to withstand dropping or things set on top of it."
3057,"I like to have small cameras and cell phones on a strap like this.  I have always used Canon's Metal Neck Strap, also found at Company A.  What I like about this one is that I can unclip the item without removing the strap from my neck.  I generally use a neck strap while doing things like Kayaking where I can just pull the camera out of my vest and shoot one handed and then stuff it back into the vest.  An advantage with small cameras like the Canon Elph Class point and shoot cameras is the fact that you have this nice HANDLE to assist you when shooting.  Recently shooting hummingbirds I held the camera with my right hand and held the end of the neck strap in my left hand.  As I extended ther camera outward I held back on the neck strap tightly.  The camera stayed so rock solid the shots were fabulous.  Cloth doesn't last as long as the metal Canon strap so that is why there are 4 stars here.  Otherwise item works well. Robert"
3058,"PodWave Portable iPod Stereo Speaker - ReviewJohn NemerovskiColumnist, The Nemo Memo, Book BytesWednesday, 04/27/05Introduction, by Barbara ""Mrs. Nemo""Every summer we drive to California in our VW New Beetle. John and I stuff in our clothes and cooler, maps and hiking boots with no room to spare, except for his computer and music tapes and CDs and a boom box to play them on.The boom box is an important summer accessory because it lulls us to sleep each night. I hear five minutes or less of Mozart and I am out cold. (Or is it the fog, or perhaps the great food and too much wine?) But I resent the space that ugly boombox takes up in our tiny car.Packing for the trip has a new challenge this year. We are bringing our puppy, a six pound Havanese, with all her paraphernalia, a crate, some blankets, toys, food, and doggie bowls. Where shall we squeeze in the computer and boom box around a dog?John has solved our musical problem with the recent acquisition of an iPod and PodWave. It's a little speaker that fits on top of the iPod and will play lullabies for us each night. Sweet dreams for us, and less arguing about where the hiking boots fit in and does he really need four Photoshop books and backpacks full (...).Thank you, iPod and PodWave. You have saved our marriage and family for another year. But we are mailing our clothes to California because puppy needs space in the VW.(...)Prior to PodWave's arrival, my super duper 30GB iPod (3rd generation) was deficient in one important category. Without a built-in speaker, there was no way to listen to any music on the iPod without earphones or a car adapter.Remove PodWave (PW) from its plastic package, place the included throwaway AA battery into a compartment within PW's cylindrical plastic case, insert PW into audio port on top of iPod, move a single small black switch from off to on position (a LED indicator would be helpful), turn up iPod volume to high, and listen out in the open (preferably indoors). That's it!(...)This device is simply great, meaning it's v-e-r-y easy to use and ideal for casual (non-audiophile quality) listening.Sound quality is decent, given PW's small size and tiny speakers. Midtones are clear and crisp, and high frequencies are acceptable. Bass is somewhere between inaudible and nonexistent, but who cares? Distortion is minimal, and pop music sounds fine, as does most jazz and classical.You'll soon learn to become creative with placement of iPod+PodWave for optimum audio, because the sound is not very loud. So far my first choice is with the duo resting on a resonant wood surface, such as a dresser, with my neoprene iPod case placed in an inverted V above the speaker, sort of like a roof over a house, when observed from the front. Here's a photo:I recommend you use rechargeable AA's instead of single-use batteries, for environmental reasons, if not for longer audio time. Your mileage will vary; I get a LOT of playing from a single rechargeable!If audiophiles give me grief due to PW's ""tinny"" sound, they can take a long one-way hike with their $500 earbuds up the nearest peak. Because in real world usage, I intend to keep PodWave close at hand for listening around the house. It's cute, affordable, convenient, reasonably sonorous, and it works! If you need ambient audio (mostly indoors, as opposed to outside or in the car), get one today."
3059,"I purchased this 1101 after my original unit after 5 years took a water nap never to return.  For receiving distant FM signals and clear AM reception this radio is excellent.  Shortwave is also good but as this is a simple radio there are ones out there that can do this better.  I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for a quality control issue.  When the radio arrived I took the radio out of the box and I found that the screw that tightens the antenna into place had fallen out and was in the box.  When I took a closer look at the rest of the radio I found that 2 of the other screws that hold the radio together were also loose.  For the QC Pass sticker to be on the unit this makes no sense to me at all.  As this radio has been discontinued I am just happy that my issue was fixable with a screw driver and hope I am good for another 5 years.Update September 2011Since my original review I have had no issues and the radio has performed excellently.  I'm just glad that my issues were fixed by tightening a few screws as this radio is amazing.Update December 2011Just got back from a trip where I took Greyhound from CA to FL, Then I went from FL to WI, and finally from WI back to CA.  This is my second trip cross country and the radio performed excellently.  In several places my Kaito was the only radio able to pick up anything.Update March 2013The radio has been on 3 more cross country trips and is still working like a champ."
3060,"The fans are working ok, but if I had to make one complaint, it's the screws / or more correctly, the screw holes.  It was a tight fit and I had to use a fair amount of force to get the screw to go thru the hole.  I shouldn't have to apply that much force on delicate computer components.  I bought 4 of these fans and all four had the same issue.  But once mounted, working ok."
3061,"I use this remote control throughout my house with my current Mythbuntu setup.  Well, I did add a Linux sticker to it.  :)The only way it would be better is if MythTV had setup all of the buttons correctly.  But, I'm pretty sure that the software will allow the programming of buttons.  And the buttons that do work are all of the commands that I need."
3062,"I use the Dish Network ViP 622 HDTV receiver.Picture Quality:Cannot imagine betterSize:Wish it was bigger. I had to fit the TV into my Armoir cabinet, so size was my contraint. If Sony would have put the speakers on the top/bottom instead of the sides, and made 38"" size, I could have fit it.Weight:235 pounds is a bear, but I used 5 people for the lift into the cabinet, and none of the 5 was strong at all. It was a breeze.Just be smart about how you move and lift it and you will be fine.How I use the TV:--The Zoom, Horizontal Expand, Vertical Expand, and Full modes are great. I usually flip to Full for HDTV, and Vertical Expand when watching SDTV. Sometimes, Zoom is great for certain HDTV if you want to the some wildlife up close.--Vivid preset. I keep the Vivid preset on at all times. The other modes do not seem to have the light output that I need.--I watch mostly 4:3, so a 4:3 is best for me. When I watch widescreen, though, it is like owning a 34"" Sony widescreen. I think you better off with the 36"" 4:3 until more channels go HDTV.The picture is awesome, you will not regret this purchase.Wish List: Make me a 38"", move the speakers to the top, and lower the weight a little.UPDATE after 2 years: The TV still works flawlessly. Here are some additional notes, though:1. CON - Only one HDMI input. This was not an issue at first, but now I have an HD Dish Network Receiver and a Blue Ray Player. I bought a ""Terk HDMI-31 Smart HDMI Switch (3 X 1)"" to resolve the issue.2. PRO - Works great with the Dish Network HD DVR Receiver and the LG BD300 Blue Ray Player with Netflix.3. PRO - The ability to switch between the different screen types, such as ""full, zoom, horizontal, and vertical"" is easy and works very well. I use this remote button frequently."
3063,"This is the first FM Transmitter I ever purchased for myself. It works well and its great that it can select a wide range of stations for transmission. Additionally, one thing I noticed is to get the best sound quality, make sure not to have the volume on your mp3 player all the way to the max. I have mine set to about 75% of its highest level and let the car take care of the overall volume from there. Reason for this is and pops or static or interference, or roughness within the mp3 file itself is greatly exaggerated if you turn the volume to the max on your mp3 player and  transmit it. On my Insignia Pilot MP3 Player, I had it at Volume Level 30 out of 40. and it sounded perfect. The iRiver AFT 100 is a reliable transmitter, and in the NYC and outer suburbs area 89.9 is the best station to transmit on."
3064,incredible mids / nice response range.  tweeters are ok for highs (not like horns on my vintage altec model 19)  12&#34; or higher sub will complaint 4 of these speakers including a quality center channel.  Cons needs gasket material around plastic and ceiling contact.  No low sharp bass response need subwoofer. Free air or cabinets seems to have little to no effect ( mostly due to mid range).  Buy a quality center channel speaker and a larger subwoofer to pick up the weak points in these speakers.
3065,"Note these headphones have an open ear design(they will leak sound).These headphones arrived before their destined date.  At first I felt somewhat skeptical about them.  The wire seem low quality and the plastic cap at the top sides of the headphones come off easily.  The sound quality seem mediocre, but after about a week I start to realize how clear and crisp the sounds they reproduced were.  The isolation of the bass and treble are great, so you don't get that muddy sound you would from cheaper products.  Although the cable seems flimsy toward the top of the headphones, I've seen Mods where people replace the cable with a higher quality one.  While the ear cushions are extremely soft and comfortable, the headphones tend to squeeze onto your earlobes after long use(Simply adjusting the headband will solve this).  Overall the headphone is awesome(can be better with slight modifications)."
3066,"Iv'e had this pair since 2011 and the sound was consistently amazing since then. The biggest issue over time is the connecting wires to each headphone, as well as to the jack. They wear down eventually, and eventually come out, even when exclusively used on a  desktop- not in transit or exercising. I would recommend them but they wont last forever."
3067,"My collection of radios continues to grow, and the E100 is the most recent addition.  I bought it because there's a lot of features built into such a small package.This radio will easily fit into a pocket or briefcase, yet it allows you to access AM, FM and pretty much the full range of shortwave bands.  It has a clock with alarm, snooze feature, 200 presets (although I can't imagine ever using more than 50), battery strength indicator, signal strength indicator, and more.The AM (MW) band pulls in stations well using the internal ferrite rod antenna.  The telescoping whip works well for both FM and SW, but I sometimes attach one of those 23' portable wire antennas to more clearly pull in weaker SW stations.Battery life (2 AA's) seems to be very good, and the internal speaker puts out clear sound, although as you can imagine it isn't going to be room-filling.  The earbuds work very well.At about 100 bucks street price, it ain't cheap, but when you pick it up it looks and feels like quality work."
3068,Nice cable. Works Fine. Connector is a little bulky. Take that into account if you don't have enough room for cables in the back of your appliances.
3069,"I paired this up with some TakStar hifi 2050 dedicated headphones.  I would recommend pairing them up with nicer headphones though.  I have burned them in for many hours now.  Easily over 100.  I have noticed that the virtual surround sound that the sabrent provides is now noticeable.  In counter-strike for example, i can pin point people through walls just by hearing their footsteps and then prefire them before they come out.  It works great for HD audio files too.  The sabrent has its own mixer and effects software as well as speaker location with a sub in the virtual surround sound section.  It also has a built in voice morpher, which I haven't been able to get working yet.  I've just been plugging my mic into the onboard jack of my mobo.  The worst issue I had was that the software manager always crashed any time I played the game Dragon Nest.  I am guessing this is because of the anti-cheat program that goes along with games like that.  I gave it 4 because I couldn't get a few things to work, but it is overall a steal at under $20 by far.P.S.  The cd that came with it was bent beyond repair, but you never use those anyways.  Always download latest drivers for anything online."
3070,"I needed to place some .iso files as I was assisting a local mentoring program. No issues so far with using these, and the write pretty quickly. I have not had to rewrite on any of them yet, but will update if I have any problems with that."
3071,"A few things to note:1.  This is only for desktop use.  The unit is essentially a vented aluminum tray with fans attached to the bottom.  It is not enclosed underneath, so you will interfere with it if you set it on your lap.2.  It's not super-sturdy.  I could see how excessive movement could cause wires to come loose or fans to get jammed.Again, I think the important point is that it is intended for stationary, desktop use.That said, it does have its good points:1.  It moves a *surprising* amount of air.  And it's really quiet while it does.2.  The on/off switch is handy.  Not completely necessary, but handy.3.  The tilted design is convenient for typing on.One minor complaint, it takes up a USB port and doesn't give it back.  There is no USB hub in the unit, so the USB port you lose powering the fan is gone.Overall, good product, does what it's supposed to."
3072,I only got to use these for about 2 weeks before my cat ate them.... but while I had them I liked them.  Overall good sound quality.  Much better than the overpriced apple crap.
3073,"Has been great, so far. It hasn't been used much yet. I charged all the batteries I had when I first received it in early December. I used the batteries in my digital camera and the battery life has been tremendous compared to alkaline batteries. I got a havoc heli for Christmas. I put 6 of the rechargeables in it. It's Jan 13th and I still have not had to recharge them. The batteries have been used for 3 heli charges and the ensuing flight each day since Christmas. I might rate the kit 5 stars, but I don't have enough info to go by. I haven't attempted any of the advanced settings. While, I won't say it's difficult to use, it is far from intuitive. The 2700mah batteries seem to last forever when charged at the 200mah rate. On the lowest charge level, it took about 8 hours to charge 4 brand new AA batteries. I think the AAAs took about 5 hours."
3074,"It works out of the box with linux, three button mouse with scroll wheel is good. The A/V remote control function works but will not replace a universal remote:Only limited device support: my sony receiver is not supportedNo direct channel number input, no video selectionOnly F1-F12 can be programmed for A/V"
3075,"I used this to replace my factory radio in my 2000 Ranger.  Using the enclosed directions I don't think it took 20 minutes to assemble and install this trim kit into the truck and the radio in the trim kit.  It looks fine and gives me a place to put my phone when I am driving.  I suppose the finish could be a bit better, thus the four stars, but for the price this is an excellent value.  It installed easily and looks fine, I would recommend this to a friend."
3076,"BREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.Is this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.This dock basically serves three purposes:- The traditional synch & charge function available since the early days.- It helps you get ""Line"" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends & family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the ""Apple iPod AV Cable"" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.In summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box."
3077,"The product itself does what it should not pretty cables,  hey just look cheap like regular speaker wire with plugs on the ends,  but they do work well"
3078,"For the very small additional cost compared the the almost identical 320, this provides nationwide coverage built in.  There are some small quibbles about the maps.  I live on a small street, and the Street Pilot doesn't know it exists... but of course I do, and I don't need this unit to find my way home.  Second quibble is that the audio goes from loud to almost inaudible in three of the ten steps.  I'd like to be able to set it at medium vollume, but it seems to be either LOUD or inaudible.  Third, some rural addresses don't register easily.  I recently wanted to go to a wedding at a farm, and the unit didn't recognize any version of the address I was given, until I decided to use HWY as an abbreviation, and then suddenly my destination actually WAS available.  So you might need to be ""creative"" with some addresses.  You CAN locate a town and then navigate the screen to where you believe your destination is, and lock that spot in.  That's how I disovered that HWY was the key part of the address I wanted. Last quibble, the face is very reflective, and in daylight can be essentially unreadable depending on the sun.  I've tried various angles and so on, and nothing works well to reduce the glare factor.  Maybe some sort of anti-glare surface, even a removable film or something like that would be cool.  POSITIVES are that aside from a few mapping quirks, it will always get you to where you want to go.  VERY nice feature is the ability to set ""home.""  If you are like me and like to wander back roads or whatever, you can set your motel as ""home"" and wander as much as you like, and you can then hit ""go home"" and it will take you back to the motel.  To me, that's worth the price of the unit.I recently had to go to a place in a city 50 miles away.  The Street Pilot took me there precisely the way I would have chosen on my own, being familiar with the route.  It didn't like that on the return trip, I chose to avoid some major road construction by taking a back road.... but once it recognized that it couldn't logically get me back on the ""preferred"" route, it actually took me the way us ""locals"" would go.So all in all, it probably isn't going to take you your favorite way through your neighborhood.... but it WILL get you where you want to go,  It gives you the choice between ""fastest"" and ""shortest"" route, but even so, it seems to ignore some routes as being shorter than others.  I.e., here in my town, you can choose a route with two hospitals and three schools and MANY traffic lights... as opposed to a route with two traffic lights and none of the other traffic congesting issues.  The Street Pilot will choose the congested route, either on ""shortest"" or ""fastest"" setting.  So It is clear that locals know better..... but it is also clear that Street Pilot will get you where you want to go.  I think everyone tests out the Street Pilot on local runs.  I know I did.  But the fact is that while local knowledge can trump this device, there's no way around the fact that it will ALWAYS get you to where you want to go.Six months later: I have no revisions to the above, but I really was amazed that Garmin was $70 for its 2008 map upgrade!!  One third the cost of the unit!!!  This is REALLY ridiculously priced and I know I'm not going to fall for that crap.  So maybe they've updated some stuff and added new developments.  It ain't worth one third the cost of the whole setup.  I'm downgrading my rating by a star just for this idiocy."
3079,"This antenna works great for me--it picked many more channels (connected to an EyeTV USB tuner) than my other digital antenna (connected to a TV).My gripe is with the base, because its design makes it unsteady even on a flat surface. The coaxial cord comes out from the center of the bottom of the device, and is supposed to snake through a short channel and either out the back or front. The problem is the cable is too thick and stiff for this, the channel cannot ""hang on"" to it well, and the device itself isn't heavy enough to hold it down, so it's constantly popping out--I cannot get it to sit flush on a table or shelf and the rear rubber foot is actually not touching the surface. I've had it fall over a few times.Since the coaxial cable can't be unplugged from the base, I can't see much reason for this design--because really, how many people are going to want the choice of snaking the cable out the front instead of the back and have it hanging there in plain view?Since it works so well (and I've tried many antennas that simply didn't work in my area) I'm happy with it but I'm going to have to use tape or something to get it to sit truly flat.The flaw in the base design is why I couldn't give this product 5 stars."
3080,"After reading the reviews here, I am not sure if this antenna will do his job.  It finally arrived yesterday and I can tell it works good in my area.  I am living in San Mateo area CA near SFO, my TV scanned around 18 digital channels with it. All the major local channels FOX, ABC, CBS and NBC are received as HD without too much adjustment of the antenna. Other digital (non HD) channels are good too. Seems like the antenna gets more channels than my limited basic cable .I am happy with this product, the only down side is it seems to large to place it next to my 27 LCD TV."
3081,"These are nice, cheapy headphones.  Light on my head, they don't make me sweat, and easily adjustable.  I use mine for medical transcription, so the sound is perfectly adequate, although I have gotten a few spots where higher-pitched tones hurt my ears, but the sound is much clearer than what I get out of my computer speakers, so this is inconsequential. Another important feature for me is the extra-long cord.  At 11 feet, I can move about with relative freedom, turning to retrieve books from any direction without inadvertently yanking them off my head by accident.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with what my $18 bought."
3082,Cheep feeling but works great. I have had 2 for over a year. I could not live without my x10 set up. I also use my Harmony 1100.
3083,My first webcam.  Easy to set up and easy to use.  Decent quality but then have nothing to compare to.  Good clear sound.  Reasonable price.  All in all a good buy.
3084,"This is for RS120 and RS130 - and I eventually bought the RS130.I work for a computer company and bought this for my cube. A key characteristic is lots of RF noise - nearly every adjacent cube has a laptop and a deskside (or two if doubled up).Essentially all reviews were for home use. I was fortunate to borrow an RS-120 and an RS-130 at work - same floor even) I used the RS-120 for half hour and the RS-130 all day.From overall performance, I found RS-120 and RS-130 comparable as far as susceptibility to interference. I preferred the around the ear of the RS-130 over the RS-120 and my colleage with the RS-120 indicated his ears need a break from the RS-120 after several hours.The surround sound and auto tuning of the RS-130 were plusses but I bought the RS-130 mostly for the around the ear comfort and fit.Overall I really like these - but I do have some comments - and those tie back to other comments - ""the hiss in the background"".Some posters commented on ""the hiss in the background"". My RS-130s (and the one I borrowed) had this - but as Bruce Campbell said ""it's a trick - get an axe"".OK, they're not tricking you - but there is a workaround.The hiss seems to come from their on-headphone amplifier. You can make that go away by1) setting the on-headphone volume very low. Essentially dial it down until the hiss just goes away. Or a little more if you want to adjust volume more from headphone than computer.2) Crank up the drive to the base unit. I've got my computer Wave and Volume controls set very much higher than I used with my corded headphones. And now I get great volume out of the headphones. And I get it without any perceptible clipping or degradation.The bottom line - the base unit likes and is fine with driving it relatively hard - and by doing that not using much of the headset amp you sill not have a hiss problem.My last point is interference. In this very noise (ambient RF) environment at work I occasionally have a ""pfft"" as I turn my head or move about. Occasionally. Even with base 3 feet away. But so far, I've found no headset better and these are otherwise really sweet. [I otherwise can't say how these do with 900mhz phones]Overall - 4 stars and in particular prime for office use."
3085,"I got this for my partner who was using a clunky old cassette walkman on his daily power walks - hard to fit in the pocket of gym shorts and a pain to have to carry.  This works fine; the fidelity of the earphones could be better, but that's a problem I've found with all earbud type devices.  Good price, good performance, and you don't have to be an engineer to program it."
3086,"I bought this player in January,I read all the reviews, and thought I'd go for it.There was allot of NEG reviews on this player. but for theprice *and free shipping, It was worth the chance.Well It's been 4 months now, The player see's about 4 moviesa week on it.  No odd sounds, no broken up video, no misreadingof the dvds as DVR's or anything else.  The Unit is running great!With no hang up's at all.The only odd thing about this players I found was,The remote shown is not the remote you get.The one you get is very small, and it takes a bit to get use to.But other than that it works fine..I'll update, as the months pass.."
3087,"You can rely on Memorex products. They will never fail you. I have been using Memorex CDs and DVDs for years now. Writing DVDs have never been so easy and comfortable. My files, video and music are safe with Memorex products. I will recommend it to anybody without any reservation."
3088,"I bought this computer about a month ago and the aesthetics are nice (all the visual features look nice), it starts and shuts down fairly quikly. The only thing that i noticed is that it is kinda sluggish, i bought the 2gb ram for it and i guess it helped a little bit, the internet is where i can complain more about, it is somewhat slow/sluggish, not sure how else can i get this to go faster (sometimes i'm typing in the search box and there's no text.. im typing and typing and nothing). does anyone have any issues with this? other than everything else seems good, i also bought an external dvd rw drive so that i'm able to do the backup system procedure (also so that i have disc player/burner). thats about it! overall nice but have complains on the internet and how it handles (sluggish)."
3089,"I jus got these and so far, so good. The cable connection for these is generous and has a nice clip to keep it out of the way. The default is LOUD, so watch it when you first plug them in.Have used them while playing City of Heroes online and they sound great. I hear things going on behind and around my character that are in the distance or right next to me. For the price, these are terrific and I am very glad I bought them.The cord is about 8' long. This is fine for PC gaming, but not sure if it would be long enough for XBoxes and the like."
3090,"I really wanted to replace the plastic 50mm 1.8 with something a little faster with a wider focal length. I own a 50d and found that the 30mm focal length was just about perfect for taking indoor pictures of my 1 year old. I struggled for a long time over getting this lens or going for broke and getting the Canon 35mm 1.4. I've read tons of reviews, test charts, and compared direct images from both lenses. From what I found the two lenses are more similar than they are different and the only thing keeping me from getting the Sigma 30mm was all of the focusing issues I kept reading about. Finally I decided to get the lens, here are my thoughts about it below.Pros:- Very nice build quality- Fast, quiet focusing- Manual Focus override- $1000 cheaper than the Canon 35 1.4- Sharp in the center at 1.4 and decent in the corners, super sharp from corner to corner by 2.8.- 1.4 at 30mm on a crop is so great. I can take pictures indoors without a flash.Cons:- All of the focusing comments about this lens are completely true. The copy I got of this lens front focused like crazy. I took around 1000 pics with it and about 50 were in focus. After dialing in +13 micro focus compensation on my 50d this lens focuses perfectly.- This is a very minor complaint but the manual focusing ring is pretty stiff. I've gotten used to it but it's much stiffer than the 70-200 f4 Canon I own.- Another minor complaint for the pixel peepers out there. This lens has quite a bit of purple fringing at 1.4 if you're looking at your pics at 100% detail.- Minimum focus distance is 15.7 inches, a little longer than the Canon 35 1.4 which focuses at 12 inches.Summary:I really like this lens but I wouldn't buy it unless I had a camera with the ability to micro adjust. If you've got a 50d or higher than it's probably a safe buy. Once I adjusted the focus on my camera I can honestly say that the pictures that come out of this lens are truly special. Even wide open at 1.4, the pictures of my son are sharp with great colors and contrast. If you own a camera that doesn't have micro focus capabilities than you better be a patient person that's willing to trade out 3 or 4 lenses to get one that focuses properly."
3091,"I got this lens about 1 month ago and I really like it. It is pretty soft at f/1.4, but does get much sharper from f/1.8 on which makes it still very useful in low light. I have not had any focus issues with my copy and it focuses accurately at any distance. I do wish it focused closer than 15.5 inches though. I do think that Sigma has some significant quality control issues though as I reported in my review of their 70mm f/2.8 macro I recently bought. I go the macro after this lens because I was happy with it. When I brought my macro lens to the service center, who also services Canon, Nikon and Tamron lenses and they told me that they get more Sigma by far than any other brand with service issues even with brand new lenses."
3092,This bazooka tube fit my needs. I wanted a small package that packed a punch. The dual voice coil allowed me to hook this speaker in parallel with my amp. This 8 inch speaker fills my car with clean bass that adds to my music but doesn't dominate it.
3093,"Just got the E4s, after I accidentally cut the cord on my E3 (long story).  The E4s are a definite improvement: tighter sound, good low, mid, and high ranges. I listen to a lot of Jazz, and cymbals and high hats are crisper.  I find that I have to turn up the volume a bit more on my iPod using the E4s, but the improved sound quality is evident.  I was happy with the E3, but happier with the E4."
3094,"I have an average size head.  These headphones keep slipping off--they will not adjust for a snugger fit.  Sound quality is great, but the darn things don't block ambient noise because they are too loose.  Given the price, I expected a more adjustable fit from headphones, given the hype."
3095,"I've a question for the manufacturer - what is the driver size?  sounds like 40 mm.The headphones sound good out of the box and I I'm sure they will sound better after the 100 hour 'burn-in"".All plastic construction but I guess that is reason these great headphones have such a low price."
3096,"I've had a lot of wireless headphones over the years. Back in the 90's I tried some 900 MHz headphones, and they were prone to constant interference. Then in the early 2000's I had some Sony DS-5000 infrared headphones. They were decent, but had a serious lack of bass. Around 2003 I upgraded to the Sony DS-8000 infrared headphones, and those things were amazing. They had good bass, no hiss, optical inputs, and all sorts of cool features. Unfortunately they cost about $700, very few people bought them, and Sony stopped making them. Now my DS-8000 headphones have died, and I decided to look for some suitable replacements.First I tried the new Sennheiser RS-180 with KLEER audio. They sounded good, were comfortable, and had many other good attributes. However, they cut the speed of my wireless Internet connection in half. They used the same wireless frequency as my router, and even though KLEER audio was supposed to hunt for an open frequency, it slowed down the Internet greatly. That was a deal breaker and I returned the headphones.Then I tried the Sony DS-3000 infrared headphones. They had many good attributes as well, but were plagued by a constant background hiss. It wasn't just a minor hiss either. It was enough to completely ruin the listening experience. I returned them shortly after buying them.Finally, I purchased the Pioneer SE-DIR800C headphones, and I'm very happy with them. They are comfortable, light, attractive, easy to use, sound very good, don't have hiss, don't interfere with my Internet connection, and the bass is decent (but not great). The Sony DS-8000 is still my favorite, but hey they don't make that anymore, so I need to move on and let go. I believe the Pioneer SE-DIR800C is the best wireless headphone system you can buy at the moment, and this is coming from someone who has owned 7 wireless headphones over the years. I would definitely recommend these.I think these headphones deserve 4 stars. Why not 5 stars? Well, they need a bit more bass, and I think they sound a tad bright. They would get 5 stars if improvements were made to those areas. In spite of those shortcomings, I'm quite happy with these headphones, and plan on keeping them for several years."
3097,Pros:* Light* very thin and flexible cod* simple designCons:* the scroll ball gets dirty too easily
3098,"This is a very compact, yet very usable mouse.  It's a good size for travel.  It only gets four stars, though, because an earlier model would work when plugged into a usb hub, but this one must be plugged directly into my laptop in order for it to function."
3099,"I bought this fan to connect to my TiVo in the media closet, which tends to run a little hot since it's enclosed. It's working great and doing the job with a minimum of noise. I like the retractable USB cable and the variable speed dial. Now it just remains to be seen how long it will function running 24/7."
3100,"This is a good player, really it is, it does everything it says but theres cons to it.CONS:*There's a siginifcant break in between songs*If youre watching a video you cant go to the next video without going back to the main menu*Fastforwarding and Rewinding sucks*The sound dosent go very high, with and without headphones*Battery life is only about 2 and a half hours when watching video and listening to music with the screen on*and one HUGE road block, you cant just drag and drop videos they need to be in ASF format, most video converters dont do asf and the converter Mustek gives you does not convert big video files, I called them and they confirmed this but they promised to send me a new converter in 10 days.PROS:*40gigs on something that can fit into your pocket is beautiful*The video quality on it is very good and the screen size is NICE*It's PVR capabilities are amazing, you can even set it to record at a certain time like a vcr."
3101,Brand name (starts with a D) costs twice as much as these 3v batteries. So i got two packs. They seem to work just as well as the brand name batteries and last just about as long. No big noticeable difference. Satisfied with the batteries.I was concerned these were PhotoLithium since I'm using them in a LED/Xenon flashlight but they seem to work just fine.
3102,Sound good and all weather perfect for out by our pool. have them hooked up through a wireless system to our Onkyo TXSR608 and they sound great.
3103,"I bought this remote to replace an older one made by the same company and sold under the Radio Shack brand.  I liked the old remote and was happy to discover that this unit works very similar.Pros:Large Code Library, I found codes for all of the devices I needed to control, new and old.  Easy to program, works like my old remote, so no learning curve.  Learning capability. I am glad it has this, but I didn't need it because all the function of my old remotes are already covered.  Macros for automating multiple button presses. Code numbers are the same as on older One For All remotes.  JP 1.2 interface for serious remote customization.Cons:No Backllight.  I miss having a backlight, but I can live without it.  Not all codes listed in the manual.  One or two devices I had to look up in the manual for my old remote because they were not in the manual for this unit, even though the remote supports them.  Manual missing important information about how to use some codes.  I had to read online to figure out how to program the Home Automation codes to a device.  I don't care for the layout, especially the ""vcr"" keys like play pause ff/rew.  All the other remotes I have these are on the bottom, but this unit has them on top.  I think I prefer the other placement.  No indication of selected mode.  Not a big deal, but it is nice for the remote to show you what mode is selected so you don't have to select the mode every time you want to do something."
3104,"I bought this for my Sony Cybershot DSC-S600 6MP Digital Camera and it's too small -- my camera fits in the case fine but the flap just barely reaches the top edge of the Velcro strip when you bend it over the top of the camera.  It's very well made, just too small."
3105,"Right after getting it and going for the first test drive, I pulled out of my neighborhood and the Ka starts going off. I don't see any police cars. Great, false alarms. As I approach the blind intersection 1/4 mile away, a police car rolls up to the light going from right to left. So this detected the radar signals from a 90 degrees. What a way to start. The rest of my 50 mile test drive went well, detecting radar and picking up a limited amount of store X and K bands. I even got one POP alert. Its a jungle out there.There are a nice number of programmable settings. Its easy to program. I may shut off the X band detection. We don't use the SWS alerts where I live and I didn't like the auto volume adjustment so I turned that off. Read the manual, there are other options. The one thing I don't like is you can't completely turn off the display. You can select ""dark"" and wont get display alerts however I can still see the red ""AD"" on the display from the outside through my tinted back window.04/22/13 Update - It's odd but sometimes this thing just starts going crazy for what appears to be no reason. After turning it off and back on or I move to another area it seems to quit and wont happen again for awhile. I really do not know if that's normal or not. Im talking about random POP alerts going off a couple seconds apart, laser going off, other bands all  happening close together quickly a few seconds apart."
3106,"I have not tried this drive yet i am still waiting for it so iw ill update this in a few days i jsut wanted to let people know that when a drive says 320 gig or what ever the size it is not 320 gig.  That is a marketing ploy because the way the metric system is.  The actuall drive is smaller because that is how the computer reads it. no matter what drive u buy (external, internal) and no matter what brand you buy it is the same i have looking into this completly and asked my professors about it at virgina tech. so dont worry about that but if it is anyhting like the other two internal wd drives i have it is going to be awsome"
3107,"Pluses - The deciding factor for me to get this was the AA battery .. my Panasonic with it's AAA using rechargable batteries lasts about 45 minutes .. so I really like the AA .. not sure why more mp3's dont use it.  Another plus my XP computer loaded the mp3 players as a drive and I could drop and drag my songs into the player ... No special software to check in songs I already have (unlike the Panasonic).  Sound is good with a very good set of headsets.  Is very easy to use if you just want to play music while working out .. I use shuffle feature for random play.  I don't need them sorted.  If I did this player may not sort properly from what I've read.Minus - well , sort of ... I guess none are perfect. How funny. A big metal screw which requires a screw driver to hold battery cover.  Mine also broke right away .. but I just put a rubber band around it .. so it's no problem.  The cover just protects the battery, not hold it in place."
3108,"This is my 3rd attempt at an universal remote.  However, my initial impressions are quite positive.  The software wizard was user friendly.  I was concerned about entering the model number of my devices.  Each model no. is different and who knows whether or not to enter a dash, space, comma, etc.  Also, I read reviews as people complained about the fact a typo or extra space would produce negative results.  However, they actually provide sample model no.'s next to each device.  Therefore, you have an idea how you should enter your particular model no--not much mental effort involved after seeing the sample.I did have some trouble with it programming my Tivo remote.  Nevertheless, I got it to work.  As I tested the devices, the remote provided basic assistance whenever the devices either did not turn on or were on the incorrect settings until they were correct (I saw this as a big plus).I did not give it five stars for two primary reasons:1.  My DirecTV remote has several peculiar buttons (i.e., instant replay and a button that automatically takes you to Live TV) that were not immediately programmed.  However, I'm sure once I search further, I'll be able to program a button for them as well.2.  For my 5-disc CD player, it created two button to select the ""previous"" and ""next"" tracks.  Yet, it didn't create buttons to select different discs.  That is another modification I must make.However, for $120 (a special at Midnight), I consider this a very useful remote."
3109,"A few reviewers here said their package came with a return label to recycle their old battery, but mine didn't.I'll just take it to the nearest recycler, but a label would have been nice!"
3110,"I got this unit from Mediacom xtreme package internet here in Springfield Missouri.  No problem with the modem. Downstream averages 18-26 Mbps. That all depends on the connecting server your connecting too, how fast there connection is on the other end. I can connect fast to some, and slower to servers using old DSL or wirless.Only a one time issue is a one time glitch with my newer netgear dual band wirelss gateway. but thats only happened once. and all i had to do is reboot the modem, then gateway router, then computer in order to get it back up and running internet again. For the price half of the motorola new docsis 3 modems, its a good little modem.The motorola will gain you maybe a few Mbps but not enough to really notice., at least til cable companies change to Docsis 3 system."
3111,"I bought this after some research. I need one that can hold my DSLR with 50-200 zoom. It definitely works to that purpose. But it has no space for an additional lense. Anyway I wanted a very compact one from the beginning.It comes with one sticky pad/holder/separator. It has a relatively small hole, not big enough for the lens hood. I haven't figured out how to use the separator effectively.Great build quality. comfortable to carry around without drawing too many attentions."
3112,"I bought this a few years back for my s3 Canon camera did what I wanted it too do works well sense then I have given the camera to my wife justs loves along with the LAH-DC20,LHDC40 set."
3113,"This is a monster of an extension cord. We use it to run power heavy tools at a distance. Works like a charm every time. The lit ends help me see whether or not we have power. It is bulky and heavy, but worth it."
3114,"I took a leap and bought these.  I read reviews, talked to industry professionals (I work in entertainment and live events), and did some research.  Mainly it came down to these or the extended bass units.  I am glad I chose these.  If you are a bass-head, I would recommend the EB units.  The Super.fi 5 Pro's are all about overall clarity.  I am extremely satisfied with the sound that is produced.  Even better than my Sony studio monitoring cams.My only gripe was that I guess I am still not used to the comfort of the canal design.  Traveling as much as I do, i find that canal type phones drown out the plane better than the best active noise canceling headsets.  I am having issues finding the best tip to use for the most comfort.  I was pleased to see that the foam cushion tips, while feeling generally better than the others, did offer almost the same about of noise blockage as the plug tips.  Maybe I just need to find a better way to insert them or get new tips.Overall, best set of phones I have ever had.  The case is slick and easy to use.  I have had zero issues with the cables.  Great Product!"
3115,We needed this card for my son's older camera.  This was the perfect thing.  Not too expensive and works well.
3116,"Just what I needed for my boom box for playing music. I can only use 1 GB or 2 GB SD memory cards in the sound system, Glad some of the low sizes are still avaible, Local stores only cary 4 GB and up memory cards. My old unit just dos not use the larger sizes."
3117,"I just bought this case everything is good as advertised except fot the Front Bay, the slots is too tight for the 5.25 devices to fit. I have to forced it to slide inside, if the tabs on the side were not there then it's perfect fit."
3118,"I have a Panasonic Lumix ZS3, and this case fits it perfectly.  Not for putting in your pocket, but a good general case for packing your equipment on a trip, with a big external pocket to put spare batteries, and a small zippered external pocket for extra SDHC cards.  Decently padded, belt clip, long strap for putting it around your neck.  All for a great price."
3119,It seems the coax plugs on tvs keep getting put into harder to reach &#34;holes&#34;  I had a terrible time getting cables attached and snugged up.  This tool makes a world of difference.  It is easier on the fingers too then trying to twist the little metal connectors by hand.
3120,"I went with Sirius over XM for a few reasons.  One was Radio Margarataville, my personal favorite channel.  I had the FM modulator installed and it makes quite a difference in sound, Sirius should start including it in the package. The only down fall is I cannot get a signal in my house.  Even when I put the antenna at a window the signal is very unreliable.  They need to get more ground repeaters in my area."
3121,"I purchased this lens as a ""tourist lens"" to give me a little more reach than my Canon 28-200 zoom.  I have taken over 3,000 pictures with it, and I am very satisfied.  Picture quality is as good as the Canon lens, it is slightly smaller than the Canon lens, and it is less expensive.  ""Zoom creep"" is an annoyance, as is fumbling with the zoom lock switch which will lock the lens only in the 28 mm position.  Still, the lens is very versatile, allowing me to go from pretty wide to very zoomed on my Canon EOS 5D full frame camera.  This is an excellent lens when you know you'll be taking lots of pictures from varying vantage points with little time for changing lenses."
3122,"This product is nice for organizing. I wish couple of slots were a little bit wider to accommodate memory cards , they can fit but very tightly and with a danger of breaking it when trying to take them out. More colors would be nice, yellow, orange,  easy to find in a big black bag."
3123,"I've been using Verbatim CD-R discs for years and have had excellent results. It has been my experience that rarely have I had a ""bad disk"". I use the CD-Rs regularly at work for my job and these disks have always seem to be of the the highest quality and reliability. In the past 3 years, I started using DVD+R regularly with the same reliability. I would recommend this brand as they are an excellent value for the money."
3124,I have used Verbatim printable DVD's for some time now and have no complaints. They have performed very well on my MacPro. The best one to get is the glossy printable DVDs by Verbatim. Both have printed flawlessly on my Epson R200 & R220.
3125,"The product I received was as described. When I first received this product I was leery because it felt cheaply made, but I have had it for a few months now and it is still working great. I gave it a 4 because it would be nice if the plug prong folded into the device."
3126,"When it first arrived in the mail I was a bit scared because it does not look like the picture posted. It's a bit slimmer and the USB slot is on the side, not the back. I plugged it in, and it worked. This is so cheap though, that I wouldn't even mind buying another one in case this stopped working. I'm not ready to give Apple another $20+ to charge my iPod. 4star, only because the product image is not what I received."
3127,"I have a Garmin Nuvi 660 and have found it to be a fantastic product.  Although prices have come down quite a bit since I bought it in July 2007, it's still a bit pricy.  I was looking for a good unit to give as a gift, but I also wanted something that wasn't going to break the bank. After looking around a bit I decided on the Garmin c340.  It was well priced with a few good features including text-to-speech which announces ""Turn left on Elm Street"", and not just ""Turn Left"".  The two I gave my relatives are used frequently.  They've had them for about a year now and so far they are very pleased with their c340.  It lacks some of the bells & whistles that the more expensive nuvi models have, and it's bulky shape isn't as handy, but if your goal is to find an address or the travel necessities of fuel, food, etc., the c340 delivers very well for the money.  For anyone who has been frustrated finding and downloading directions, or has missing their share of unmarked turns, the world of GPS is the best thing to come along since the Texaco Road Map.  If you want to jump into GPS but don't want to go to the expense of a high end model, the c340 is a good value."
3128,"I am always looking for the ultimate keyboard since I am on the computer often at work and at home.  I am one of those people that do not enjoy typing on a laptop keyboard since it's too small.  I want that nice key stoke feedback from a full size keyboard and always liked the Microsoft Keyboard product offerrings.  When I came upon this one I was thinking how in the world am I going to type in this weird ergonomic position.  A couple of days later, I realized how could I have not been typing this way for so long.  Initially it does need some getting used too, but someone must have done the reasearch, since once you get started you will not want to go back to a normal position keyboard.  I also hope I am preventing further long term issues for my fingers, hands and wrists by typing in this ergo position, but for now I continue to like the feeback of the key strokes and at least mentally I believe I am typing even quicker and with more accuracy (I thank my lucky stars that I took Senior Year High School Typing Class!).The existence of a wrist pad is always good, but there is a plastic platform that can be installed underneath the keyboad to raise it off the surface which then angles your typing downwards in a supposed better ergo position.  I did notice there is no SLEEP button like from my previous keyboard, but you soon forget about this and just either use your mouse or close your laptop cover.In addition I have to say that I like the additional email function keys to further reduce your time using the mouse.  Especially that ""SEND"" button.  Lastly I always preferred a corded Keyboard since I keep the keyboard on a table surface at all times and dont' have to worry about charging the keyboard or replacing the batteries."
3129,"This is a very affordable AM/FM radio. The reception is pretty good overall, and the sound quality is fine. The battery life appears to be very good. As expected, it comes with cheap earbud headphones. I have been using it to listen to radio while I exercise. It looks pretty nice, too, IMHO.I have two minor problems with this unit. First, the tuning is done with a dial on the top, so it's easy to accidentally brush it and mess up your perfect tuning job. Secondly, the earphones are just a little bit too short for my use, and can catch on moving exercise equipment parts. I've done it many times, and now one of the earbuds is flaky, turning on and off at times."
3130,"I have been using this for over a month. I am very happy with it. Before you buy, u need to make sure that ur computer is high end (I got a newer PC just to use the webcam, I feel good about it).The color/picture quality is awesome, but camera is slow to respond to movements. Its better than many webcams I have observed over the internet. It does not have too many features but does a good job of what its intended to do. It does a neat job even when the room is low lit.But I have a query to all the webcam manufacturers, why do YOU ALL SUCK? The digi cams have improved so much over the years and there cost is going down too. But webcams are still lame in comparison."
3131,"Cable was shipped reasonably quickly, works like it's supposed to.  No problems.  If you have an older camcorder with a firewire connection and a newer Mac computer this cable will connect the two."
3132,"This lens is a very good lens, this lens is excellent.  In the macro mode, there's excellent contrast and saturation, and very good bokeh. The price is right, Very good sharpness. Doesn't have the fastest AF, At this price, this lens delivers more than I expected."
3133,"If you don't have a floppy drive anymore, and you occasionally need to read or write a floppy, this inexpensive unit will do the job.  It works under XP with no drivers.  It's a bit sluggish in the writing operation on my desktop but it did retrieve all the files from an old floppy and saved me a lot of typing.  I'm glad to have it around just in case, but I'm glad floppies have seen their day."
3134,"Very clever and useful design.  I use it with my camcorder and digital cam and it works well.  The best thing about this mini-tripod is it allows one to stabilize the camera against any nearby solid structure. Its an extension of the camera itself.  As a handle, it makes keeping the shot smooth and steady a breeze.  Highly recommended."

3137,"What can I say in a review?  It's a cable.  It may be a pin-to-pin standard cable, the likes of which I have seen selling for $3.50 to $5.00.  However, THIS is a KODAK cable, designed (I have to believe) to work solely with the Kodak Easy Share Digitial Camera.  I may have been taken in, but I wasn't going to risk my investment in the camera for a few dollars difference for a cable.  If you feel the same as I do, spend the extra and get this item."
3138,"I got this camera for Decembaer last year as a gift for myself, and i'm very please with what i got.the camera is very user friendly, actualy i first bought a Sony DSC-S90 but when i met at a firends home for diner at night with my wife and we took some pics, me with my Sony and my friend with his Nikon 4600, the results spoke for themselve, his photos where more bright and accurate in the same conditions than mine, and i took the same picture with both cameras, making use of the same ""ignorance / knowledge"" in this matter of digital photography and the results with the Nikon overuled the Sony. For this reason mainly i decided the next bussines day go back to the store and change the Sony for a Nikon and i bought the Coolpix L1. i have taken very nice pictures in all posible conditions, at the beach, sunsets, indoors, outdoors, at night, noon, etc and all great.read the manual in order to take the best out of this camera, but if you don't read it, still will get nice pics.the only thing i regret is the lack of a AF light, which definitly would make AF in low light easyer and faster, other than that, very niceJuly 11 2006 UPDATEAfter several month using my Nikon, i decided to change it because the time it takes to focus on most indoor conditions is too long most of the times. i looked imn the market and decided to go for Sony again but this time i bought the DSC-W50, and the change is amazing, better AF speed and accuracy, not to mentiont the better flash power in night conditions.i dislike the quiality of the Nikon's pics at night, but i'm very satisfied with the results with the DSC-W50.I cannot say the Nikon is a bad camera, but for sure there are better options for the price range.i took my time to research and went for the Sony over Samsung and equally priced Panasonics, not to mention Cannon (i was afraid with so many comments regarding some misterius lense error a lot of people complains about)If i could i'd lower the stars for this camera to 3 instead of the 4 i gave it a whyle ago."
3139,"I've been using several of Logitech's past keyboard/mouse combo models and have always been pleased with the performance. I'm pretty hard on my keyboards, so my last one finally gave up and this model looked great. The mouse and keyboard are ergonomically great, the keys are much quieter than my last model (something my office mates appreciate!) and the mouse battery indicator and docking station are great features.I haven't found the LCD display to be of much use yet, but I haven't learned enough about what I can do with it. The only setup issue I have is that I can't seem to get all software installed due to a bluetooth incompatibility of some sort. It all works fine, so I'm sure I'll forget about it and use it as-is.The only disappointment I've had so far is the ""touch sensitive"" slider and music command keys. They are far less effective than the past wheel-type volume controls. It takes me several times to the get controls to respond, and you have to press down quite hard (this isn't like a touchpad, which you might expect). The touch-sensitive controls look cool, but fall short of being what I'd expect from Logitech.Overall I'm pretty pleased with the upgrade and don't regret the choice - especially for the Company A price and free shipping!"
3140,"Well designed.  I can get a lot more stuff in this bag than any other that I own of the same, relative size.  What's neat is that I can ""swivel"" the bag around and access just about anything in it.  I spent the extra $bucks  to get the weather protection feature."

3142,"I wrote a 4 star review some time ago, however I'd demote it a couple of stars now. I've actually owned two of these and both broke in a short period of time. The internal wiring is very sensitive, and the case splits open easily. Both units lasted about 6-8 weeks. Walmart now sells a no-name unit for around $10 which is far superior to this."

3144,"I purchased this UPS for a child going to college. Rather than just a power strip, I want something that should condition the electricity coming from the grid more to protect the devices attached to the UPS.I have many of these at work. This UPS works as designed. No complaints."
3145,"I have had my Palm TX now for about 3 months. I have had a Palm Vx, m515, and now this one, and its capabilities blow the others away. The screen is fantastic. I love the extra space and resolution, plus the landscape mode. Having wifi is a huge plus even though I don't have a wireless network at home or work. With the better processor, this is also super fast. It sorts through 300 records in Smartlist in about a second.Still I had some disappointments:The screen isn't glass like the Vx. This probably makes it less likely to crack, but it makes the grafitti area more likely to be damaged and an overlay, at least in the grafitti area is a must. Even using a protector, I still had problems with grafitti skipping (like an ""o"" might become a ""c"" plus a blob even though I wrote an ""o"") and wound up returning the first one I got after about a month. If you don't bear down, it will skip. If you do bear down you are more likely to damage the screen. I have to take a star off for that.I use a lot of third-party programs and many of them simply don't work or will crash the TX. Generally I can find substitutes, but I still miss some of that and it was an ordeal at the beginning. I don't think ""hacks"" are allowed anymore at all. But anything still being developed works fine. Also I really miss the old grafitti. I couldn't get used to the new version which seemed incredibly slow and clumsy. Fortunately there is a way to get the old version back.I don't see why they couldn't make the silkscreen ""buttons"" customizable like the actual buttons are. In fact you should be able to change the icons. I don't use the Palm for e-mail and the media button is also kind of useless for me. I'd rather have the calculator and search buttons back.The browser has problems. Wikipedia just shows up as a vertical line of letters (there is workaround for this problem documented on Wikipedia, but it only works for that site). Also, if you don't crash while browsing, it isn't uncommon to crash shortly *after* browsing in a different program. Some secure websites simply won't work at all. I have to cut Palm some slack on that since handheld devices can't have browsers as good as a desktop, but being able to turn the screen to landscape should solve most things and it simply doesn't here. There is no excuse for the crashes.Despite the negatives, there were some nice surprises too:I love using the Palm as an MP3 player. Among MP3 players it is bulky, but since I'm carrying it anyway, it really takes no additional space. I use the included pTunes player and bought a 2 GB card with several hundred songs on it and I love it. I use the Palm more than my 20 GB iPod now.It also makes a great video player. Once I figured out the right mix of tools, I was able to put DVD's on another 2 GB card. I can put 8 episodes of my favorite TV shows on one of those cards and it looks great using the free full-screen TCPMP player. People are amazed with that feature. The screen is bigger and has more resolution than a 5G iPod.Battery life is surprisingly good. It's nothing like the Vx which lasted a week or more, but it is as good as the m515 even playing an occasional movie and using the mp3 player.The integration of everything could be better, but that's part of the deal with an open platform. This thing is like an iPhone, only without the phone. And you can buy it today for much less money."
3146,"I bought this because I was giving some discs to a family member and wanted a way to keep them organized. I've owned many storage folders and this one is just like the rest. I do not know about the quality because I only filled it up and gave it away. For the price, you can't beat it."
3147,"This little device saved me tons of time being lost. I just punch in where I'm going and it takes me right there. I had this device going on 2 years and it still works perfect. The suction cup that came with this device is not good at all. My I5 took close to 10 falls from my windshield to the dashboard, surprisingly it still works! The I5 was build to last. You can use the included DC power cord or AA batteries. I would recommend using rechargeable batteries because this sucks the life out of AA batteries in a couple of hours. It takes some time punching in the addresses since you have to scroll to each character. You can save tons of addresses in advance for easy use or use the built in Location menu to find restaurants, gas stations, clubs, movie theater, etc in the area (love that feature). When you get your I5 register it so you can get the updated software. You have to unlock your maps software in order to get updates. I didn't know this till now. THE I5 DOES NOT WORK WELL/AT ALL IN MANHATTAN. I live in the Bronx and as soon as I get to Manhattan the I5 can't locate a satellite (steer clear of Manhattan with the I5). Other than that I love my I5 and would buy it again in a heart beat especially now that its way less than what I paid.  If you have any questions at all just comment it and I'll reply ASAP. Hope this helped."
3148,"Overall I am happy with the MacBookPro.  Lots of positives.  Problems include 1)too hot to handle, uncomfortably hot when used as a laptop.2)Kept shutting down after a few minutes of battery use.

I believe that I bought too early.I have an Imac which is awesome, and receives an A+."
3149,"I was looking for a replacement for an old Rio Sport that finally just must have gotten dropped too many times. I looked into the Shuffle, but since I've not used iTunes, was used to a display, and didn't see the need to spend twice the money, I went with this one.I really like it. The controls and menus are more intutive for me than the Rio's, and the display is nice and big. I was looking solely for a workout player - no need for the big jukebox - and this delivers. I do wish that it came with a belt clip - the only option that arrives in the box is the arm band - but I think it's just a matter of getting used to running with something on my arm. I may try to rig it with a lanyard, but that's just a personal preference.The battery life appears to be great. The radio works, the ear buds are typical for this kind of player (in other words, if you have headphones you already like, you could just use them - for a workout, these are fine for me.)It does not have a slot to expand the memory, but again, for my workout purposes, I don't need more than what's here in the first place. I don't want to work out to every song that I own, and I use the random function to avoid repetitive workout soundtracks. The 512 memory holds enough that I don't hear every song every day by any means, and sometimes it takes two or three before I feel that I've covered everything.I think this is a great value for the money. I don't have enough ""peppy songs"" to justify a bigger memory for more money. My gym does have TVs with audio routed through a radio, so the little extras like the radio - rarely used, but available - sent me straight to this one over the more expensive iPod options, and I'm very pleased with the results. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? I don't know, and now I can't change it! It doesn't feel like a ""rave about it"" product, but I will say that it works perfectly, is a great value, and I can find nothing negative to say."
3150,"I bought theseSpectra SMPS-300 Portable Stereo Speaker Systemand was very, very disappointed in them. Paid $10 more for a power supply that was a total waste of good money after bad. Got a 1 star from me only because there is no 0 stars!The JBL's are perfect for my needs.  Loud enough to hear over an ocean, small and portable, plays on batteries and has nice sound.  THESE are what you are looking for!  The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because for some reason, they package these things like you are opening Fort Knox gold!  VERY frustrating packaging! Thick, hard to cut, and you MUST cut three seams.  Stupid packaging for a great product!"
3151,"It's what was offered. Seems to be a real, original 32 gb card. I will test further for more proof."
3152,"Read the other reviews for physical characteristics --  metal face plate, an open shell.  Then use patch cables to connect each port to a port in a 10/100/1000 Switch or Router --  it is better than crimping individual male RJ45 connectors.(1) I bought 2 (March & June 2014) and the punch down wire labeling is different than the posted photo (06/2014) -- my units have color schemes on a ""key guide"" decal between the 2 row of contacts  -- the decal didn't line up well with each wire contact and I mistakenly punched in 2 wires in a couple of contacts, causing me to redo the cable (tear off new insulator, etc.).  It requires concentration when you're doing a batch, several or all 12 ports  -  you have to look at the decal for the 568A/B color and then punch down the wire  --  the photo shows a version where contacts are color indicated instead of a key decal.(2) Strongly suggest you use a Sharpie to mark the start of each ""grouping"" of 4 contacts on each row (4 left + 4 right = 1 port); otherwise, it's confusing to see where 1 wire group ends and another begins.  You could accidentally bypass a contact or double-up on a used one when you doing a batch or all 12 ports.(3) The kit doesn't come with dust caps for the terminals which I think come with Monoprice brand panels (the whole panel is exposed to dust) and keystones.(4) To punch down, mount the panel with the back facing you (exposing the port backs).  Strongly recommend having a micro flush cutter (like a Xuron 170-II) to cut Cat 6 spline, and the trim off excess wire in case your 110/Krone tool doesn't trim wire).  Visually compare each wire contact with the wiring decal.  When finished, suggest you bundle the cables with a nylon tie or tape (outside of the panel), then unmount the panel, turn it so the ports (fronts) face you, and press to re-mount the panel.Regardless, I strongly recommend using a circuit tester (either an unreliable $7 or a nice TrendNet @ $35)  --  the tester will confirm contact fit and pairing, and if you're doing all 12 ports, that's 96 wires and 48 pairs, so testing before patching to a switch will give you confidence in the next steps and confirm you punched down correctly.  (Do not patch any port to a Switch while you're testing - - the tester's 9v battery could fry the Switch or the tester could be damaged, or both)."

3158,"After I bought my nikon D200, I knew that it just a matter of time before I will purchase one for my camera. Reading all the reviews here, I finally break down and ordered thru Company A. I read the manual and installed the Grip to my D200. What a big difference It handle better. I order this grip even though I have total of 4 batteries for my D200. Now I have more peace of mind that I can carry AA for spare in my Back Pack. For the latch to hold the cover, I finally figure out not to break it by pushing the cover gently while slowly turning the latch without forcing it , so not to break the locking mechanism inside. I love the feel in my hand , use it to my tripod without removing the grip and it is very stable. Plus I also ordered the cable release for really sharp picture shooting. For the price you can't go wrong. Very easy to shoot potrait now. I have wedding to do this March so, I'm ready to rock with my Nikon D200, SB 800 and my Spare Nikon D70.

3159,"This backpack is tough, really tough, and it holds a lot of stuff.I've used this backpack every day for the past 4 years, and its still going strong.I'm even considering buying two more just in case they ever stop producing this awesome bag. (Hey it happened to FireFly)(This backpack accommodates my Thinkpad T500 15.4"" with the larger 9 cell battery)Update:I bought a backup, and the design of the bag has changed since I first purchased it:The best part of the bag, the outside bottom, was leather. It is just nylon now. :(The inner pocket zipper is gone. (the main compartment)  They replaced it with a lower mesh pocket without the zipper. :(There was a small pocket for papers in the laptop area.

3161,"I don't understand the negative reviews others have given this product! They are solid, well-made binoculars with good lenses. They are hefty without being too heavy, the grip feels good in the hand, the focus ring works well, and they seem to be well made. Yes, the ""neckstrap"" is just a string, but So What? They are the perfect size to put in a purse or a backpack and the focus is much sharper than I expected.To the person who mentioned that the binoculars ""Doesn't appear to have a left eye adjustment""...you obviously don't know how to use the diopter on binoculars: Close your RIGHT eye, while looking through your left eye, adjust the focus as you would normally . Then, close your LEFT eye and DO NOT ADJUST THE FOCUS. There is an adjustment ring around the viewfinder for the RIGHT EYE. With your left eye closed, look with your right and use the diopter to adjust the focus. Then, when you open BOTH eyes, the focus is perfectly adjusted. Since everyone's eyes are different, each user will have to adjust them for their own use. But that is standard with all binoculars, no matter what the price. I think the focus and the clarity are great for a $25 product! I'm very happy with them."

3164,"I had a pair ofAudio Outfitters ULTRAEARS In-Ear Earphonesbut they seemed to walk away from my desk one day.  I stumbled upon the Smokin Bud while looking for replacements and thought I'd give them a shot.  The only thing I didn't like about the UltraEars was how dirty they got, these seemed like a great alternative.  Unfortunately, I don't have the UltraEars to do a side by side comparison, by my memory says that the lead wire for these is thinner than that of the SX-70, we'll see how they hold up.  Also, these don't seem as efficient as the SX-70, although that is not really a problem becasue I had to listen at the lowest volume setting at work anyway.  Sound quality seems comparable, although they don't seem as full sounding, but I could be imagining that, it is not a drastic difference.  On the plus side, they are cheaper, come with a decent case, and the inline volume control is a nice touch.  All in all, you can't go wrong for the price."
3165,"It works very well, quite amazing actually. Lots of fun and good info furnished. Would be very valuable to teach kids about the stars. My only complaint is that it requires the use of ear buds, so it is impossible for more than one person to hear the spoken information. I overcame this by buying a small speaker and plugging that into the unit instead of the ear buds, makes it much more fun when everyone can hear the info. Had it not been for this shortcoming, I would have given it 5 stars."

3167,"I have researched other CD storage devices and there are not very many of them.  Out of all them, the Century CD is the most cost effective.  Learning to use the product was a bit of a stretch.  I too am an IT guy and had a hard time figuring this thing out.  But one you learn it, I think it's pretty ingenious.  Again, not user intuitive.It creates a snapshot of the files stored on the discs you store.  So essentially it stores all the file names and disc names (which are customizable) in its own database.  When you want a particular file, you just double click on it and the disc will pop out.What I didn't like was the sound it makes when you first start up your computer.  You cant use it without a computer by the way.It sounds like a car starting.  But other than that it's pretty quiet.  I also didn't like how it looked.  Kind of clunky and ugly compared to the Media Carousel by Ziotech.I haven't stacked the 2nd organizer so I don't really know  how that would work.  I currently have the functioning organizer on my desk and couldn't imagine how two of those things stacked together would look.The 2nd one could be a nice gift..."
3168,"This cable works with my HP LaserJet 6L in Windows XP Pro SP2.  I give it 4-stars instead of 5, because I had to do some fiddling with the Port setting to be recognized (USB001 instead of LPT1)."
3169,"This item is awesome but for one little feature that was missing - the ability to tell the remote which room a device is in. I bought this PURELY to be able to control my central cable box/DVR from anywhere in the house...only to realize there is no way to split the activities based on what room you are in.You can sort of work around it by naming your activities prefixed with a tag for the room...but I'm certain it could be supported pretty easily...the Logitech software even has an area for you to configure which location a device is in, but you can't add any except the one default location.With that said, everything is working great with this remote, I can use it to control everything in my family room and in my home theater, with all my home theater equipment hidden. I can watch recorded shows in either place, and only have to pay for one HD/DVR cable box rental. Now if only I didn't have to remember to bring it with me when i move to different rooms. Will have to buy a 2nd one eventually.All my equipment was 'known' by the website, both newer and older equipment. The configuration is not perfect, it takes some time to run through the activities and for the remote to actually sync, and when you are first setting things up it will take a while because you may have to do some tweaking, and with each tweak you need to re-sync and test again.Overall I love it."
3170,"The 76cx is a great little GPS. I can't believe how well it stays locked on even when in the car below the dash panel. I use it between boat and car and did understand before purchasing that two software packages were needed before it would guide me either street by street or navigate the waterways.The screen is quite small, but readable. The rubber cover that goes over the USB port on the back came off. It is held in place with a tiny phillips head screw. When I took out the screw to reattach the cover, it fell on the floor and was impossible to find again. That is my only complaint so far."
3171,"This thing is amazing.  I''ve had the 205 for a few days now and have gotten several runs in with it, although I plan to use it for biking as well.  There are obviously lots of cool things you can do with it in building maps of your runs, then taking those runs, turning them into courses, and then racing against yourself later.However, the core reason I wanted it was for:- Mileage estimates- To get feedback on speed/pacingFirst Mileage Estimates - I never knew how far I was running and just took a guess. Now I am training for a marathon and that wasn't cutting it.  I tried to use a mapping website where I digitized my routes using a mouse on the PC.  Turns out if I mapped the run 3-4 different times, I'd get as much as a mile difference in a 15 mile run.  Not good enough.So this thing nails it on mileage and now I don't too far or too short in training.Feedback for speed/pacing - As I've never known how far I have run, a stop watch didn't do much good for estimating how fast I am running - only how long I ran for.  When I tried to do speed workouts or slow 10+ minute per mile recovery runs, I never knew if I was going slow enought to truly recover.Now I know how fast I am going.  The instant pace feedback is not that great, but the lap pace is very good. I realize now I have a tough time running slower than 10 minutes per mile so it is helping to discipline myself.  I haven't done a speed workout yet, but it will be great to see how my training is coming along and if I am on target to meet my pacing goals to run a 1:45 half marathon.Also - calories burned.  Some reviews mention this is way off.  There is a firmware update that corrects this and it is fairly accurate now.  I've compared what forerunner says with some web based estimation tools and I'm comfortable with the 205's calorie estimates.The reason for only the 4 star rating:- Garmin training software is fairly simple. I have opted to use a freeware SW version called Sporttracks by zonefivesoftware.com.  Great mapping capabilites and the reporting, analytical tools are better.  Not as intuitive to use, but for a free package it is better than what Garmin provides.- Also, some of the extras on the Garmin are useless.  Stuff like the % grade is way inaccurate, and the elevation is questionable.Bottom line - if you want a tool to improve your training and don't want to be tied down to a system that uses a footpod and/or want to build maps of your runs, this is a winner.UPDATE - I rarely go abck and update reviews, but I wanted to post that around mid-year 2010, the Garmin crapped out on me.  So it lasted about 3.5 years.  First, about a year ago it started to be a pain to get it to sync up.  I had to keep cleaning the contacts off with an eraser from a pencil.  Then a few months ago I started getting ""Satellite Reception Lost"" in the middle of a run with a clear view of the sky.  It became more and more frequent until the thing would barely hold the satellite for more than 5 minutes at a time. I stopped using it.  I miss it sometimes, but also now enjoy running ""just to run"" without worrying so much about pace, distance.  At the current price of about $120, I would recommend it still, especially if you are training for any type of race.  I probably logged about 1500 miles in the 3.5 years that I used it."
3172,"I got this unit for my birthday, and I've been enjoying it a bunch.  Without garmin maps it isn't so fun, but with the metro maps it is really a blast.  I like the built in compass feature for geocaching."
3173,"I find the Garmin 305 to be a great running tool.  It gives you instant feedback and lets you track your workouts.  I just recently started increasing my running from about 5 miles a week to 15+ a week.  Having a ""toy"" to play with and see how it works has helped my stay motivated to keep running and increase my distances.  The work out feature is great and makes planning my weeks running easy (especially on those mornings when I feel like taking it easy but my watch tells me not to).  I would like to see it get a satellite fix quicker but it isn't too bad.  Heart rate monitor works perfect."
3174,"I purchased this GPS watch as a replacement for my Garmin 205 (which replaced my 201). While the design is basically the same, it adds a heart rate monitor (and extra cost).The 305 provides a wide range of features that are specified in the product description, so I will not recap them here. Rather, I will focus on the positive and negative features of the device.On the positive side, the GPS is considerably improved from earlier models. It can even acquire a satellite lock inside my house, through the skylights or even through a glass door. While running, it has been able to keep the lock even under trees-with a few exceptions involving thicker forest. I run mainly on wooded trails and it works quite well under those conditions. The GPS is also quite accurate-I've tested it against certified courses and it has been dead on.I was never one to use a heart rate monitor before, but I decided to go with the 305 because it was only slightly more than the 205 (at least when I was buying) and I had been informed that training with a HRM can be beneficial. The HRM works well-that is, it seems to report the HR correctly. Naturally, it still uses the chest strap (so, you'll look like you are wearing a bikini top or bra from the back if you run shirtless). The strap battery is a standard type and can easily be replaced by the user. The strap comes with the 305-at least the version I bought. Because it has a receiver for the HRM, it can also connect to other accessories, such as the Garmin footpod. I don't have that since I always train outside.The device also connects to your PC via a USB cable and uploads (or downloads) data. The included software is adequate, but you can also use third party software such as Sports Tracks. While I am not a super data sort of person, I do find it interesting to have information about my running available, most especially races.The device has a rechargeable battery that cannot be replaced by the user and recharges from a cradle. The cradle can plug into an outlet or a USB port. I've found that the battery life is as advertised and recharge rates are reasonably quick.On the minus side, the device is not waterproof-you can get it wet, but swimming with it would be a bad idea. Garmin does have a newer model that is properly waterproof, so if you are doing triathlons or swimming, don't get the 305.The device is also fairly bulky relative to sports watches, although this does allow for a large screen that can easily display four data fields. I have no problem running with it and do not really notice the weight difference-but I have been wearing a GPS watch while running for a few years now.The controls are okay (that is, usable but not great), but be sure to only push the side (rubbery) buttons with your fingertips rather than using your nail. If you use your nail, you'll eventually wear down the buttons.I did have some locking up problems with my 205, but none yet with my 305. Of course, I've only had it a while.Overall, if you are looking for a GPS watch and HRM, this is a good product. I got mine for an excellent price here at Company A, so look for a deal."
3175,"This is a decent and effective armband, and at the price, it's hard to beat. But there are a couple of disadvantages buyers should be aware of. First, the strap is pretty long. That's fine with me, but if your arms are tiny, this thing is going to fit very loosely.Second, there's a screen protector -- just a piece of clear plastic -- but if you don't look carefully for it, you're bound to throw it out with the packaging, as I did. It's attached to the packaging with tape, and the tape on mine had dried out and was impossible to remove without damaging the protector itself. So, no protector.The case itself is black rubber and fits the ipod a bit loosely and thus it tends to move around. That's not a total disadvantage since you'll have to push the case away from the connectors every time you want to sync or attach the headphones. That's because the case, just barely overlaps the relevant ports. Not a big disadvantage, just an annoyance.On the good side, the armband is easily removeable, so you can keep the ipod in your pocket, with the case on, but without the bulk of the strap. That's a big win. And there's no plastic covering the scroll wheel. I've seen other armbands (Apple's, for example) with plastic coverings there and they tend to make the scroll wheel unresponsive. Also, the rubber feel of the case is good and it clearly protects the ipod and makes it easier to hold (because it's not slippery). The fact that it's black is good -- it doesn't show dirt. Finally, the armband feels quite good -- a nice amount of stretch, not too much.All in all, I'd buy it again. And at the price it's a great deal. But if it were to cost more, I wouldn't be so sure."
3176,"I use this lens with an APS-C sensor camera which converts this lens to an effective focal length of 150mm.  This allows for a comfortable distance between the subject and lens at close range at the expense of a very narrow depth of focus.  The lens is sharp; however, there is noticeable diffraction distortion (loss of sharpness) at f16 and beyond.  This lens is best suited for full frame cameras for which it was designed."
3177,"I hate companies that flat out lie about their products.  A 12 GA wire is rated for a fixed amperage.  If you really need 12 GA wires you will melt this cable in a matter of minutes possibly causing a fire.  Everything Pyle sells they claim 2-3 times the actual ratings (amplifiers, cables).  When they get sued for the fire their cable caused I'm sure they will say something like two 14GA wires equals 12GA.  This is a good cable, but people need to be warned that it's not really 12GA wire inside.Now the cable is a very nice ~14-16GA cable.  It is made of coper wire and has good 1/4"" metal ends that have been soldered on.  The jacket is thick but still flexible.  Inside the jacket there are two separate 14-16GA wires.  One is red and the other is white.  There is no metal foil shielding in the jacket (shielding would have been very nice).I bought one 30' cable and cut it into two cables with 1/4"" TS and bare wire ends.  My speakers have binding posts but my amp has 1/4"" speaker outputs.  I got two really good 15' (30' / 2) speaker cables for less than $15.  I plan on buying more of these as I don't need real 12GA speaker wires.  As an comparison, a standard 20A 120V (2400 watts) power outlet is wired with 12GA wire.I took one star off because of the overrating of the wire size.  Advertise it with the correct wire size and it's a 5 star product."
3178,"1. The right side is purposely longer than the left so you can pass the right side around the back of your neck. I did not know this in the beginning.2. The sound quality was great. It blocks out outside noise; do not use while driving and be careful when crossing the street with these. I didn't hear a car horn once.3. As with my previous earbuds I noticed a slight crackle in sound about a month after use which I believe was wear of the very thin wire near the jack. My previous set of earbuds (bass freq, another brand) had this same problem and eventually stopped working altogether. So as soon as I heard that familiar crackle I added a piece of duct tape to stabilize the wire near the jack so it wouldn't wear from bending when I put it in my pocket. Six months later it works great!"
3179,"I didn't like the asymmetrical cord so I went and bought the Sony mdr-ex75 for my sansa view. I bought the Lenntek Sonix at costco because I need a second one but returned within the same day. I was about to get the second Sony earbuds but the price and glowing reviews made me go for the Cx-300 and it turned out to be the best out of 3. The Lenntek has so much bass and no midrange and high freq. The Sony has good midrange and clarity but no bass at all. The Cx-300 has decent bass and good midrange and high freq and it made me realized the sony doesn't have bass. It's very small and fits wells in my ears. I don't like the asymmetrical cord but I can trade for the sound quality.To those who have problem with the noise with the in ears buds when jogging, use a small piece of masking tape to fix the cord to your shirt. I usually tape it right at the collar and the length from there to your ears should be not to tight so you can turn your head and not too loose."
3180,"The SP-320 is an improved version of SP-320. It has digital image stabilization similar to Fuji cameras and an increased ISO 800 number. An interesting feature is the raw mode allowing to capture image from the CCD sensor directly without compression artifacts (very few cameras have this). The colors are good and resolution satisfactory with lens giving relatively soft images. It provides satisfactory prints. Good colors and exposure. Uses two AA batteries - rechargeable NiMH of large capacity are recommended. Many features, including manual adjustments and a histogram."
3181,"Product functions as advertised and seems to be of slightly higher quality than some others listed.As others have stated, the wrist strap is not all that large, which for me is not an issue but may be something others need to take under consideration."
3182,"Let me say it will not ""detangle"" the phone cord, but it keeps the phone cord from getting ""as tangled"" as without.The ""detangler"" did not fit my phone, I had to take a dremel tool and route out the jack just a bit to make room for the detangler.After the ""surgery"" I did to the phone handset, the product is working - that is it connects the handset to the base without static.  And it does prevent some tangling of the cord."
3183,It works great for what I bought it for. It is very durable and light weight. It does what it's supposed to.
3184,"I purchased an OmniMount shelf to hold the projector in my theater.  It looks great and holds the projector well.  It also cost a small fraction of what anything sold as a projector mount (rather than a shelf) would.  My biggest complaint is not having a way to lock the shelf in position.  Instead it can be turned freely right or left.  My theater has room/seat shaking during corresponding events of movies, which can knock the shelf out of position and make the projector misaligned. It would also be nice if there was support built in for mounting without a stud."
3185,"I have been very satisfied with this product, and as always the battery life is wonderful. One flaw, I found is the mouse is more sensitive than its previous versions. The pointer needs to be slowed down (from Control Panel). Apart from that, this product is simply the best in its class."
3186,"Very nice, solidly built, easy-to-use camera that feels good in my hand.  I got my A540 as a Christmas present a little over 5 years ago.  It blows away the camera in my smartphone, an original Verizon Motorola Droid that I got used less than 2 years ago.What I like about my A540:- Easy to use.  The menus and displays are easy to access and navigate.  Just about anyone, even non-techies, can take good pictures in Auto mode... just gotta tell them to hold the shutter down halfway for a few seconds before snapping the picture.- Takes nice still pictures and acceptable standard def. video with full resolution (640*480) and framerate (approx. 30 frames/second).- The TV-out.  My first digicam, an HP Photosmart 210, didn't even have a TV-out.- Takes AA batteries.  I keep several spare alkaline and rechargeable AA's in my camera bag.  When the ones in the camera run out, I just simply take them out and pop in a fresh set of AA's.  No need to wait for a proprietary battery to recharge.Gripes:- The flash takes a long time to recharge (maybe 5-10 seconds or so).  I really wish Canon would have sacrificed a bit of compactness and made the A540 to take 4 AA batteries instead of just two to lessen the flash recharge time.- The LCD display is almost impossible to see in sunlight- Don't get rid of your camcorder.  The video and sound quality, while OK, aren't as good as those of my Sony Digital8 camcorder that I've had for over 8 years- No image stabilization!  This makes it more difficult to take pics in low light or indoor pics with the flash turned off.- Only takes 2GB SD cards or less.  Does not accept any SDHC cards (4GB or more)If I were to upgrade, it would be either to an Canon Powershot A590 (similar to the A540 but with optical image stabilization) or to a digital SLR (their cost and bulk are the main holdbacks)."
3187,The mic works great. Easy to hookup to the iPod and easy to get the audio files off of the iPod when hooking it up to a computer. Much simpler then digital voice recorders I have tried in the past.
3188,"I rate it 4 stars because it is descent quality sound.  The batteries tend to last all day.  Comes with a charging unit, batteries, and adjustable headset.  Stereo."
3189,Solid- Works as advertised and is a quality cable. Recommended. What more can I say about a good cable to use up the word minimum.. Works well.
3190,"I would have loved to have found my older model version with the buttons on the face but it wasn't available.  this model plays smooth, looks cool and I'm still getting used to the tiny buttons on its side.  So far, it plays great."
3191,"I agree that this is a delightful little postage stamp size thingy. It's a low cost gem that holds lots of music, and plays it very nicely. Actually the only thing I have to add beyond other reviews that I have read (who actually is going to read all of them) is a comment on the sound quality.I bought mine, and walked around with it for awhile, and thought, gosh this is great. After a bit I got a little out of sorts about the fact that you don't have a menu to go exactly where you want to go. So I bought the big 30g ipod. My big surprise was the infinitely better sound quality of the big iPod. I used a good pair of Sennheiser earphones on both of them, and there is utterly no comparison. I listen to classical music and I do like to be able to tell the difference between a flute and a flugelhorn in the orchestra. This little iPod has its place, but if you really want top notch sound it just won't do. One big problem is the striking lack of bass. I had assumed that although this unit lacks the bells and whistles of its big brothers it would still push out the same sound as the more expensive ones. Wrong.Some reviewers deplore the lack of a video screen and menu on the Shuffle iPod. That's like buying a Corolla and complaining that it doesn't have the features of a Lexus. You get what you pay for."
3192,"I rented an older model previous to the R15 that had problems freezing and stopping on us.  Direct TV had me do a hard reset, which fixed the problem temporarily and then it began again.  It was so severe, I called them up again and insisted they replace my unit, which they did (I had signed up for their protection plan).  It came quickly and I sent the old unit back, which they paid for.  This R15 is smaller than my old one, which I like; and so far, it doesn't freeze and stop.  It responds quickly to the remote and I have no complaints.  If the freezing starts happening, I will be sure to come back to update this review.UPDATE 5/5/13: The freezing has not returned.  I've had no problems with this unit since I've gotten it."
3193,"I bought these about 5 years ago (2007). I got them to replace the factory speakers in my '95 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I had them running off of a Pioneer head unit initially. Compared to the blown stock speakers, these were great. They didn't sound all that great off of the head unit though. Where they really came alive was when I ran them off of a 4 channel Kicker amp feeding them 70w RMS to each side. They sounded MUCH MUCH better then they did off of the head unit.For the price, they aren't too bad sounding over all, but they weren't clear enough for me. They sounded sort of tinny and just an overall cheap sound. The clarity I wanted wasn't there. I eventually upgraded to a set of Image Dynamics Ctx65cs component speakers. Those speakers sound amazing and you really can't beat them for $160. The only problem I had was that the Image Dynamic woofers were too deep (@ 2.75"") and didn't fit in my doors, so I bought a set of kick pods to mount them in. They sound even better down there.Hifonics Pros: Very Cheap, can get loud, shallow woofer mounting depth (2.44"")Cons: Tinny; sound quality just isn't there"
3194,"With over 840 reviews, what is left to say? The product works well enough, although I have experienced blue lines running across the screen during the music transfer process. This has happened a few times, but I was able to reset the Sansa with no loss of data. I've owned this item for about 7 months and use it 2x a week maximum. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the item - it has proven to be too big for jogging/walking, and once you add a protector case (which is a must), it gets quite bulky. I have not used the video, picture, or voice features at all, I barely need 2GB, and in the sun the screen is useless. My advice: just be very careful to not buy more than what you really need in an MP3 - save as much as you can so you can upgrade more often. The product is easy to operate though and has held up, so I'd recommend it to people who are considering it."
3195,"Got this unit with a LCD TV purchase with huge (humongous) discount, so I though, what the heck, I'll give it a shot. First steps were discouraging, although setup is easy, device connects well via USB and connection to Logitech is smooth. Problems started after that, as I was adding more and more components and Harmony's auto setup steps failed to configure everything properly, but in part due to some of my errors and a few small details I overlooked.Setting up components is fairly simple and Logitech's database does most of the work for you. It is, however, EXTREMELY important to understand how ""Activities"" function works and how it needs to be configured. This is the core of Harmony's ""brain"" and if you fail there, you'll be quite disappointed with it, like so many negative reviews here suggest.To make a long story short, after a couple of days playing with the device I love it! Once you fully understand how to set it up and tweak it, it's absolutely great. Have all my AV in the house on this single unit, some nine or ten of them and all work great. Even some older components, including some old DVD player, another not so common brand and somewhat old cable box (actually, both of my cable boxes are not that new, just about to upgrade to HD-DVR, so I was pleasantly surprised that Harmony ""recognized"" them without any problem).I yet have to experiment and use this remote more. Didn't give it five stars just because of occasional goofy behavior, but certainly nothing too bad, worrisome or too annoying.People who gave one star reviews to this toy probably got frustrated right in the beginning and/or failed to understand and follow ALL instructions very carefully. Given an amazing number of supported components, both old and new, I find it hard to believe that customers could not make them work properly. I suspect human error in majority of cases. Once you set up Harmony properly and start using it, you'll see how convenient and even intuitive it is. Nice design, too. I was thinking about getting another one, but most of the components it controls are in a single room that I use 80% of the time. When I want to use others in other rooms, I just take Harmony with me. Fortunately, other family members haven't gotten hooked to it yet so they don't care. Once they do, I'll have no choice but to buy another one. I suspect that some newer models may be even more enticing, but would have to look into that."
3196,"7x50mm binocular works great off my porch no focusing issues. I like them better than my Winchester 42mm hunting binoculars already, because there is a wider field of view.We will see how it fairs on the open seas....The lens caps don't seem too strong. Hopefully I don't end up testing the flotation capability."
3197,"I have nothing more to say regarding how this case protects the camera. The thick leather hide will cushion some force to protect the camera, especially the lens area and the LCD."
3198,"This camera costs almost twice as much as the VX-3000, and it is debatable whether it offers enough for the price difference to be worthwhile. The VX-3000 is a very good buy and no doubt will make most average users very happy. That said, however, the VX-6000 does offer superior quality for those who want it, and still offers a better quality/price ratio than comparable Logitech or Creative products. Image is EXTREMELY crisp, and many of my on-line chat pals have commented that they were impressed. The wide-angle lens is also a big plus (in fact, it was what made me decide to pay more and get it), and it works well with little light.On the down side, two things:1) The absolutely irritating ""Windows Live Call"" button that gets easily pressed by accident and pops up Windows Live Messenger (still widely known as MSN Messenger). But there is an easy workaround:a. Rename the file ""IcePick.exe"" in the installed camera programs folder (usually, ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft LifeCam"") to something else.b. Create an EMPTY file (size 0 bytes) named ""IcePick.exe"" (for example, right-click on that folder's right pane in Windows Explorer, create a new empty text file and DON'T open it; then rename it and confirm that you want to change the extension).Step (a) disables the button already, but if you don't perform step (b), when you access the camera utility ""Properties"" window (to change exposure, brightness, etc.) the driver will reinstall itself (asking for the CD, etc.) and restore the original ""IcePick.exe"" undoing what you did. But after performing both steps, the button is dead. If you want to restore the functionality, just delete the empty ""IcePick.exe"" and rename the old file back to its original name.2) When lighting conditions change too suddenly (for example, when a brightly lit arm comes quickly closer to the camera) it may reset the feed and go dark for a second or two while the driver adjusts itself. Sometimes this can be annoying, and I don't know if there is a way to tweak the driver so that it doesn't adjust itself so often.Other than these two points, however, the VX-6000 one of the best webcams I have ever seen and I don't hesitate to recommend it. No camera is perfect and other models and brands certainly have their down sides, too. The ones I've found are tolerable, and pale in comparison with this product's excellent quality.A final tip: the driver on the CD is almost certainly outdated. [...]"
3199,"Gorillapod does it again.  Works very well and is well built.I use it to hold either a small point and shoot or my phone.In a couple of months of use, it has shown no signs of loosening.Suggestion:  Play it safe, don't buy the knock-offs of these."
3200,"If you're hesitating, hesitate no longer and buy this lens.  It is a major upgrade from the Canon factory zoom lens.  At 2.8 and the short focal length, stabilization is unnecessary (Tamron calls it VC and Sigma calls it OS).  I had considered buying the Tamron version with VC or the Sigmas with HSM and OS, but after playing around with a copy of each I found it wasn't worth the upgrade.  The auto focus is louder than my USM L lenses, but it's plenty fast and sharp.  This lens is a real gem for the price.  With the money saved I'll be able to purchase a Canon 70-200L f/4 IS lens.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the auto focus motor is slightly louder than my USM Canon's and not quite as fast in some conditions, but it's far from being a clunky R2D2.  I have no issues with the location, operation, and feel of the zoom and focus rings."
3201,"Guys. You're buying a three piece charging set for 5 bucks. What do you expect? The important thing is that it works, which mine does. I wanted a backup set to take to work with me and it's been almost a year and everything is still working fine. It's definitely cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. It's not like you're looking at this product and reading the reviews because you want the nicest possible charger. I will say that I love the retractable USB cable that comes with it. I hate when cords are laying around and this is a great solution. I keep the cord in the center console of my work car and this one stays wrapped up and out of the way. Is it the greatest one you can buy? Nope. But it does the job and is very inexpensive, and for that I recommend it."
3202,"I've been using Logitech mice for years because I have large hands and LOVE the ergonomics of it.  Also, I use only corded mice because I'm on my laptop almost all the time and lose the mouse if it's not attached ... (I know, I know...)The reliability is so bad that I have taken to buying 4 at a time and just tossing when one goes bad, it happens that often.  Am on my computer all day so it does get a workout, but it's not unusual to have to replace in 6 months.  I don't mess with warranties but figured I should have a box in the corner of my office and one day ship all my dead mice back to Logitech and see what happens.But - I really do love the mouse and it's worth the replacement cost to me - nothing else comes close."
3203,"Overall I aagree with the comments on picture quality and overall satisfaction with the unit.  One area of annoyance is the constant background noise created from the fan.  I have my unit in a large wood open cabinet so the fan noise is a little louder than normal.The other item is the wide difference in picture quality between various materials, such as off-air HDTV, DirectTV (no HDTV) and my DVD player.  These difference I do not believe to be unique with this TV, but is the reality of the different qualities of input signals.  I find that the set allows me  to quickly tune the color and picture qulity in with its various preset picture settings, such as a dark or very bright room.I am using an Oppo up-converting DVD player and the newer software titles have almost as good a picture as an off-air live 1080 show, such as a football game."
3204,"Taiyo-Yuden is made in Japan with the same care and quality of a Honda or Lexus. They are also one of the first producers of digital-optical discs, and it shows.The compatibility of this media has been perfect! I have bought TONS of blank-media over the years and I have always been used to the fact that some of the media will be flawed or will have recording errors. I throw the disc away and cross my fingers hoping the next disc will be okay. Sometimes, a different brand disc will work fine on all my equipment, but not on a friends. Again, with Taiyo-Yuden, this has never been the case. T.Y. discs have ALWAYS worked on any equipment my friends, family, or myself have ever tried them in.I have NEVER had flawed discs or recordings on Taiyo-Yuden products. And if you can sacrifice the silk-screened label showing off the brand name and allowing you to label your discs in a perfectly straight manner (I do admit this is one of the reasons the product received only four stars, I guess I am just an O.C.D.-case perfectionist and a show-off), MAKE THIS BRAND ONE OF YOUR FIRST CHOICES! The cost of this unbranded media saves you money and gives you more value. Ironically, this makes it one of the CHEAPEST choices as well.As far as a difference you can see: the video-quality of these discs in high-end DVD players is very good!BUY THE BEST AND SPEND LESS THAN AVERAGE? Sounds like a great value to me. And the price is even for the Premium Line!ADDITIONAL REVIEW INFORMATION!I DO need to point out that when I started buying the ""JVC"" labeled Taiyo-Yuden media, I started to have some problems. The first JVC labeled spindle of T.Y. DVD-R media had FIVE discs that did not burn correctly (the second, THREE)! I DO tend to be a bit of a perfectionist (trust me, NOT in a good way), and five out of a hundred is only one bad of twenty, but I have never had five discs out of a 100-disc spindle go bad from ANY manufacturer. I have only used two-hundred JVC labeled Taiyo-Yudens and EIGHT were bad, this is the worst record of any manufacturer I have used with the exception of TDK. Admittedly, I only had a few bad TDK discs in my history, but my new computer rarely even recognizes there is a blank TDK disc in the drive; and when it does, the recordings ALWAYS fail, EVERY TIME.  The JVC/Taiyo-Yudens that failed, failed on this same computer (however, NONE of the Taiyo-Yuden-ONLY discs EVER failed on this computer).My friends have also told me five of one-hundred is very lucky compared to their experiences and I burn HUNDREDS of discs a year compared to them so I still recommend Taiyo-Yuden more than any other brand (MAM-A/Mitsui is trusted as the finest-quality blank-media on the market, but until the JVC/T.Y.s, I had more discs fail by MAM-A than T.Y. Also, they are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive, I DO use MAM-A for the most important recordings of music, video, and important digital data). Because Taiyo-Yudens cost much less than MAM-A/Mitsui, go with T.Y. first. If you wish to record audiophile-quality music for audiophile-quality equipment, or back-up live performances or family videos, spend the extra money on MAM-A/Mitsui, but for general everyday use, ONLY use Taiyo-Yuden!"
3205,"Hello I purchased this item about 4 months ago and gave it to my wife for her birthday. About 10 days ago they stopped working and I was going nuts. Luckily the motorola rzor charger fits so I was able to charge it and so I figured it was the power adaptor that was broken. I went to Logitech's web page (at he time their online system was not working) so I called them and ordered a replacement for $10 + $5.95 which is very reasonable. I am waiting for the plug but I'm very happy that I was able to get my replacement for a very reasonable price. About the speakers they are very nice, not too loud, but enough, the sound is very good and the rechargeable batteries are a nice add on"
3206,"They isolate well, and do indeed narrow the soundstage of my se110s. Unfortunately, they look very strange and reach into parts of my ear that I was not aware existed. Not exactly uncomfortable, just unusual. I'm going to stick to the foam tips for now, but when they wear out, these will do."
3207,Item was just as advertised and fit perfectly. Excellent value as it was about 1/3 to 1/4 the price of the Garmin replacement.
3208,"We've used this for about a month and it mostly works fine. It handles our Sony Bravia TV and Comcast cable box quite well, down to the elaborate menu multi-way rocker button. But we've yet to get it to emulate our Sony BluRay controller, and Sony's on-line support was of no help.The manual is terse but clear enough if you read it very carefully. Still haven't tackled programming the multi-function buttons."
3209,"The tripod arrived on time, packed very securely in bubble wrap.  It functions perfectly but may be a bit light when exteneded fully.  But at the price it's going for it's worht every penny.  The carrying bag looks professionally too."
3210,I got this as an additional subwoofer to my 7.2 system.  It bottoms out so you cannot turn it up too loud for deep bass but it adds good dimension.  I am happy with it especially for the price.  Obviously you cannot expect top notch audio at entry level price.  I would certainly recommend this product.  It has nice controls built on and looks pretty good too.  It's also not very large for the space conscious.
3211,"I purchased this monitor to replace my 17"" NEC.  So far I have been very happy with it.  I am using the DVI connector with my ATI Radeon XL1800 video card.  It is working great with no dead pixels out of the box and nice clarity and brightness."
3212,"I purchased this drive to replace a failing external LaCie 250GB drive.So far so good, the drive works well, silent and fast.I just had a hard time getting it online. Actually, the installation manual was not very helpful.I had to use the F2 setup screen to enable the 2nd internal hard drive. It was disabled as a factory default and nothing in the manual nor on WD web site was pointing in that so simple setting problem.BTY, WD web site has only 10 FAQ and the customer support is open only during US business hours, so for me, it is hard, I can do this only after business hours. I am working you know.Once over it, everything went smooth, The initialization phase was surprisingly fast for such large drive (set up as slave).I still give it a good price quality ratio. If I go installing internal stuff, I have to be kind of a geek."
3213,"Toshiba PA3399U-2BRS Battery (Equivalent)works fine, inexpensive compared to name brands...worth buying as a spare..I don't have any more praises.."
3214,"It takes quite a bit to break it, but the speaker attachment works well. There is very little or no base, but you get what you pay for. If you want better quality that this, buy a dock station for your car or a radio that comes with the dock station. This is the most basic speaker system to use with the IPOD."
3215,"The computer experts say that the question is not whether a disk drive will fail but when.  I've generally heeded these warnings and have an internal Raid 1 array on my desktop computer and archive files to Maxtor One Touch 300 GB external drives with a backup to DVD.  The weak link in my system was the digital photographs that I captured while on the road.  I downloaded them to my laptop but there was no backup until I got home.  This mini-drive seemed like an ideal situation.  It was small (5 x 3.5 x .75 inches) and had more capacity then my laptop drive.The drive is truly plug and play.  Hook it up to the USB slot and it self-loads its software to the computer, although you will have to go through the usual wizard.  If you want, you can set up automatic backups and encryption, although I did not test this feature.  The drive derives its power from the USB socket, but hooking up to just one USB port left a very low powered drive that took 12 minutes to copy 15 raw files.  The manufacturer provides a special ""Y"" USB cord in case the use of a single slot doesn't provide enough power, but unfortunately the cord was too short to reach both of the USB slots on my IBM Think Pad.  Luckily, I had an USB extension cord on hand and with the drive hooked up to both USB ports the files were copied to the Maxtor drive in 38 seconds.  Maxtor also sells a separate power supply if that is necessary.The drive is not armored in any way, but since I only expect to use it to back up my photo files at the end of a day, when I'm back in my hotel room, it isn't a problem for me.  It also runs at only 5400 rpm's, but for the limited purpose for which I need it, that's fine.Note:  When I bought this external drive I was using it to back up a laptop that had two USB ports.  I recently purchased an image tank that had only one USB port for backup.  This was not adequate to power the Maxtor drive.  I ordered the Maxtor power supply which was on back order, and has now been on backorder for more than two months.  If you do not have more than one USB port available, you should not buy this drive unless you first determine that a separate power supply is available."
3216,The ability to see the individual wires pass through the RJ45 connector is more helpful that you might think.  It really does take the guesswork out of crimping the end of a patch cable.  With a standard RJ45 connectors I occasionally had to cut off an end if I wasn't certain the wires were in the right sequence or were pushed far enough forward.  The stress relief boots are also nice - they add some stability and also give the cable a more finished look.
3217,"I use this as a part of my left-right television system.  It works great on music and movies alike.  I had a phasing issue which I was able to resolve with plugging it mono, but I wish it had a phase reverse function.  I also wish it had an auto-on sensing feature so I don't have to keep it on all the time."
3218,"Headphones are headphones to me.  I can't usually tell the difference in sound between expensive & cheap, but for the life of me I can't keep most earphones in my ear.  I've tried over the ear clips, and a half dozen pair that promise to conform to the inside of the ear for a super tight fit.  They all fall our when I run or even sweat a little.  I saw a lot of people complain bout soreness after wearing these for a while.  There is a little getting used to with any new piece of equipment. I would recommend playing with the different sizes to get one that keeps the phones in your ear without hurting."
3219,"The pop-up shade works great in blocking out light from the top and sides.Pro-You can see the screen without the glare.Con-The mechanism can be damaged, when sliding the camera in and out of a snug camera case. The plastic detents are damaged that hold the pop-up portion to the camera frame (part of the Delkin)"
3220,"I own several cheaper models of noise canceling headphones, so I am well equipped to do comparison.As everyone has stated, the headphones are very comfortable, have good battery life and excellent sound quality. As the matter of fact, these are the first headphones I tried that can reproduce Alicia Keys music without distortions with my iPod's equalizer set to ""Rock"".Noise canceling is the most efficient among all headphones I have ever seen. Even in the loud train, they create quiet environment.Sound quality is worse when noise canceling off, but it is still tolerable.One major problem (at least with my particular unit) is relatively loud hiss. When you listen to the music in a loud place (like train or plane), this doesn't matter because this hiss will be masked by remaining ambient noise. However you don't want to use these headphones for music in the quiet home. The only way to avoid the hiss will be to turn off the power, which as I stated above, lowers the sound quality.Here is the bottom line.These headphones are excellent solution for noisy environments (for which they are of course primarily intended). Because of the hiss, they are not so good for music listening in the quiet places despite very good sound quality.Update 12/11/07.I have tried another pair of these phones and the level of hiss noise was identical to the first pair. So now I am sure that I didn't deal with a random fluctuation; they all are likely to be as described in my review above.Update 08/07/2008.I used these phones on a plane during a very long flight. Excellent experience. I wore them during the entire duration of the flight and didn't get tired. Listened to my iPod for some time, just used them for noise protection the rest of the time, and even slept with them on my head. They worked extremely well with airplane noise."
3221,I bought this learning remote for only a few dollars more than Sony were asking for a 2nd remote for my new Blue Ray. It replaces 5 remotes that I no longer need to use. It took 8 hours to program with only one call to customer support and that was because I did not read the instructions carefully. They answered promptly and were pleasant and helpful.A few cons:  The Fast Forward and Reverse buttons should be bigger and wider. There is no record button though you can program one on the screen. The back-light is too dim and I will need to use it a lot until I get used to the button layout by touch. It should be possible to edit or delete main menu items but it is not. The punch-thru feature is over-complicated and it is not a true RF remote. It will not operate ceiling fans and components operated by RF only. So I still have 2 remotes I cannot get rid of.All that aside it is a good product for the price and I recommend it.
3222,"I purchased these cause my ""stock"" ipod earbuds actup at times.  I have had the stock ones for several years now.  These Coby CVE92 sit in my ear differently yet comfortably.  The sound quality is really good especially since you aren't spending a fortune on these.  I think I spent under $10 for these.  Delivery was about 5-8 business days.  I don't need these to sound like Boss earbuds, just something to listen to my ipod while at gym and that cancels out the gym noise enough to enjoy my workouts.  Great buy."
3223,"It takes some figuring out and practice putting on, but it does its job nicely, holding the camera snugly enough against your chest, allowing hands to be free, and your mind to be worry free about the camera swinging out or away and bonking things.  At the price, it was a no-brainer.  One oddity:  If shooting through the view finder, no problem.  If instead using an LCD view screen, especially one of the flexible positioning ones, the left arm needs to be slipped out of its strap to allow sufficient viewing space away from the face.  If worn with only the right shoulder strap on, the camera is still adequately secured, but more to the side, with a bit more play in its movement.  Note:  I used the strap for several hours with a Nikon D5100 DLSR with a standard 18-55mm lens and was quite happy with it."
3224,easy paint on brush which I love.professional coolingI have used this for years.
3225,"My neighborhood has started having some issues lately and I had considered installing a monitored alarm system. I checked out the cost and I really didn't want to pay it. I found these here at Company A after doing an internet search for door alarms and couldn't believe it would do what the packaging said (for only 12-14 dollars a piece!). After they arrived (batteries came with them!), I stuck one on the back door and one on the front. They work great. I have had them for over 3 months now and feel very secure. I have not had to replace the batteries yet either. I don't know what these other reviewers are complaining about. Could be operator error in the placement of the sensor? I would give the product 5 stars but it was a bit confusing at first where I was supposed to put the smaller sensor. I just now purchased 2 more for my daughter's new apartment."
3226,"Very nice desktop combo.  Keyboard has pretty good feel.  I don't like the layout of the pg keys, insert, and delete.  Overall a very nice product."
3227,"You have to have UPS for some computers. This one does the job, We keep a server up with this unit on a dedicated basis. Nice thing is there are 2 rows of plugs on back, one is UPS and the other just surge protection. Monitor goes Surge, while processor is UPS. But this is a nice compact Brand Name unit. I feel secure."
3228,"I typically shoot with digital SLRs and wanted a decent point and shoot that was small, cheap, and had decent image quality.  This camera is small, cheap, and has... good enough image quality.  It's touted as having great low-light capabilities, but the quality at ISO 1600 and ISO 2000 is crap.  Other than that, it suffers from the same problems that just about every camera in this class does: very little manual control, no RAW, etc.Don't get me wrong: I really like this camera.  I think I just have a chip on my shoulder about the state of the point and shoot market.  If you want a point and shoot, this is a very good one.  If you pre-focus, the shutter is remarkably responsive.  The video quality is pretty good.  While ISO 1600 may be noisy, ISO 400 is better than most P&S; cams."
3229,"The camera works great.  I chose this one due to the lens quality and larger numerical aperture than other small cameras.  The photos are bright, sharp, and high quality.  The camera is easy to use, but allows manual adjustment.  I'm still getting use to using a screen rather than a view finder.  The screen is bright enough, but tough to see things like a person's expression.  DO NOT BUY THE CAMERA CASE BY PANASONIC.  The case is a horrible design."
3230,"I have had mine for over five years with only one issue.Pros;1. Single cable from control box to antenna (but see below),2. Three digit readout of antenna position due to feedback from a 'hall' sensor in the rotor, not a guess as with dual motorized rotors (the same motor in the control box & rotor),3. Remote control of position,4. Conventional rotor housing design (Channel Master),5. Integrated control box with internal power supply. No separate wall 'brick'. Control box won't get pulled off the table as with the Channel Master newer small box,6. Quite operation, no motor noise from control box since position feedback is electronic, not mechanical,7. Unlike most other rotors, you can go past 360 degrees instead of reversing direction 360 degrees for compass positions between North and North East,8. Ability to 'recalibrate' position from remote; rotates rotor from 0 degrees to 360 and returns to 0 degrees (north). But see below,Cons;1. More costly compared to run of the mill, no name conventional designed rotors,2. Additional loss if you use the one cable approach (see below),3. With antennas for most TV markets, this will be adequate, but I wouldn't use this for a tri-band antenna (low/high band VHF and UHF combo) conventional design with this rotor,4. Control box is always powered, 'Off' only turns off the display. I installed a on/off switch to the side of the control box, turning it off when I'm not using it (which is 99% of the time),5. There were issues a few years ago with the bolts holding the internal plate holding the motor and shaft in place working loose over time. I believe this has been addressed,6. Constant 'fine tuning' antenna position will cause the readout to go out of calibration somewhat sooner, but not as bad as the 'old school' design (this isn't a $400 amateur radio positioner),7. Somewhat minor, the count (position) readout on the control unit will advance quicker than the rotor turns. IOW's it arrive at whatever you entered in and then flash until the rotor catchesup. What you don't want to do is enter in a different position until it stops flashing indicating the movement stopped. I brought this up years ago, the engineer I spoke to wasn't fully aware of this and would look into it. ASAIK, it wasn't addressed.DiSEqC 1.2 is the protocol that satellite dishes (antennas) positioners have used for years to indicate the exact position of the antenna. While not as critical for OTA TV signals, this is a welcome addition.The problem with all of the 'run of the mill' TV rotors is what is shown on the control box is not always where the antenna is pointing due to constantly using the rotor. The rotor 'slips' and can be off 10 or 20 degrees which can make a difference especially with narrow beamwidth antennas.The control box has three digit readout showing degrees with north being zero. Convenience comes at a price. There is around a 3db total drop in signal if you use the intended method of powering the rotor due to loss through the control box and the rotor. This may not be a issue, but if you 'on the cliff' (frequent loss of signal) with same stations, this will make it worse. What I did was to make a 'jumper' out of 18 gauge cable (zip cord is fine, this is low voltage) with F fittings on a short piece of RG59 (or RG6) cable on each end soldered to the two conductor cable. Run the antenna cable as usual, then run this power feed from the control box to the rotor protecting the unused connector on the rotor with ""CoaxSeal"" or equivalent.Lastly, this can power a in line pre-amp, but I have reservations going this route. I just don't like line powered devices, especially RF related For every active or passive device device that is placed 'in line' there is always either a loss or some other issue. I didn't include this as a ""pro' since I wouldn't consider doing this.There is a dedicated thread for this rotor over at AVScience forums. Search for ""Eagle Aspen ROTO100""."
3231,"I bought this product principally to serve as the home for my music and a backup for my data files. I use the Logitech Duet, my laptop and a PS3 to access the music with varying success.Setup is fairly simple for the basics but when you have to get the additional features working, be prepared to get down and dirty, not just with the nas, but with your other equipment. I use a Linksys WRT54G wireless router and had to upgrade the firmware on it to get decent performance from the uPnP server. Before that, I got numerous dropouts while playing music on my PS3. Once I got the router, PS3 and DNS-323 upgraded to the latest firmware, the problem was solved.Having said that, the uPnp server software isn't the best and if that is critical to you, you may want to consider alternative software like twonkyvision which seems highly rated for this application.I had problems getting the ftp server setup - mainly because there are no proper instructions included to tell you how to configure your router (or in my case my dsl modem which handles dhcp for my network). In addition, you cannot create a user profile with differing access levels to different folders on the nas. I had to use separate user setups to deal with that. Not a dealbreaker for me but your mileage may vary.The iTunes server is bare bones and I disabled it, mapped the nas to a drive and pointed my iTunes library to it. It slowed the loading of the library somewhat but caused no problems whatsoever.I installed Slimserver on the nas using funplug and aside from some problems scrolling through the entire listing of artists (my music collection is over 12,000 songs), it works well. Searches are fast and there are no skips when music is playing.Overall, a good product but not for the faint of heart. Understand that a network is a dynamic organism with interelated parts. In my case, the poor PS3 performance had more to do with the dated firmware of the router not properly supporting uPnp rather than nas problems. The DNS-323 is not perfect, but it is reasonably fast, very hackable, has a lot of software available for it and (for me) runs quiet and cool in my home office.In the words of one of my favourite authors - Recommended."
3232,"This is my third KVM switch for using a single keyboard and monitor for two or more computers. So far I am using two keyboards, but I may still get it down to a single keyboard, The monitor, as usual, works flawlessly. My first & 3rd were D_Link. I am staying with that brand. My second was to combine four computers by an off-brand manufacturer, which worked fairly well for only two months; then it expired.  Stay with name brands and this does not seem to happen."
3233,"This is an almost perfect solution for networking computers in a large (or really any size) house (or building).  No need to run wires.  No need for a complicated wireless setup with its vulnerabilities.  If you are on the same electrical circuit - you are on the same network.Our set up is for sharing dsl internet access.  The two computers are approximately 100 feet apart on different levels of the house with many walls in between.  Having had limited success with wireless in similar situations in the past I was seeking another option and I have found it.  Used in combination with a d-link broadband router, both computers access the internet with no noticeable speed difference.ONE DRAWBACK:The only issue we have discovered is a problem with some (not all) touch lamps on the same circuit.  Our solution was to replace the lamp."
3234,"I bought the HD1A because I wanted to shoot High Def video.  The video this camera shoots is definitely better than SD video, but it doesn't look like broadcast HDTV either.  Without being able to show you the difference the best way to describe it is that the HD1A produces small amounts of video ""noise"" and the less ambient light there is, the worse this problem gets.  The problem, however isn't severe enough to make this a three star camera.  I am very pleased with the performance of the HD1A and I'm sure you will be too.  If you want to reproduce the crystal clear, sharp images you are used to on HBO HD, you will need to spend at least $3000.00 on a pro-sumer level camcorder.  This camcorder for the size and price does an amazing job!"
3235,"I bought this telescope for my 10-year old daughter for the following reasons:-the built-in database allows us to quickly find objects in the sky. Beginners can't get past this step easily!-reasonably priced and not too difficult to transport.-allows some accessories to be added: lenses, camera.-spend quality time together while learning about the sky and related physics/math. This was my long term plan.-do some astrophotography.-ability to see terestrial objects.In practice it works well and you get a lot for your money, but you will want to buy additional eyepieces.After some use you will find these unexpected limitations:-Celestron may not ship certain items to your country. If you lack the imagination to circumvent that then you may be expected to pay a huge surcharge to obtain them locally.-The gearbox teeth are too coarse for photography. You can see the tracking error when in synch mode (the object jumps in the objective).-The hand control does not have a real-time clock. This makes setting up painful and I often experience alignment failure.-Poor alignment when selecting an object. The telescope is a degree off. How is this possible?-You need a much bigger aperture than 4-inches for astronomy. Save up and start with 8 - 10 inches.-Battery power from on-board batteries is too low. Use with external power.-Finder scope should automatically power off after a few minutes otherwise the kids will leave it switched on an the watch battery will die.-The communication protocol to the device is rather poor. I suspect it was designed by a astronomer instead of an engineer.-The telescope came with some fibre in the tube. Quality control not as good as I expected.I am a beginner and still need to try the wedge and begin my walk in astronomy. The problem with astronomy is that the results are dependent on the sum of all the parts e.g. you won't get good photos with a cheap mount. Rather buy the items that will last a lifetime to start with and add to your collection as you can afford. I am looking at buying a 10-inch Meade instead now."
3236,"I purchased these batteries for me and a friend, seems to be as good as oem, will see in the long run."
3237,"This product is a necessary evil.  Seems expensive, but when you lose one... I guess you have to suck it up.  Easy to install."
3238,"I've only had this a couple days, but have already taken quite a few pics and videos with it so I think I can give a reasonably accurate review. Although the camera isn't perfect (at this price level, what do you expect, pay $1000 for a digital SLR if you want to try for absolute perfection), for what you pay it is awesome. First and most important, in my opinion the picture quality is really really great. I like my pictures to be very sharp and good color and for most pictures this camera delivers --- my benchmark of quality is my old HP 945 whose pictures I loved but it broke, and this camera's pics are as good as the ones I got from that one (read my review of the HP 945 if you're curious). Other cameras I've had or tried include the Casio EX-Z120 and Kodak C743. This camera blows away the C743 in all areas, and for such a small price difference (maybe $30-$50) I would just get this one. The picture quality of this one is definitely better than the Casio EX-Z120, but the Casio is a bit better low-light performer (it can go up to ISO 1600, whereas this one only goes to 800; the Casio also seems to focus a bit better in low light, but the focusing performance of this one in low light is definitely acceptable). So by the most important measure, picture quality, I love this camera and definitely recommend it. The 5X optical zoom is great too (and you can even use it while filming video!), a nice addition above the usual 3X zoom, although you'll need a steady hand or tripod at large zooms (no image stabilization in this camera). Some others have complained about the flash performance of this camera, e.g. that it isn't good, the pictures are dark or washed out, etc. I have found this to be somewhat true, but the key is to use the in-camera ""Perfect Touch Technology"" which corrects this very well I have found. Finally, the video quality is really good too: as I said, you can use optical zoom during video (although it gets out of focus for a brief instant while zooming before focusing well again), but also it stores videos in MPEG4 which is very space efficient (other cameras, e.g. the Casio EX-Z120, use Motion JPEG which is a real space hog), it is 30 frames per sec VGA (i.e. real-time motion, TV quality), and finally the low-light performance is pretty good (e.g. cheaper cameras such as the Kodak C743 are HORRIBLE in low light, almost completely dark and barely discernible, while this one is much better and nice); it is not as good as a dedicated camcorder, but if you are on a budget (i.e. don't want to purchase 2 separate products) and/or you value the convenience and space savings of just carrying one camera then this can probably work well as your video camera too. In sum, a great camera and especially so at its price. It would have been nice to have optical image stabilization, but that probably would have jacked the price up quite a bit and I can personally live without it. Highly recommended."
3239,"Great little camera.  This is my third digital camera and my first Canon digital.The image stabilization feature is what sold it for us.  We purchased this as a replacement for our stolen Sony DCP-100.  We liked that camera a lot and looked to Sony for a replacement.  But after reading reviews and handling the Sony's we weren't impressed at all.In looking back at the photos we had taken with the Sony we realized how many of them were blurry.  So we went with the Canon as it was one of the only cameras in our price range that had Image Stabilization.  We have already noticed a difference in our picture quality. IS is an excellent feature for a camera this small as the slightest movement of your hands passes directly to the camera.Battery life seems good so far but we haven't really stressed it yet.All of the hatches for the various compartments seem a little too delicate for my liking, but I thought the same thing about the Sony and it never failed.I don't like the fact that I have to remove the battery from the camera to charge it.  thats a lot of moving seemingly delicate parts just to charge the battery.  Why can't it charge through the USB cable?The other issue I have with the camera is the finish of the front of the camera.  It is VERY delicate and scratches VERY easily.  I suggest buying a case for this camera ASAP.  I delayed purchasing a case and now have scratches on mine.  Our previous Sony had scratches too but only after two years of use and still weren't as noticeable as these after just two days.Overall we are very happy with this camera.  The menu is easy to use and set up for your preferences.  The big 2.5"" screen is bright and works well even in bright sunshine.  The buttons have a very solid quality feel.It takes better pictures than the Sony it replaced and we were very happy with that.  The macro mode could be better as it doesn't allow me to get as close to a subject as I would like but that inst a deal killer as I don't shoot that many macro images.Overall a great point and shoot camera that anyone should be happy with...from first timers to professionals just looking for a pocket point and shoot to carry around.  But then again it should be for $400.  There are better values in this category (i.e. Panasonic) but this one had the best mix of features and quality for our needs and wants.PROS:Small sizeImage StabilizationLCD displayFast start up and easy to useCONS:Delicate hatch coversMust remove battery to chargeDelicate front surface finish scratches easily"
3240,"This is my third canon camera, and my favorite. I decided on this older model because of the wide angle lens. It really helps to fit everything in for a group shot or large subject (house) shot. You will notice some barrel distortion (curving of image around edges) if your subject has long, straight lines (bridge or rooftop) and fills the frame. That's just how a wide angle works. You won't notice it at all if you are taking shots of friends/family.Pros: Small, Light, fast response time & great picsCons: When pointed close or directly at sun or extremely bright object, the screen will show green and black patches. The picture will be fine though."
3241,"I wanted to be able to turn on/off two exhaust fans in my attic without having to pull down the stairs and climbing up and down to accomplish this.  I have a 90 year old house with thick plaster walls and cielings.  This device, plugged into the attic receptacle with a duplex extension cord enabled me to turn on those fans from my upper floor. It works the first time you press the remote's on and off buttons without fail.  I use the remote far closer than 100 feet but the fact that it works through a thick plater cieling satisfied my requirement."
3242,"This set has a good signal. I set a few of these up in our offices, where the keyboard sat below the desk on a keyboard extension tray and the signal was still good. I set some receivers hidden behind the monitors and the mouse and keyboard still operated well. The only drawback is that there are not illuminated Nums, Caps, Scroll lock buttons on the keyboard itself. It is actually built into the included software. However, the mouse and keyboard will operate without the software. So unless, you need the locks alerts and some button programming features, I wouldn't recommend installing the software. It's just another thing that you'll have to wait to load while starting up Windows. It takes about 15 seconds extra to load on a 2GHz Duo Core with 2GB RAM."
3243,WE WERE KIND OF WORIED GETTING THIS BECAUSE OF THE REVUES SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO BIG FOR THE WD PASSPORT DRIVES. IT'S A LITTLE LOOSE IN THERE BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO BE A PROBLEM. IT DOES A GOOD JOB AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING PROTECTIVE TO KEEP IT IN. I'D RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT IT. THE EXTRA ROOM GIVES YOU A GOOD PLACE TO PUT THE CABLE.
3244,"but you can probably find a cheaper product that will work just as well. Monster Cable is notorious for over-charging for its products, as most people know."
3245,Does what it is supposed to. Adds a bit more weight but not terrible IMHO
3246,"I have this hooked to a TCL 43"" LCD TV. It's not perfect at getting signal indoors (i have it set behind my TV in my second floor apartment). The signals, when I find the ones I want by adjusting a bit, come through clear and the HD ones are very nice. Overall I'd buy it again at this price."
3247,"great deal for the price,seller is good,was packed well and shipping was fast,ok quality,only problem,who measured holding strap inside?(too big)but can be adjusted,all over good deal for the price,fits nice my HP Pavilion DV7 17.3 in!also has extra  space for all my accessories,great for travel,customs can see thru small pockets so you don't have take all small things out,works for me!"
3248,"I got a projector for showing videos in my room and at first used canvas. That really didn't work out since canvas didn't fall perfectly straight. This screen is great and folds up and can be stored under a bed or in a corner or large closet. If you are hoping you can travel with this, please be advised that this is heavy... it's about 40 pounds and is a pain to lug around. Also, I would not use it for outdoors. Still, it's ideal for presentations in hotels and is something that your crew can lug around. I gave this a 4 star review in the hopes that they come out with a super light-weight titanium one. Sure it'll cost 5x as much, but oh boy presentations that are out of reach are now possible."
3249,"everyone seems to encounter the same problem.  Not enough room for larger power supplies.  If your machine only requires a 400 or 500 watt PSU, you problably have no use for liquid cooling.  I am using the Thermaltake 750 toughpower, and it barely fits.  Unable to use the support brace they included.  However, it doesn't seem to be necessary so i'm not using.  Haven't finished the machine yet, but everything else is ok.  Lots of room, lots of fans.  I like it!"
3250,"This review's sole purpose is to confirm that the mouse ships with with the keyboard. I ordered the item here on Company A, and the seller was [...]. I initially thought that only the keyboard had come, but discovered that, in order to get to the mouse, you had to open the other side of the box, where a small compartment there houses the mouse.The keyboard and mouse themselves are basic (OK for spare keyboard)- but they fill their purpose satisfactorily."
3251,This turned out to be a great and cheaper alternative to those other speakers that cost lots more.  The sound is great and very clear.
3252,ITS OK....I USED THEM TO EXTEND MY SPEAKER SEPERATION...MUCH NEEDED LENGTH ....I MEAN THEY R  JUST R.C.A. CABLES ...WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?? WORKS 4 ME
3253,"I compared this and the Nikon D40.  Glad I got this one.  Easy to use, lightweight, does everything a $1500 camera will do, except shoot fast on continuous.  Great shots, nice and clear, not a ton of distortion on higher ISOs.  The kit lens, although not horrible for landscapes and tight portraits, you'll want something else for low light, and action.  I recommend getting the kit lens for the D40, 28-135 USM IS, very nice and once you put that on, the XTi is a brand new camera.  I've heard of problems with shooting on continuous with flash.  Don't use the flash, I don't even know why they still tack these on SLRs, get a flash if you know you'll need it, you won't regret it.  Another issue is durability, of course they aren't going to make a $600 body as tough as the D40.  I recommend buying the MADE Camera Armor, nice product, helps with the durablility issue.  Right now this is a perfect camera to get me started in my studies and career.  Of course I will upgrade when I start making more money, but this is a cheap substitute and nearly as good as pro cameras.  So if you're looking for a fun little camera that packs a punch and saves your pocket book.  Get this and get the accessories, worth it."
3254,i have the tablet loaded up with movies when we have to do a road trip and now i dont have to hear all the bickering about who gets to listen to the movie.  it's been through several trips now and it's still in great shape.
3255,Delivered early by USPS. Works as expected. I needed an adapter that didn't extend too far out the back of my equipment like the one-piece versions. Appears to be good value
3256,"Well made, quality product. If you are a planner like me, you won't mind the wait, as this one shipped from China, which only took 17 days. If you need a patch cable this one is good to go. :-)"
3257,"This will have been my fifth build over the last 12 years and this case was an absolute dream to assemble with only a couple drawbacks.It speaks ""Look at me"" if you go with a blue theme it is wild to look at.As for features I liked the placement of the front ports and the top recessed tray is handy to lay little thing in.This case is basically solid construction but i found the the pull out fan drive cages are a pain to pull out.Try and put them back in often they will get jammed and not slide back into place.The fan intake filter screens clog quickly if you livein a dusty home and you will need to clean them every couple of weeks.Plus the optional 120mm fan mount on the side internaly if used will get in the way of most tall graphic cards or internal water cooler rigging. Such was my problem but i just reversed the fan mount to outside the case and installed a fan grille.It is sweet to look at in the dark but i will say it is loud like a fan running in the summer time.I still love this case."
3258,"The SpotCool fan works great and lowered my Adaptec Card 30 degrees centigrade. Was able to position and aim it directly on the dual 1.2 GHz processor on the 5085 RAID HBA. it worked great until I added cards and had to reposition it. After that the 3-way fan speed swith stopped working and the speed stayed at low. This was indadequate to keep the card at the recommended operating temps. So I returned it and purchased another. But, treat it delicately as you move it around. Otherwise, just fine."
3259,"The back of my LG wall mount tv indents a little where this plug needs to go, they do this so when you look at the back of the tv it looks more ""clean"" however the length of the plug wasnt long enough to clear this indent, im not going to return the item because of the hassle.the product itself is an alright quality, it isnt grade a but i will deff get the job done. besides if you dont abuse the connection or keep unplugging and plugging it back in im sure it will last a lifetime."
3260,"I got this player for my wife for Christmas and we love it so far.  The feature that sealed the deal for me was the line in recording and it works great.I have a small library of cassette tape sets of self-help and financial gurus (Nightingale, Gerber, etc.).  I know that recording/digitizing these tracks through my PC's sound card is possible, but the Zen is a very simple alternative.The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that it requires the Zen software to be installed on the PC to browse the contents.  This is probably because the unit is capable of synchronizing Outlook contacts.  Same thing with my Axim PDA.  Not a big deal at all though.Sounds good, sized and priced right. Highly recommended."
3261,"I used this item to mount a 22"" TV in our bathroom and it worked great. It's small and lightweight yet heavy duty enough to securely handle a small TV. I do agree with the other reviews that having a rotational adjustment would be nice. However I did ensure that it was hung level on the wall and didn't have any issues. Further there is a little play in the holes to mount the TV so you can achieve the same thing by loosening all of these screws a half of a turn and then ""rotating"" the TV to where you desire and tightening them down again. Overall it's a great product especially at this price point."
3262,"For the price, these are fantastic.  They're everything you'd expect and do everything the description explains.  The only reason I'm shooting them 4 stars and not 5 are because they can't support much weight without sagging(yes, my monitors were well within the weight restrictions).  I have two led 19inch monitors side-by-side and they do look great, but I was a little disappointed to see the amount of sag that occurred....maybe a half to a full inch depending on how far the screen is extended.  No, I did not expect the world of these when I bought them for $15, but did expect them to be a little stiffer.  Otherwise, quality and finish we're really good and were very easy to mount with the included hardware. Packaging was also very well done.  Like I said, for $15 they're a great deal and as long as you do not have older, heavier monitors then I'd have no problem recommending them."
3263,using 2 of them now for 6 months - working well easy to setup
3264,"These inexpensive speakers have their own power supply, a volume and tone knob, headphone and line out jacks.  they definitely lack the deep base quality of the 2.1 sets, but the trade off is that the left and right speakers are a little better since there is no separate bass like that on the inexpensive 2.1 offerings.  I did not want a separate bass unit, so happy with these.  Solid plastic construction."
3265,"This is my second Harmony (having owned the H688 previously), so I am already familiar with Logitech's (quite improvable) web programming system. It also is my third universal remote, so I have some experience in this regard (not all of them pleasant).First of all, the H1000 is a solid device, and it has a lot of nice touches that show that it's engineers have put their knowledge to good use. For example, the device self-activates as soon as you pick it up or move it about.The device itself looks really, really nice with it's rounded edges, brushed aluminum finish, and perfectly-placed real-button controls (if you are right-handed, which I am). It fits the palm of my hand nicely, combining just the right thickness and heft, placing the buttons naturally under my right thumb. The H1000 combines a color active-matrix LCD with is touch-sensitive (for programmable virtual buttons), and an array of real buttons along the right edge. Using the remote comes natural, with your thumb seeking out the buttons, and using the left index finger for the virtual buttons.The Harmony works by assigning 'activities' that know which devices are required, turning them on, and unneeded devices off when switching to an activity. It remembers which devices are on/off from the current activity. For example, when I switch from 'Listen to music' to 'Watch DVD', the Harmoniy gives the commands to- stop playing in iTunes to my Mac mini- turn on the DVD player- switch to 'DVD in' on the Amplifier- turn on the TV, and switch to SCART2To use this functionality you have to set up the remote first, and this is the step that most people find frustrating. Logitech provides a web interface which works, but is far from user-friendly. The database of supported devices is surprisingly large and complete, and if you can't find your device, the remote can 'learn' the relevant commands from your original remote (provided you still have it). Unfortunately, programming the remote is cumbersome, and involves many program-upload-test cycles that take a *lot* of time. Once set up, the remote works well. Provided, of course, you thought of the many times where you need more than the basic functionality, and have programmed it.The biggets problem many people may face with the remote (and this may be the reason for so many drastically diverging ratings) is that your enjoyment greatly depends on your ability to find a good button layout for your specific needs. Thus, you can either end up with the perfect remote, or a borderline usable device. Few people, however, are prepared to invest the time required to get the Harmony to a level that is really good. In this regard I would like to see Logitech to provide templates for more intelligent layout design.A nice surprise to me was the H1000's ability to re-use most of my H688's programming, cutting down my time to program it a lot. Also, contrary to many reports, the software can be used on a Mac - at least on an (older) PPC-based one. One strange choice was that Logitech chose to implement the USB adapter as a network connector (instead of a peripheral), which can cause problems. I did not encounter any crashing bugs during my set-up phase.As with most touchscreen-based remotes (this is my second remote of that kind, the other one being the venerable Sony Commander), it has the problem that you have to actually look down onto the remote while using it, and then glance back at the TV to see if the command was successfully received. Most people are used to 'feel' their way around a remote and can find the correct button blindly. While this was a big problem on my previous touch-screen remote, Logitech has added the most important buttons next to the touch screen, enabling similar behaviour (provided that you set up the remote that way). If your set-up is smart in that regard, you can use the Harmony blind for most of your needs.An annoying quirk (which I hope I can resolve soon) is that when you place the remote into the provided loading cradle (*nice*), it (falsely) assumes that you are done with all your activities, and commands all devices to power down.Also, the H1000 appears somewhat sluggishly in responding to some commands. While this is less of an issue when giving a 'play' command to the DVD player, it makes volume control somewhat more difficult than it needs to be.Other than that, I can wholeheartedly recommend this device to people, but must caution them that they should only invest in this device if they are prepared to invest the time required to fine-tune it. And the *will* take a few hous."
3266,"I had one of these that I have been using since late 2009 or early 2010 and it had a zippered pouch on the outside left side. It is not shown in one picture of the product now but in another picture it is there. When I ordered this one, I really wanted it with the zippered pouch but did not get it.The handle used to have a button that would lock/unlock allowing you to raise and lower the handle. Mine broke and that's why I had to purchase a new one. This years model does not have a button. The problem now is as long as you pull the case on the wheels, it is fine. But if you have to push it to turn it around or whatever, the handle automatically starts to collapse.Shipping to return it for repair is too much and I would be without a case for 1-2-3 weeks while they repair it. So much for a 5-year warranty.It is good and sturdy and rolls well."
3267,"The ends of these cables are attached very well, so they come loose easily. So if you plan on unplugging this often I would go with something a little higher quality. However, I bought 2 of these and ran through the wall for my XBOX and Cable so they aren&#8217;t going to be moved for a long time. That being the case, they are working just fine and have been for months."
3268,"Nice small device ideal for exercise.  I plan on replacing the neck lanyard with an alligator clip - it is small and light enough to snap onto whatever you are wearing. I expected to have to replace the stock earbuds with better units but will probably stick with these.  I like a nice punchy bass and while these don't have that brain rattling 'whump', they ain't as lame as most other stock buds.  The driver for replacment will probably be keeping them in my skull when working out.I especially like the ability to plug in 512 Meg micro flash cards ($2 each) for more capacity.  Our family has pretty esoteric tastes and listen to it all; metal, classic rock, country, bluegrass, opera, jazz, swing, disco....everything except (c)rap which we don't consider music.  Micro flash cards let you load up the genres and plug in whatever suits your fancy.  The micros are so tiny tho', they would be easy to lose and I wish someone made a case for this baby with little tiny flash card holders.Loading is fast and easy with Windows Media Player but be sure you have downloaded version 10 to ensure everything is kosher.  Ditch Midnight Jukebox if you have it - Windows loads faster and has all the same features including downloading album info online.  The only downside is the FM tuner which won't work out here in the boonies (none of the MP3s work outside metro areas).  When our gym installs in-house FM transmitters for sounds, I hope this little baby does a good job.  Highly recommended."
3269,"I have used 3-4 other FM transmitters in the past and this one works much better than any of those.  It is simple to use, locks in on a station and transmits a good signal.I would say the music is somewhat flatter than listening with headphones, but tweaking the EQ in the Sansa helps with that.Contrary to what one of the previous reviewers said, it does transmit in stereo."
3270,Bought this product for my olympus waterproof camera. Worked as expected. I would recommend this product.
3271,I bought 2 of these.  I like the size and weight of them and the fact you can mount the base to your desk. I used a mounting putty so I didn't damage the surface of the desk and that has worked well. The 2nd one I bought came with the side cap laying in the package but it was easily glued back on.
3272,The deal of the day these speakers are great to put in anything you won't have a big investment with good sound
3273,"These are simply great for the price. I was expecting tinny crap out of them, but the wallet was talking when I ordered them (and the $25 stereo) but I wanted something since my new truck didn't have a radio and had busted up speakers. I was pleasantly surprised to hear them as they have a good sound. You won't win any audio competitions with them, but they are better than most of the factory speakers I've heard (I've personally owned 38 cars and worked on vastly more) and are well worth the money. I'd buy them again and am totally happy with them."
3274,"I bought some Sennheiser wireless headphones several years ago and found the hiss intolerable, not ready for prime-time. After going through my fourth pair of Sony sports foldable headphones when wire decay reduced them to mono and having a replacement set dragged away when it got caught on a fellow bus passenger's backpack, I decided to look at wireless again. I spent a lot of time trolling the Internet and found that for headphones under $100, the Logitech Freepulse wireless were the ONLY headphones that didn't get universally HORRIBLE reviews. I read all of the reviews I could find and this set on Company A, made me take out my wallet.The one size fits all is the biggest drawback so you need to spend some time adjusting the headphones before you get an acceptable fit. No sound from the headphones? Volume is controlled by pressing the right earphone up or down, easy to set to zero volume.They sound pretty good, bright, and the dongle works with any mp3 player, TV, computer--whatever. Given the state of wireless technology, pretty horrible, it makes the FreePulse stand out.I would highly recommend them and plan to get a pair for my wife."
3275,I have two of these for my D80. They're cheaper than the Nikon battery and they seem to work just as well.
3276,"I have been using this remote for my 5D for about three years now.  I greatly prefer it to my previous remote, which was an infrared release.  I had trouble sometimes if the sun was shining on the camera or if I went too far from the camera with the infrared remote.  The radio remote allows me to move much farther from the camera, and doesn't limit the lighting situations within which  I can use the remote.The directions that came with this remote three years ago were terrible.  If they have been overhauled since then, you're lucky, because I had to pretty much figure out how to work this thing entirely on my own.  Also, don't forget to turn off the receiver, or you'll wear down the battery, and it takes an odd battery size."
3277,"Unlike what some people are complaining about, I got the item that was pictured. It also works as advertised for my LG Cosmos. There's only one problem I have with this adapter: the connection is finicky. Sometimes if I twist the plug on my phones jack, I can hear the sound go rather quiet. So, either the jack on my phone is bad or the wiring in the adapter isn't the greatest. Regardless, it was only a little over a dollar and still works pretty well so I'm not really complaining."
3278,"The Sony Rear Lens Cap is a good product, although looking it at objectively, it's nothing more than a plastic thing with the name Sony on it.The thing to keep in mind here is that this cap is necessary to protect the mount and contacts of your lenses, which this cap does in an excellent manner, since it's hard enough for the job. It's not made of easy-to-pierce through plastic.There is not much to say about it, it's good for what it does and that's that.The problem I have with Sony and other sellers is that the price for this item varies wildly and sometimes I've seen it priced at 40 dollars, which is a massive rip off for a thing that costs 10 cents to produce. There is also the issue that Sony has been cheating users lately by replacing this cap with those tiny plastic cups you use to pour ketchup in at McDonald's or Burger King on kits of camera and lens. Probably to save on costs and force you to buy one of this, but still, its ridiculous. It should be offered standard for body and lens kits as it used to be 1 year ago.Leaving that aside and focusing on the cap itself, it's good for what it does. Covers your lens' mount, contacts and rear elements, which are important parts of the lens that need to be protected when not in use. If you got Minolta lenses that require this cap, it will also fit on them."
3279,"There are many features that made this my choice to power my home theater system, which includes an xbox 360, wii, 300 watt a/v system, 46"" LCD TV, BluRay player, apple TV, subwoofer, wireless router, and cable modem.  I like how the outer 8 plugs pivot, which makes it actually doable to plug larger ac/dc coverter (block style) plugs into all 8 of the plugs.If  you, however, do not have a place to hide this surge protector, it is fairly bulky and would not look that great.I purchased this after my house was hit by lightning.  I was fortunate the only thing compromised were my ethernet ports to all of my products, but purchased this to keep anything like that from ever happening again."
3280,"I used this to connect an outlet on one end of my living room along the wall and corner to a table against another wall, hence the long cord.  So far it is working very well like I guess it should.  I have seven other surge protectors of various designs and brands and they are all working well. I particularly like this one because the on/off switch is on the side of the back and the green light is on the top."
3281,"I tried expensive cables that connect via the IPOD's headphone plug but the sound quality was poor.  These cables bypass the headphone amp in the IPOD and the result is better sound.  In terms of this particular set of cables, it is hard to get too exited.  They seem reasonably made and work.A built in charger/docking station would be better, but this is a much more cost effective solution, given the outrageous prices vendors want for cheaply made Apple ipod accessories. If you can live with the playing time being limited to the IPOD's battery life, this is the way to go.Note:  Don't expect a lot if you are playing back songs ripped at 128kb, the sound quality is really poor when compared with a CD."
3282,"I was looking for a Bluetooth keyboard with a touch pad to replace the keyboard that came with my media center PC...  but the Adesso seems a much better solution.Ergonomically, it's nicely designed with the trackball in the upper right hand corner and all the mouse buttons on the right and left corners just where you would expect them to be, and the size is just right also; smaller than a regular keyboard but a nice form factor so it works nicely if you're sitting or lying around on the couch.Not a five star product only because the pointer skips just a little here and there with the trackball... but this is still a great solution."
3283,"I selected this because I wanted to always have a Video Fluid head with me to use with my  travel tripod.  The motions are OK (I'd want something better for a studio, but all the really nice ones are too big and heavy to carry with me in my camera bag all day).The quality is good, the motion fairly smooth, the price is reasonable.  The arm detaches easily for more compact storage.  The height is a bit taller than normal (which I like, since my video tripod isn't very tall)."
3284,"I purchased this card as a replacement for a big-brand similar card that had died. The old card, like many, had a relatively noisy cooling fan which eventually after only 18 months or so ceased up and in this case apparently the chip that it was supposed to be cooling suffered permenant damage.I liked the idea of no moving fan to cease up so picked the SPARKLE after spending far too long deliberating. It uses a large metal heatsink which actually gets very hot to the touch during normal use (and I have not tried it when it is being stressed as may happen, perhaps, when playing an action game). It also remains hot even when the display is off during sleep. Good system cooling in the PC case is probably essential.The fact it is silent (without a fan) is very nice.Otherwise, the card performs as expected, seemes to be of high build quality, and produces nice images. I've had it in use for several weeks now with no sign of any problem."
3285,"This product was purchased as a package with a camera for my wife and she could not be any more happy.  This, in turn, makes me a hero for which I'm thoroughly thankful to all involved.  It does what it is advertised to do and that, in this day and age, says a lot about the product."
3286,"First of all I just want to point out that Company A.com has an EXCELLENT price on this RWIS Wireless 4-Channel Intercom system; much lower than most competitors.  At just over $90 for a pair of these intercoms, Company A makes adding this state of the art communication device easy for those of us on a tight budget.The Reporter RWIS wireless intercom system is quite an impressive two-way communicator.  It offers crystal clear reception, really long battery life, and a standard set of features that are sure to please most every consumer.  Just 4 AA batteries are claimed to power these devices for a year or better.  Just four months if left in monitor mode though.  I recommend getting a 12V power adapter for any device that you are willing to mount near an a/c outlet.  This eliminates the worry of using up the batteries and it also produces slightly better performance from the Reporter RWIS intercom system.  When just powering from batteries, the unit runs in a power conservation mode; causing some minor delays in sending and receiving audio when the talk button is pushed.  Running the unit with a power adapter completely eliminates this delay.  The intercom also features a monitor mode, so you can listen to what is going on in the room from a remote unit.  There is also a VOX mode, which produces voice activation of the Talk mode, without the need for someone to actually push the Talk button.  There are three volume levels to choose from (low, medium and high), which are toggled from the push of the volume button.  I cannot tell you if the 1,000 ft. claimed range is accurate, but I can tell you that I have four of these units placed throughout my home, some even near computer equipment, wireless routers, a 5.8 GHz cordless phone and even one near a countertop microwave oven.  They all work flawlessly, producing crystal clear vocal reception.  I really enjoy the paging feature, which allows you to broadcast a message to all of the intercom radios at the same time.OK, those are my ""Pros"" for this intercom system.  Now for the cons:The manual that comes with this system is so vague that it is sure to frustrate anyone that wishes to customize the use of their intercom system.  For example, there are two dip switches on the back of the radios.  The manual speaks of flipping one of the switches to enter ""conference mode"" but nothing is mentioned about what the other switch is for.  Having to flip a dip switch on all of the radios, any time you wish to have a conference communication between several radios, is not a very convenient option.  You also cannot simply monitor a specific room from another radio without first putting the radio of the room you wish to listen to into monitor mode.  So, if you wanted to listen in to hear if one or more of your children were playing around instead of going to sleep, you cannot call up this feature without first going into your childs room and placing the intercom in that room into monitor mode.  Kind of frustrating I think.  As others have mentioned, there is also a sometimes annoying ""beep"" every time you push the Talk button.  I realise this is looked at, by the manufacturer, as a positive feature, but during a conversation the beeping gets on your nerves a bit.  The 3-stage volume adjustment is a little lacking as well.  I find that even at the lowest setting the audio output is a bit loud at times.  Not very nice when there are people sleeping nearby when you are using this intercom.  Also, you want to make sure that you speak at natural volume with these intercoms.  Do not place your mouth extremely close to the unit or at increased volume, otherwise it produces distorted sound, sometimes accompanied by a loud popping noise.  Lastly, the manual does not specifically state how you can prevent the intercom from paging all radios in the network when you first push the talk button to call someone.  Again this is not very good if you are trying to call a particular child in one room while trying to keep things quiet for children sleeping in another room.  Although the radio lets you select a specific channel, it still seems to page all radios the first time you broadcast a message.  Once that person responds to you then only those two radios communicate between each other, leaving the other radios silent.  I would like to be able to call one specific intercom radio at times, rather than barking out a message to all radios on the network.  And what about the outside intercom radios (sold seperately)?  If you call from one of the inside intercom base radios, will your voice also be broadcast through those external devices, possibly being overheard by neighbors?  I would like to know that this will not happen before I consider purchasing the external remote intercom radios.Overall this Reporter Wireless Intercom system is a really great product.  Setup couldn't be easier.  Just insert 4 AA batteries, push the ""Learn"" button on all of the intercom radios you wish to connect to your network (all must be done within 10 seconds of each other), and within a few seconds each radio will produce a beep, which indicates that the radio(s) has been joined to the intercom network.  They are small, lightweight, easy to mount on the wall or simply sit on a counter, and it is claimed that the AA batteries will power each intercom radio for over a year, even when left on 24/7.I almost couldn't be happier with my new wireless intercom system.  Company A gave me a spectacular price and the initial setup was a breeze.  I just wish the manual was more thorough and gave details of all of the features.  I would like to purchase two more of these intercom radios; giving me a total of 6 radios on my network.  However, there is no information about how the additional units will work.  Since this is a 4-channel system, I would like to know more about adding more than 4 radios to the network.  This wireless intercom system is one of the best reviewed systems on the market today.  If only there was better documentation of its setup and use.  It could also use a few added features.  Still, this system will fit the bill for most home owners.  I am giving it 4 stars (would consider it more like 4 and 1/2 stars).  If I were rating it on sound, clarity, build quality, style/design/looks, and ease of setup, I would certainy give it 5 stars.  But with the few annoyances and lack of some fairly important and simple features, I cannot give it a perfect score.  I am very pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this system to anyone that is looking for a reliable means to communicate between two or more locations in or around your house or business."
3287,"I bought this mouse to use at work since I work on a computer 8+ hours a day and was finding my standard size/shape mouse to be giving me hand cramps. This mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic. It takes a little getting used to the bigger feel and the way its tilted off to the side but once you get used to using it, it feels great. I haven't had any hand cramps since switching to it. Also the scroll wheel is very smooth and makes no noise when moving it. It takes 2 AA batteries (that are included) and I've been using the set that came with it for about a month now for about 8 hours a day 5 days a week so battery life is pretty good if you ask me. If you are in the market for a comfortable ergonomic mouse I highly suggest getting this one. I've seen this mouse in stores for around $75 but got it here for about $35 with free shipping so I definitely recommend buying it online instead of in a store."
3288,"Portable, wearing around my neck.Video, image and music playing is great for me since I do not use GPS at all the time.Old map, 2005, they say an update will be available by dec 2008, and I will buy the update (around $80), expensive since I pay $120 for this GPS.I practice using every feature and trick on this GPS, and now love every bit of it. Fast reroute, clear voice, very responsive and fairly accurate are a few good points I can remember now.A few things I do not like, for example is you can not easily plan your trip by entering departure and destination and let it route like Micheline GPS (Micheline GPS is more accurate, tells you destination point on left or right), will not retain settings when power off completely (should have a button batt for back up), very slow locking on GPS after a long time off and too much glared.Over all, it is a fun toy for me."
3289,"The docking speaker system was deleted quickly and works as described. I am content with the quality of the sound and operation. The only letdown, the light is so bright. Even when dimmed to the lowest setting, before being completely off, it is still too bright. Other than that, highly recommended."
3290,"When I first got the unit it had a dramatically green stuck pixel.  I did apply some of the software utilities and after about 16 hours the pixel 'unstuck' and has been working fine.While the monitor is not the absolute best I've seen in LCD technology, for the money and the real estate it doesn't get any better than this.  I now watch most of my DVD's in front of my computer with this monitor as opposed to the living room.4 Stars rating due to the stuck pixel issues....almost resulted in a return.Great value purchase - go get one!"
3291,"I currently own two of these adapters and have used them in four different vehicles (Dodge Ram, Buick LeSabre, Toyota Highlander and Hyundai Santa Fe).I always install them along with a PanaVise adapter to hold our Stiletto 100.  The PanaVise adapter makes the whole installation (as long as you hide the cords) look almost as good as a factory installation (the only tricky part is to install the power plug behind the dash to hide it; if anyone needs suggestions, let me know since I've done it 4 times).  Also, the instructions from PanaVise for the installation of their product (which are also available for anyone to see and print on their website) include step by step instructions on how to dismantle the dashboard in your specific vehicle, which will make the installation of this product a breeze.The last (not always required, as other reviewers have mentioned) step is to purchase an antenna adapter for your vehicle.  You can go to AutoZone or PepBoys to find out if you'll need one, but you'll also pay more for them that way.  My personal choice is to order everything from Company A, saving money and not having to leave the house.  If you're reading this review, you know how to use the Internet well enough to find out if you'll need an adapter or not (from personal experience, if you own a GM vehicle, which includes Hyundai, you'll need an adapter and all GM adapters are the same).  At the previously mentioned locations, the adapters will run you approx $14 each, and you'll need two: one from the antenna to the Sirius Adapter, and the second from the Sirius Adapter to your factory stereo (aftermarket stereos may, or may not, need it).Now for the negative part of the review.While the adapter works great and does exactly what it is designed to do, I have one pretty important complaint about it: VOLUME!!!The FCC mandated that all Sirius and XM units decrease the power of their FM Modulators to remain within Federally mandated standards.  For this reason, newer units (newer than approx 06-07) have a very weak transmitter; which makes the volume of your Satellite Radio way lower than anything else you would listen to on your stereo.  If you like to listen to your music with the windows (or top in a convertible) down, forget about it.  This affects the wireless FM transmitter and this wired one as well.  I have yet to figure out why regulate the wired version, since it shouldn't affect any other radio stations.  The only way around this problem becomes an AUX input (if you have one, or can install an aftermarket AUX input adapter) or a tape adapter if you have a cassette player.  Neither of these will give the clean look that I like, but the sound is more important to me than the look.I hope this review helps.  Good luck with your installation."
3292,"I bought this for my Canon because I take my cameras with me hiking, walking through cities and for everyday photo shoots.  The rubberized shell protects the camera from little nicks and dings it would otherwise receive from daily use.I also like how the armor hides the Canon trademark near the horseshoe flash attachment.  The added soft hood also provides additional protection and practical usage as a sun visor for the lens and fits on all my lenses.  This way I save $$$ buying lens hoods for all my lenses.  (Each camera hood is at least $25)The armor is easy to install and doesn't hinder usage of any of the buttons on my Canon.  The armor also has a see-through visor over the LCD viewer which has already taken a few scratches.  Batteries can be replaced with no added hassles.Two complaints I have:  1) The ""armor"" attracts dust, which gives the entire armor a dirty look after a day in the field.  The dust has to be removed with a damp cloth to make the camera look presentable. 2) The rubber cover over the horseshoe flash insert presses against the built-in flash and causes a crescent dark shadow on flash photographs.  Here you have to best tuck the rubber cover over and avoid contact with the flash unit.For anyone who is as active as I am and who takes her camera everywhere she goes, and for someone who values her investment, this body armor is a necessity.  The dirty appearance is worth it to me."
3293,"Good addition to Coolpix P7000 and P7100.  Light alternative to SB-600 in larger cameras when travelling.  1/3 the size of SB-600, fits into pocket.Be careful with Sunpak flash units.  I have a Sunpak PF30XN Digital SLR Camera Dedicated i-TTL Flash for Nikon (DigiFlash) that works with my D7000 but not with my Coolpix P7000.  Sunpak does not guarantee compatibility with Nikon."
3294,"This cable doesn't have the best build quality, but it does work well.  Used it to extend my desktop to two monitors."
3295,"Very small yet solid feeling.  Nicely machined.  The only real problem with this device is the length of available threads.  Because of the excessive depth of the platform nut, there is very limited thread length available and the unit I received has even slightly less than that shown in the photos.  So look at the pictures provided carefully before purchasing as the unit no matter how solid feeling and well machined does not inspire confidence when it is being attached to expensive equipment."
3296,"Better than the cheap ones, but does not do THAT great of a job. Definitely better than having the sensor cleaned professionally if it works even once. Good to have in your camera bag in case the ultrasonic cleaner on the camera does not clean the sensor. For the price, I recommend it."
3297,"I was looking for a P&S; camera to take on vacation for those times I didn't want to lug my Canon EOS 30D around. This camera had a rave review on [...], so I purchased one. The photos are amazing - the lens is extremely sharp and the sensor in this camera is phenomenal. It really is specatacular in that regard. Dpreview compared it favorably to a Nikon D50 DSLR, and I agree that it does give a digital SLR a run for it's money. It's pretty darn close, although at full size on a computer screen you can see pixellation in some areas and some lack of detail compared to an SLR. But you have to look closely and it doesn't show in an 8x10. Fuji really did a great job with this camera, not succumbing to the megapixel race and instead concentrating on image quality. Low light shots are better than most cameras can produce. Overall, I'd give this camera top marks for image quality.I give the camera as a whole four stars because the manual controls fall short of what they should/could be. There is no mode in which you can control both shutter and aperture - it's only one or the other. In some modes the camera insists on selecting the ISO for you. You really have to do a lot of moving around inside the menus to get the settings you want, it's just very frustrating in this department. On the other hand, there are 15 scene modes (I think) that can handle most situations pretty well.But overall, considering the price of the camera, this may be asking too much. You can get all the manual controls if you spend twice as much, but I don't think you'd get better image quality - this camera is just too good at the basic task of producing great photos in most situations. I really can't get over how sharp the lens is and how beautiful the photos are. Or did I already say that?Other notes:- There is no external charger for the battery - it must be charged in the camera. Bad.- When I plug the camera into a computer, it does show up as a drive (previous reviewer said it doesn't).- No optical viewfinder. I never would use it anyway, but some people do.- The included software CD should be immediately installed in the nearest garbage can. The software is totally useless if you have any kind of editing software and know how to get pictures from one folder (the connected camera)to another (on your hard drive)."
3298,"El sondo original exclente y super compatible, ademas de ser Creative ed la vija generacion se mantiene my bien para estos nuevos sistemasThe original sound excellent and super compatible, besides being the Vija Creative ed my generation is maintained well for these new systems"
3299,"Does the job of transmitting to the radio but just don't expect high fidelity. Instead, you'll get a decent representation; call it acceptable. If you're in your car a lot, it's better than getting burned out on radio. And the charger feature alone is probably worth it, although the $60 some dollars I paid is a lot for a charger."
3300,It is slightly better than on board sound and gets the job done. Don't expect anything amazing though. Especially if you like to game.
3301,"My friend wanted to un-ghetto his widdle pioneer 10, So i ordered this for him and hooked it up. Boss usually makes some cheap shtuff, but this actually surprised me. The gain does have a really steep incline, and it's near impossible to get both channels right without a multimeter (Which I used) But If I had to get one again, I'd totally buy this. Bottom and case is plastic, however.10/10 for price and quality, 7/10 for durability.I'm still trying to get him to buy a non-stock deck."
3302,"I've long since stopped using my Garmin GPS in favor of my iPhone while in the car, so my mount is sitting under my seat, where it's been safely hiding for three years. But when I needed it, it worked great. I could just plop it on my dashboard and know that it wasn't going to fall, no matter how winding and twisty the roads were. If you still need such a mount, this is the one to get."
3303,"I ordered this product in 2011 and over a year later, the mount is still working great. The mount fits my Garmin Nuvi GPS unit perfectly and fits easily into the center compartment of recent Toyota Camry models."
3304,"All the reviews & manufacturer hype the water/dust-proofness of this camera, which is fine, because it does a great job, is easy to use, and is fairly sturdy.  However, we used to have a Canon SD400, but we wanted a waterproof camera.  This W30 is a good camera, but I think we were spoiled with the picture/lens-quality of the Canon.Good: Water/Dust proof with not much fuss.  It just works!  Easy to use. Compatible with new SDHC cards (my current card is 8GB!!!). But 16GB and 32GB are on the way.  This allows a HUGE number of photos and video to be recorded on ONE CARD.  Just make sure to keep spare batteries.  One battery will 'roughly' last about 1 hour of video and a 100-200 photos (some with/without flash).There are no external moving parts (such as lens extension)to get trapped with dust/water, since the lens 'extension' is internal.The menu/capture-speed is good, but not 'quite' as fast as Canon's Digic II cameras (like SD400, or later).USB connection is a standard USB mass-storage device, so it should work on Windows, Mac, or Linux with no problems (thank goodness).Also, this camera seems to be pretty durable/tough.  I dropped it several times on CEMENT/concrete, and it got a few cosmetic scratches on the case, but all operations and the lens were fine.  But I might put a plastic screen protector on the 2.5"" screen to prevent scratches.  Another recommendation is to get a silicon skin for pool/underwater use (to prevent case scratches from the pool/rocks), or a neoprene case to keep the lens intact while traveling (since there is NO LENS COVER).Bad:  Video uses Quicktime-MOV files, which is good (potentially), but it's a bit grainy, and the compression is not great.  But I can fit a 'rough estimate' of maybe 2-3+ hours of video on an 8GB card.Ugly: Lots of grain/noise in low-light or even some normal daylight photos.  You can workaround this by manually changing the ISO speed to 64, 100, or 200 to reduce noise, but then you may get some blurry shots (due to camera/object motion).OVERALL:  If you don't need a waterproof camera, get a Canon SD-series (they're EXCELLENT).  But if you need/want something more 'safe', get this camera.  It's easily the best water/dust-proof camera on the market."
3305,"This is great to have if you use your PS3 as a movie center, playing your blu-rays.  Much better control than trying to use the controller to control the playback."
3306,I use this with my travel computer.  I take my ACER Aspire1 with me and occasionally run into files that are still on 3.5&#34; discs.  No problem now on reading them.
3307,I absolutely love this camera. The pictures are of really good quality and its super easy to download them to my computer.
3308,"Purchased this switch to replace an old Belkin PS/2 unit. I was not sure about this switch when ordering, as many other reviewers have reported serious problems getting it to work.  But, this unit has one of the best ratings I found and I took a chance.I did have some issues getting it to work, but relatively minor ones. Of the three machines (2 Win XP, 1 Win 2003 server) I've attached to it so far they have all worked.  The 2003 Server machine loaded a couple of drivers upon logging in, but worked fine.  One of the XP machines worked perfectly (didn't even have to load any drivers).  The other XP box didn't work at all initially (no keyboard, no mouse).  I plugged in an old PS/2 keyboard (also leaving the USB plugged in through the switch).  I was able to use the PS/2 keyboard to log in once the login screen came up.  Windows then proceeded to load about 20 drivers and then both keyboards were working.  I then unplugged the PS/2 keyboard and the USB works fine.Once I got past that, the switch has worked very well.  Just a couple of minor annoyances.  I'll just list out the pros and cons:Pros:-----* No transformer to plug in. The unit is powered via the USB port, and this means there is one less boxy transformer to find a space for. Haven't had any problems with this.* The included cables are nice. The keyboard/mouse both go through a single USB port on the computer, and there is just a single plug at the switch end.* The keyboard switching works great (ScrLk, ScrLk) and switches only between active ports (ie if the computer on port 3 is not on, it will not stop at that port when switching). On my Belkin switch the key sequence was much more complicated (Ctrl-Shift-Alt, Port#, &lt;enter>).* No drivers required.  They do include a CD that has a program you can optionally install.  This allows the use of alternate key sequences to switch ports and also allows you lock the audio to a specified port.* Four separate buttons on top of the unit to switch immediately to any port.  My Belkin unit had a single button, and if you wanted to go from port 1 to 4 you had to skip over 2 and 3 (or use the keyboard shortcut).  I like the four separate buttons a little better, but it is harder to locate the button you want without looking directly at it (I have it on a shelf under the desk and seeing the buttons isn't easy) or feeling for it.Cons:-----* The biggest thing I don't like about this switch is its physical layout.  Who thought it was a good idea to have cables sticking out of four sides of it? They certainly didn't do it to save space.  My old Belkin switch had all the cable connections in the back of the unit and a single button on the front (a much sleeker setup).  The switch itself is a little bigger than this unit, but actually uses less space due to the cable configuration on this one.  The one possible upside to this setup is that the console cables (the cables from the keyboard, mouse and monitor) are located on the front of the switch. Since USB keyboard/mouse are hot swappable (don't try that with PS/2), I suppose you can more easily change your keyboard/mouse.  Even given that, it still would have been better to put all four computer cables on the back of the unit.* This is a very minor thing, but occasionally when switching between ports (or at Windows startup) the keyboard/mouse will take several seconds to start working.* Another minor thing: The audio cables are separate from the KVM cable, and I would have liked it better if they had been molded all into the same cable.  I suppose this way is more flexible if you're not using the audio feature of switch, and a few zip ties work to accomplish almost the same result."
3309,"I bought this camera to replace an 8MP model which I'd dropped, thereby causing the lens to be jammed while extended. Other than that vulnerability, which is too common among zoom-lensed cameras, I'd recommend this camera for every reason: ease of usage, optical quality, image quality (even in video mode, though don't think you can shoot a feature film with it). For me, the body of this camera, with its grip-formation, is substantial enough to hand-hold steadily and then to return to whatever pocket in which I'd been carrying it. My only complaint is that this line of Samsung cameras seems to drink batteries swiftly, particularly while shooting video, so rechargeables are advised."
3310,"Received item earlier than expected but that is what I have come to expect from Company A.As far as the product; As advertised... Needed a second mount for my wife'r car when she needs to use the Nuvi 660 we have.Works great and is as good as the original mount that came with the Nuvi when I originally purchased it.The reason for the 4 stars is because over time, these mounts tend to lose their suction... be careful NOT to leave the mount in your vehicle for extended periods of time, especially in warmer weather/under direct sunlight since the coating on the suction cup will literally melt onto your windhsield and is next to impossible to remove the mount from your windshield without permanently damaging the cup...Overall nice product but will need to be replaced over time due to loss of suction power."
3311,"i just spent 45 days in Europe with a car. we spent the first month in Italy and then traveled to Austria, Czech Republic, Amsterdam and down to France. for the vast majority of the time, the 370 provided very good directions. however, one time the GPS sent us down a hiking path in Austria to the back door of the hotel (i had to turn around in a field of tall grass on the side of a mountain). on the way to Cinque Terre, the GPS sent me through a small village and onto a street between buildings where i had about 2 inches clearance on either side of the car for about 70 meandering meters -- very, very, very slow driving. this was clearly not the main traveled highway to Cinque Terre (using the default settings of the GPS). in Milan, the GPS wanted me to go down a 1-way road the wrong way and i had difficulty getting it to redirect me as it kept trying to get me to go back around the round-about and down the road wrongly.the GPS also uses some odd phrasings -- turn onto A3 sounds more like turn on 2A3. this really confused me for the first few days. ""onto"" should be 1 word.the GPS does a poor job of pronouncing street names. now granted, i'd have trouble with these as well. but i even heard the GPS stutter once, which gave us all a chuckle.i haven't used the GPS in the USA yet as it arrived a day before i left for Europe, so these comments only apply to using it in Europe . . . but that's largely why you'd get this model. if i was going back to Europe, I'd take this GPS with me again rather than look for a new GPS. i figure non of them are going to be perfect at the USA and Europe, but i also have learned more about its nuances that perplexed me at times over the first 2 weeks or so of using it. i still felt better having it than relying on maps. i'd honestly rate it a 3.5 if that was an option."
3312,"I bought the COBY DP102 as a gift for my parents in May 2007.  I'm very pleased with it so far.  I did have some problems using it - I couldn't get it to mount via USB to my Mac to load the photos.  I ended up having to transfer files to the SD Card, but it worked perfectly after that.  My parents aren't very computer savvy, so I'm sure they'll enjoy it as a stand alone frame.As for the cropping issue - I can see that being a problem.  But since I am pre-loading the photos for my parents, I'm resizing them for the frame.  They look wonderful.  The photo quality is great for the price - I wasn't expecting High Definition on my budget."
3313,"Hi Everybody,First, let me tell you what it is:- 1.33 Ghz. Core Solo Intel processor.- 1 Gb RAM.- 1 320*200 pixels Motion Eye integrated camera on the front to be used as a webcam (the best i've seen to date. By far better than my Macbook pro's iSight)- 1 1.x Mega Pixels integrated camera on the back intended to take picture and it even has a ""capture"" button but... the software leaves something to be desired.- Biometric reader which beyond letting you login to windows, it's supposed to be used as your password assistance everywhere... i can't make it work the way it should...- Integrated mouse and keyboard.- 1 USB 2.0 port- Microphone and headphones ports- Memory Stick DUO PRO port- Dock Port- Integrated wireless lan, Bluetooth and EDGE wan technology (the same sloooooooooooow service you get on a GSM phone like iPhone when out of Europe to connect to the internet, UMTS should be better but. let's face it, we're far away from Europe in this matter)Whar comes with it:- The computer.- The papers.- One Wired Lan and VGA out port in case you need it on the run (it connects to the dock port and it's a reasonably small cable). I spent hours trying to know if i could attach an external projector to do a presentation or to connect to LAN or both.... well with this included adapter you can and because you're reading this, if this was a concern now you can use those researching hours for something more productive like... sleeping? :)- One port replicator Dock station with 3 USB 2.0 ports, 1 VGA port, Wired Lan RJ-45 ethernet port, A/V out, 1 four pins IEEE 1394 firewire port.- A very practical carrying case that you can attach to your belt (i didn't know this and bought the very unpractical and expensive leather case which i won't use anyway)What i like:- It's ULTRA sharp screen... make no mistakes, it's wonderful. I just can't emphasize it enough.- It's design, let's face it... it looks great!- It's usability, despite it's small sized keyboard ,it's designed to be used by your thumbs just like the rest of the computer.- Finally... It Works!What i don't like:- It's an ultra portable computer but lacks of worldwide assistance and warranty.. which is a veeeery stupid policy from Sony... My MacBook Pro has Worldwide coverage like almost any premium priced portable just because it's portable so you can be here today and there tomorrow... and still be covered. but let's face it, Sony it's not a monopoly in consumer electronics just because the stupidness of some of their management. :(.- Battery Life.- Memory Stick instead of SD which adds no value but anyway... this is a Sony product and has to be as proprietary as it can be.- Time you spend explaining almost all the people around you that it's not a PDA... yes... it works with Vista... Yes it has a Hard Drive... Yes, it's a complete computer.... No, it doesn't works with Windows Mobile nor Symbian... but anyway it's not the product's fault... it's just because it's so small which is it's main advantage.My final comments:- With the Dock, you can have a complete computer in your hands when on the road and a desktop PC when you're in home or office, even both. Just connect your monitor, wired or wireless keyboard/mouse and everything you should connect to USB/Firewire ports and you're done!- The keyboard as well as the computer itself it's veeeeery well designed to be used with your thumbs. You can manage the mouse, the typing and everything with your thumbs and believe me, it works, most people complaints about it's tiny keyboard because it's small for their fingers and bla bla bla... but it is not designed to be used like your everyday keyboard, it's designed to be used on the road, while walking, etc. If you need to have a better keyboard with you when you're on the road and you can spare a table, i really recommend iGo stowaway bluetooth keyboard (formerly a think outside product). I have it and it couple veeeeery well with this computer... it even has an stand for the computer while typing.- Prepare psychologically to explain to people what it is (the computer) everywhere you go but, if you like showing up... it's a very good tool for that. (i don't particularly like that)Final words:- If you like it and understand what it is... just buy it, you won't regret!- If you need top performance because you're a serious gamer, just don't bother looking, at least for that use, buy a PSP which is cheaper and made just for doing it (gaming)- If you want to have a veeeeeeery advanced iPod or i might say... Walkman... remember it only has 40 gigs and Microsoft Vista which is HUGE... but you can find 1.8"" toshiba hard drives from 100 gigs to 120 gigs and maybe when you read it 200 or more gigs that you could use to upgrade your Vaio. Just as a curious comment, it uses the very same type of hard drives iPods uses.- if 40 gigs are not too much, just imagine 30... because it has a 10 gigs restore partition. My recommendation, make your restore DVDs and then reduce this partition to it's minimum... BTW, this partitions lies hidden somewhere...If only Sony had ears to listen to their customers... This should be a 7 stars product, even on a 5 star scale but... even when i like Sony, i can't understand why such an advanced and innovative company can make earing aid buds at least for internal use.PP"
3314,"This review is based on my personal experience using it. The player looks good and plays great. I have a LCD HD-TV (Most people feel the need to add what kind of TV they have, the size and all the specs but is completely unnecessary) and look amazing in both HD and Standard. I am not a tech geek, just a casual TV user. They guy that comes home from work and watches some TV and a movie here and there with the wife.PROS:1) HD-Playback is outstanding and the up-conversion on the standard DVD is amazing. I had an older Toshiba up-conversion DVD player and was not nearly as good as the Toshiba HD-A20.2) Easy to use and hook up. Has HDMI (of course) and all the other connections you would need such as composite, optical and standard.3) Ethernet connection on back. This is for Web Enabled features on some HD-DVD's and for firmware updates. I also have a BD player which does not have a Ethernet connection which I think is a drawback. (NOTE: While installing the firmware my power surged and yes it is hooked up to a surge protector. The player reset. If the DVD player is interrupted while downloading firmware it will NOT work. I brought it to Best Buy who were out of the A20 and they upgraded me to the A30. The only difference I noticed between the two is the look and the remote on the A30 can not control the TV as well. Who cares. That why we have two hands.)4) Remote can also be programmed to control basic function of your TV. The reason I am adding this is because the HD-A30 remote can not do that.5) On the front has hidden controls for a sleek look and also has 2 USB connections. The manual says for future use (good thing for the Ethernet connection). (Maybe for thumb drives and what-nots)Cons:1) A bit slow at start-up. Maybe a minute to minute and a half. But this is not a big deal. I think people only complain about it because they need something to whine about. Turn it on and by the time you tear through all the plastic and get that frustrating sticker off the dang DVD, the player will be ready to go. It is a form of a computer and they all take time to warm up.2) Firmware takes a while to download and install. The firmware is not detrimental to watching movies. It is easiest to do it while you are just watching TV and not when you are getting ready to watch a movie.3) The remote could be set up a bit better. Just awkward.4) This is more for people with younger kids. The DVD tray is a bit delicate. My 4 year old likes to put his own movies in, the tray is a not sturdy and looks and feels like it could break easy so be careful. It is not delicate like a mouse trap but is not like that of the old school players.Overall this player is great and I am glad I bought it. I have watched is HD, Transformers, 300 (looked grainy but I read that is done on purpose by the director). In Standard and all looked great, Blood Diamond, The Condemned, Invincible, and the greatest movie ever made National Lampoons Christmas Vacation (never to early to watch that one).GO NEW YORK ISLANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!"
3315,Bought a generic charger that would not charge my M11x r2 so I found this. Was a legit Midnight brand and charged the battery. Unfortunately the same thing happened to this as my other Midnight charger was the connector ended up getting stressed and frayed the wires. I was able to fix it by removing the connector and resoldering everything and putting on a hefty amount of shrink wrap.Usual Midnight quality but it was a good price. 4 stars
3316,"**NOTICE: Bose has since fixed the headband durability with their Triport AE2.  Buy those instead.**Pros: Great sound, portable, light-weight, extremely comfortableCons: Earpads aren't durable, leaks sealant if stored in high heat, picks up EMI easily, headband plastic eventually breaksPurchase Date:August 2006 Purchase Price:$139.00I have owned the Triports for nearly four years now and have compared them side-by-side to revered audiophile headphones.Value:  I consider these to be audiophile-grade headphones on par with the Grado SR-125. For about 2/3 the price, you can have headphones of comparable sonic quality, but lack the comfort and sound isolation of the Bose.  In fact, I find the non-padded Grado to be downright painful. However, Grado headphones will last longer than the Triports. It's up to you though whether the extra comfort is worth giving up durability.Audio Quality:  These are incredibly sensitive headphones.  They pick up everything, which can be bad or good depending on how you look at it.  On the bad side,  I have heard CB radio over them and interference over the PCI bus from the hard drive and my GPUs.  They have a decently large soundstage for headphones in their price range and resolution similar to the Grado SR125; though they are a bit heavier in bass.  I also compared them to the Sony MDR-SA5000 DJ headphones among others, and while the Sonys sound faster and cleaner, they have a nasty frequency response and a very narrow soundstage.  These headphones are very easy to drive and are great for use with portable devices unlike a lot of high-end headphones which need expensive amps.  They also are great at blocking out external sounds. If I could improve these, I'd give them a larger soundstage and more accurate imaging; though some may prefer a more intimate/direct listening experience.Design:  A lot of reviews mention the plastic 'Y' connector breaking, but this problem was fixed in late 2005.  These headphones actually are quite hard to break.  I've dropped them many times,  tripped over the cord yanking them out of my computer, and slammed drawers closed on the cord; and they still work. However, the plastic wears out on the headband, developing stress fractures after years of constant use, eventually coming apart at the piece that holds the earcups on. There are also two  other major problems I don't see in other reviews.  Leaving the headphones in too high of a temperature will cause black rubbery acoustic sealant to leak from all the plastic joints behind the earcups, making them sticky.  Also, the earpads will flake and separate at the seams after about a year of use.  I finally got sick of buying new sets for $15 each, and just sewed them back together; though they're flaking everywhere.Comfort:  These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used.  The headband exerts no pressure and the earpads sit around your ears and are amazingly soft.  They do get slightly hot after a while, but all closed headphones do.Overall:  These are decent headphones for people who like excellent sound quality, wear headphones for an extended amount of time, and often use portable devices. However, there are cheaper headphones with similar sonic qualities, and the Triports eventually break (mine broke after 4 years of continuous use of around 4 hours a day, I fixed the broken part with superglue). However you're also paying for a lighter design with sound isolation that doesn't need an amp to sound good.  Just make sure you don't leave it in a hot car and have enough money to keep replacing the earpads, or sewing skills."
3317,"Company A should find some way to link the reviews / ratings for the different versions of this device (black, white, pink) instead of making us look them up separately.Good sized; as it is not bulky like over-the-ear-phones and the electronics capsule is small.Good value; as you will most likely not need to make payments on something that you may not need to use very frequently.Good performance; as it blocks the overall noise level nearly as well as most hearing protection earplugs and cancels the annoying, low level background rumble that makes you tired and cranky. This product helps you play music, etc at a lower level and save your hearing. The only problem I had was the times my ears ""popped"" during ascending and descending, it seemed a little more painful, but that may have just been that I am an infrequent flier and my ears are kind of sensitive. It also comes with an airline headphone adapter that did not work too well for me -- I think it was the crummy, abused jack and system on the airplanes as it works well with my laptop."
3318,"I have been using the soft rim trackpoint cap, and it is a great improvement. The other tips aren't as good, but I would recommend this just for the soft rim cap. These will make the trackpoint a lot easier to use."
3319,"starting off kept me just set the assumption for this device.  I have practically canceled all my cable and satellite stuff. I can stand traditional TV anymore. I definitely am a pod casting type and love the idea of all the indo shows that are popping up mainly in the US and UK.  I can totally see that we are headed towards a new revolution in this new medium.Apple definitely has made it easy with this 1st version consumer line pod cast device. The setup was easy however I was not happy with the networking aspect of it.  I think they still need to tweak a bunch of things in the device. Being a Mac person, I am being honest about this device. I have initial trouble with one Intel Mac not seeing the device and the other older PPC's did. However my entire objective with this device was streaming from my computer to my big TV.Speaking of which, I have an old 43'' Toshiba with component connection and it works fine. U probably wont get the HD quality but it does work; unlike what it says in the system specifications.My favorite part is the itunes store movie trailers. Now when I go to a theater (especially in this part of the world) people keep asking me where did u see that ad?!!? Well on my Apple TV!  I Love the interface and how quick it moves around. Setup is simple if one of your iTunes library can see the device. I think a great deal of this depends on your internet and router setup.I am sure in the next firmware they will address several issues but for now I am glad to replace my traditional TV content with the mind jolting 300+ podcast show I get to watch every day and choose from.iTunes movies and music are great as well. However I really can't comment on the quality of the movies since I don't have a true HD TV.  My TV is 1080i capable. However the quality is definitely good of those movies. My best part are the free Sesame Street shows which my kids enjoy.  Welcome to the world of true 24x7 global content."
3320,"I bought this for the bedroom. I dont know why others are having problems with the built in DVD player, because mine works perfect and I've had no other mechanical problems.  The TV is light-weight and does not take up a lot of space on the dresser which is why I bought it. I can easily move it aside when dusting the dresser. It's very good at picking up digital channels even with a regular antenna.  I can only give it 4 stars for picture quality.  When watching local channels you have to sit in front of the TV and look at the screen straight on. Otherwise,if you look at the screen from an angle, the colors & contrast seem faded.  It is not the TV's fault, but the type of screen cover the manufacturer has put on the TV. However, when watching DVDs, the colors & picture clarity are AWESOME from any angle.  I now enjoy watching DVD movies in bed. In summary, it serves it's purpose for watching TV in bed before I fall asleep and not taking up much room on the dresser. I would recommend it for the bedroom, the kitchen, or where space is limited.  I would not recommend this for the living room."
3321,"I was using creative T20's with an M-audio sound card on my linux box. They were light years ahead of the crap I was listening to at the time.I was itching for a change and heard good things about the AV40. I searched the web and read the reviews and went ahead and ordered a pair.They have been up and running for a few hours now and they very nice. I am listening to Bill Frisell's Intercontinentals and its like I am hearing it for the first time.There is more of a depth to the soundstage that the Creatives couldn't pull off. Pretty awesome. The acoustic instruments sound really good on these speakers. Later on I need to break out the Bach and Mozart : )Not too big, have a nice weight to them and seem really well made. All the needed cables come with.These are very good sounding speakers."
3322,"I had intended to buy this card with a camera but the camera wound up being out of stock. Instead of contacting me, Company A sent the card and I paid almost as much on the shipping as on the card -- which I could have gotten at the local Walmart for about the same price. I'm happy with the product but not so much with Company A."
3323,For 399 shipped I am very happy with this TV. The only thing I don't like about it is that the digital tuner is very slow!
3324,It was a gift for a family member and it seemed to last a few years and it wasn't overly exspensive so it was a good buy.
3325,So I'd rate it a 5 star if it didn't require a bit of trial and error. My setup is a direct tv box with a powered hdmi splitter also bought on Company A. The splitter has one tv with a 5 ft hdmi cord and another 50ft hdmi cord run to another room. I first tried to use this device before the split- it did not work at all. What I ended up doing was just using this booster on the line running to the 50ft to the second tv in my game room just after the splitter. Works great now and I'm able to change channels etc without losing the satellite signal like before.
3326,"During our house remodel five years ago, I wired six rooms of the house with CAT6 running all of them to our &#34;electronics closet&#34;, Although so many appliances today have wireless capability, I still prefer to hard wire TV's, media players and NAS drives to the Netgear gigabit router. Which has four cable inputs, while I need ten. This unit is exactly what I needed. I was able to install this in minutes and get all my gadgets connected. Pros - small footprint, gigabit, low power consumption, indicator lights. Cons - I would prefer that the indicator lights were on the opposite side of the unit from the cable inputs, like the Netgear router. In order to see the indicator lights I have to look through a maze of cables and cannot hide them behind the switch, very hard to organize. Hence the 4 stars."
3327,"This is a really nice little hub.  I haven't used it powered yet, but I like knowing I can plug it in if I need to.  Doesn't feel chintzy or cheap and oh yeah, it stays put for me.  The only thing that didn't work well was when I decided to plug the Afunta(tm)7.1 Surround Sound 12 Channel Sound Adapter Equalizer USB I bought here on Company A (did review that too) into this hub.  It caused a lot of &#34;noise&#34; and static.  I'm not sure why - and yes, that was one of the main reasons for buying this hub, my laptop only has 3 USB ports and one is a little wonky (keeps acting like whatever's plugged into it isn't and needs to be unplugged/plugged back in).But again, this is a great little hub for not much money!"
3328,"I bought 2 of these in 2 different colors for kids for Christmas.  One kid has a classic ipod, the other has an ipod touch.Pros:  Works great for both types of ipods and a great feature is that it charges the ipods.  Speakers play very clear and loud coming from such small speakers.  Nicely lit display so you can tell the time from across the room.  There were other things but those were our faves.Cons:  I only have 2 cons and am worried about the 2nd.  The first is that the lowest volume (at ""1"") is still too loud.  Needs to go lower.  2nd: It overheats!  It's almost painful to the touch when you've been playing the ipod in it for an hour or so, it's hot!  Anyone else have this problem?  I forsee this becoming a problem and possibly igniting a recall.  What does everyone think?  Please comment on this review...thank you!"
3329,"This only gets four stars due to the zipper difficulty.  There really isn't anything wrong with the zipper, you just have to compress the disc a bit by pushing it into the ground or you wont be able to zip it up.  I was a bit frustrated until I figured this out.  Otherwise its everything you could want in a light reflection, blocker, diffuser device."
3330,"This lens cap keeper does its job, but buying the pack of 5 is a much better value. I won't buy one alone again."
3331,You should buy this istead of the brand names.  You get the same quality for a better price.  Simple. .
3332,"The only real downside to this unit is that none of the 3 cases I have fior my kids ipod touches (3,4) will fit in the cradle without removing the case. Removing the case means they might lose the case or forget to put it back on - and that's just bad (imho). Sound quality is nice, I dont' really need the alarm function as I use my iphone's alarm. I like the portability but frankly, I don't need it. I am ok leaving this unit where it sits. There are other, smaller, portable ipod speaker systems.Still, it is well made and a good value."
3333,"Product works fine, but honestly it is absolute. Just get a smart phone and use a app to record whatever you want to record. I got this and used it for a few classes and then realized I wanted a new phone. Then I realized I could use the phone for the same thing. Ah yes, convergence at its best."
3334,"This mount worked pretty well for my new 47"" Vizio LCD.  It's sturdy, and with the HDMI cable, represents a good bargain.  My only complaint is that with a large TV, it's impossible to access the tilt adjustment knobs without removing the TV from the wall.  However, once it's mounted and the adjustment is to your liking, you probably won't ever need to change it."
3335,"I did a dumb thing last Tuesday - while at the airport, I had my fully outfitted Canon D20 rig - battery grip pack, 4 batteries, several lenses, remote trigger, external flash, 3 GB CF mini hard drive card and a case full of other stuff.  While on the shuttle train to my gate it was on my shoulder on the seat.  When the train stopped, I jumped off with my laptop, but the camera bag had slipped off onto the seat - I didn't notice the weight change on my shoulder.  As the door was closing, I saw my camera drive off in an empty train to pick up more travellers.  $3000+ in camera gear soon to be in the hands of a new owner :-(  I called Lost and Found, but let's face it - it's gone for good.  Oh well - I make good money, and it's just 'stuff' - what else can you do, ya know?  I can only say I'm glad I didn't have my GPS, point-and-shoot, 700p  PDA cell phone and car keys in the same case like I normally do when I travel (I fly a lot).  This one day, all the other stuff was in my laptop case.Soooo.... today I bought the Nikon at Costco in a 2 lens kit for about $970.  I fully knew it wasn't the pro grade that my Canon was.  But I just wanted to 'get back in it' as I take a LOT of photos for work and pleasure.The D40x takes GREAT photos - but I quickly found a few limitations that I have not seen posted.  There is no direct entry for color temperature.  Since I shoot semi professionally, and use a color temperature meter on a regular basis, I feel this is important.  With the Nikon, you can only set the 'lighting type' - outdoors, tungsten, flourescent, etc.  No direct entry of color temp in Kelvins.  Also, there is no instant access to ISO - another important feature the D40x lacks.  There is no external sync PC connection for pro flash gear (I use Novatron flash packs in manual mode).  You have to buy a hot shoe adapter to get this - no biggie, but it's more money and not included.But I will say it's WAY faster than the Canon D20 was - very quick to start, and no lag between shots.  The ergonomics are better in some ways - it's WAY lighter, but a little small.  There's no LCD on top, and only one encoder wheel (which limits how many changes you can make quickly).  The built-in editing and such are fine if you want that stuff in the camera.  I don't - I use Photoshop and do all that stuff on the computer.  Also, I normally shoot RAW + Large JPEG - the D40X only allows RAW + 'basic' JPEG - you cannot do 1:4 large JPEGs and RAW at the same time - I consider this a limitation, as it means I must do the conversion in the computer instead of just dumping both formats onto the editing disk.  For point and shoot, it isn't an issue.I think it's a great semi-pro camera - if you are looking for a GOOD 'point and shoot' this might be the ticket.  If you are looking for a GOOD  DSLR, I'd go for the Nikon D80 instead.  I chose the D40X on the thought that next year, the D80 class will be 20 Megapixels, and I'll just hang on until then to move back into a pro-class DSLR.  So my issues really relate to the fact I didn't want to jump right back in with another $3000 to get to where I was on Tuesday.  I did NOT expect the D40x to be pro grade - it's a VERY good camera for what it is.Oh, and if you happen to have 'found' a Canon D20 camera and bag on a train to the south terminal of the Seattle airport on May 22 at 7:30 AM, I'll happily give you a VERY generous reward for returning it to me :-)"
3336,"These are excellent headphones, both in construction quality and sound quality. They are comfortable for long sessions, and the tonal quality and dynamic range are impressive. The earpieces set on the ear, not around them, but are very comfortable. The noise-cancelling feature works very well; those listening on internet chat say the sound quality is excellent, with no static or stray noises.My first pair had a defective microphone, Company A replaced it within two days with a fine working replacement.The microphone is not powered and my Intel Mac requires a powered microphone in the Mic Input jackslot. I had to acquire a USB adaptor, but then it worked perfectly. These do not come with a USB plug, only mini-jacks.All in all I am very satisfied with these and would highly recommend them."
3337,"Overall, I love this flash. It's powerful, with plenty of features, and can be controlled from the menu on my Canon 7D camera. (This can be done with many of Canon's newer cameras.) So I don't have to use the somewhat clunky display/button system on the back of the flash unit itself. The Multi function (stroboscopic) feature is great fun, although it takes some practice to get usable images.The only reason I didn't give the 580EX II five stars is the intermittent connection problem. You can find lots of discussion of it and recommended fixes on the Internet. What apparently happens is that sometimes one of the pins on the flash doesn't set quite right on the camera. The camera then thinks it's a TTL flash rather than ETTL-II and fires the flash at full power. The usual result is a blown out shot. I've always been able to get it to reset by disconnecting and reconnecting the flash cord, remounting the flash, and/or turning it on and off once or twice. Very annoying though if you've got a time sensitive shot to take.Much as I like this unit, I'm thinking of replacing it with the new 600EX-RT. Although my camera won't use all the functions of that flash, the ability to focus the flash beam to 200mm (as opposed to 105mm on older Canon flashes) would be really handy shooting night football, which is my primary use. (Indoors I use the smaller and quite functional 430EX, which also works well as an optical slave to the 580EX II.)"
3338,"Highly recommend this item if you wish to be in the picture.  The vendor's delivery time was fine, will buy from this vendor again."
3339,"Bought it for my son for his birthday. Bought one without the radio for my oldest previously and he recommended it. it's easy to use, no cd required, and small enough to carry around when you are working out or walking around town. My son is never without it as he walks many miles around town with his friends. Also small enough to wear while he is working out at the gym. (My son is a teenager) Comes with earphones so everything he needs was included."
3340,"I bought this after trying (and returning) the ziplock bag styleUnderwater Housing Case for Canon Powershot SD1100, SD1000, SD890IS, SD850IS, SD790IS SD770IS, SD750, SD630, Digital Cameras.This gives you access to virtually all buttons (not the printer button at the top of the back.)  There are only two real negatives that I need to mention.  First, the manual says the yellow O-ring which seals around the closure should be replaced every year.  However, I cannot find it anywhere for sale.  The manual says to buy it from Canon directly, but they do not seem to sell it on their website.  If anyone has a source for these, please note it in the comments.Second, the buttons on the back are not labeled at all.  This means you have to remember which buttons do what.  After a half hour or so of trial and error, I am now familiar with them.One thing not evident from the photos on this site is that the white flash filter is a separate part that attaches around the lens.  It sticks out from the camera and I found it caught a few strands of seaweed which got in a few of my photos.  I don't understand why they didn't just put the filter on the inside of the flash portion of the plastic case.I bought mine directly from Adorama for the same price as it is here and got free shipping.EDIT: I just noticed that the buttons ARE labeled - with very light etchings.  No was you can see that underwater.  I only just noticed it.  Could not possibly be fainter markings."
3341,"Great charger,  a ton better than the lame a ones that apple gives you with the shuffle when it was new."
3342,"I picked up these headphones for my computer to replace an old pair that had come to the end of a long, useful life.These headphones sound great!  Not quite as good as my Koss Pro4AAT titanium pro headphones, but close!  They're pretty light and I don't find them uncomfortable -- the ear pieces have a swivel that helps them fit nicely.  They do a good job of isolating you from outside noise.On the downside, they don't look very durable.  They're made of lightweight plastic, and they don't look like they'd stand up to much abuse.  In particular, the wire enters the left earpiece through a hole without any reinforcement or strain relief -- I'm aware of it each time I turn my head.  Although only time will tell how well it survives.  Given the modest price, I'm not too worried."
3343,These things are brest for listening to action movies and cranking up music. Others are not disturbed and they're not too heavy or hot. I'm surprised that I use them so often at the computer even when I don't have to.
3344,"I spent a lot of time researching before I settled on this TV. I have no regrets. The picture is fantastic!I have to admit that the built in speakers are not great. When I first used the TV, they didn't sound good. I tweaked the audio settings and the sound improved. After having the TV for a few weeks now, the sound is fine. If you are an audiophile, you will probably need to use your own speakers. For me, I am quite satisfied.Another warning -- the glossy finish on the screen does enhance colors and the overall picture but it will pick up reflections from windows in the room (like any glossy screen would). Keep that in mind and consider a TV with a matte finish if this is going to bother you.Those two caveats aside, I LOVE THIS TV.I was a concerned about ordering such an expensive item online but everything worked out fine. Just read all the reviews of the seller."
3345,"This device has lots of good points and only a few bad points and bugs.First, the good.1. The sound quality is fantastic, much better than my first generation iPod. I am using my own headphones, the provided ones have not been opened.2. Transfering files is fast and simple, no software is needed although a CD is provided.3. The response is super fast. This is also bad, see below.4. There have no glitches, no freeze-ups, no occational skipping. That last one is important as my old iPod got jittery all too often.5. Although it is not the cheapest, it is substantially less that the iPod Nano.6. The screen is bright, colorful, and clear, at least indoors.7. The battery charges quickly and lasts forever.8. I don't use pictures much on these tiny devices but the images I tested by loading them through the Samsung software were excellent, considering the tiny screen.9. It looks nice!Now, the bad.1. The controls are so fast I still haven't figured out how to avoid holding them down too long. The screen sometimes goes wild jumping from menu-to-menu as I clumsily try to stop pressing buttons!2. The provided software is mediocre at best and doesn't run very well under Vista. Everytime it starts up, it goes into convulsions before settling down. After that, is is fine. Works properly on my XP desktop.3. I have yet to figure out how to get playlists over to the device. Every playlist, rather than being a reference, starts copying duplicates of the files already there. I don't have the space for that.4. It is easily scratched even just sitting there. Get screen protectors for it before you even take it out of the box.Finally, the ugly.1. My 1 Gig iPod was never filled so I got the 2 Gig Samsung. Wow, it holds less that the smaller iPod. However, I think the sizes are larger which may be why the sound quality is so much better. Get the 4 Gig model.2. The device is really geared for Europe. None of the free-for-30-days music stores with free downlaods are available to those of us in North America.3. The on-line registration is crazed, I filled out the form at least 5 times and each time some silly tiny ""mistake"" was made. It didn't even like my address! I gave up.Over all, this is a great compromise between the expensive iPods and the error-prone cheaper models of mp3 players."
3346,"Works as it should ... no regrets; paid a fair price and have no complaints. I would recommend this item if price is a factor. If not, then of course a chordless option would be better."
3347,I've purchased my second MX-1 enclosure to use with a Tivo series 3 for storage expansion.  It's replacing a cheaper enclosure that caused my Tivo to reboot all the time.It is quiet enough that I have one in the bedroom and I don't have any noise issues with it.  It is rather large but maybe that helps with air flow and cooling the hard drive.I'm giving it four stars due to the difficulty of replacing a couple screws along each side of the hard drive that others have mentioned.  They are small screws and you either have to squeeze your fingers in there which is a bit painful or use another tool to hold it.It's a bit pricey for being just an enclosure but it's quiet and has been more reliable for me than a cheaper unit.  I like that there is just a small blue LED in the front.  It doesn't interfere with watching TV in a dark room.  If you are looking for a good enclosure to use with a Tivo this is the one.
3348,"This lens is awesome. It is a very sharp lens and for the price it is a must have for people on a budget. The only thing I didn't like was that it was made out of plastic and has a cheap feel to it, but what can you expect from such a cheaply priced lens."
3349,"I own an analog version of the Panasonic DVD recorder which I have been very satisfied with.  After reading the reviews on this Digital HD recorder, I almost decided not to try it but I did buy it and it works well for me connected by HDMI cable to my HD Toshiba Regza TV.  I am very pleased with this product."
3350,"I work in a windows based system 40+ hours a week. Back in the days of DOS I knew dozens of ways to move with keyboard shortcuts. New system doesn't allow that about half the time. Result= Mouse Elbow. Changing desk set up didn't work. Had to try something different. Vertical mouse arrives- Quality is very good. Love the silky feel of it. Took about an hour to get used to, and I still struggle going back an forth between old mouse at home and this one, but the pain has lessened. One caveat- it is very heavy compared to old mouse. That was an issue for me because my keyboard tray was at an angle. It was continually falling off the tray. Had to flatten out tray- still getting used to that.I wasn't able to use the software so extra buttons are lost on me. It does allow me to go back and forward online only. IT lockdown issues were the cause not the product.Bottom line- you have nothing to lose but the pain. I would recommend as a fellow sufferer."
3351,"No problem about the quality. I bought it as 3$ (prime) if I remember correctly. Though I pursue this one half years ago, it hasn't been used until last week I got a blu-ray player."
3352,I hooked them up and they worked. The price was right and they did what I expected video cables to do.
3353,"There are so many informative reviews on this page. The most important thing to know is that it doesn't decode HDMI audio. I am not clear as to weather or not that problem is solved if your player decodes the signal before sending it to the receiver. That is something you might want to look into. As for the sound, this system sounds really great for the price. I love it."
3354,"I have bought this item 4 times in the past two years (for my own personal use and also for building computers for friends). 2 fans come in each pack, so that is a total of 8 fans.Of the 8, all of them are still spinning. However, on 3 of them some of the LEDs have burnt out.They are not dead silent running at the highest RPM setting but they are decently quiet. They move a decent amount of air.These fans can often be bought here for cheap (&lt;$10) ... I would recommend them at that price but not any higher."
3355,"I received these speakers on time via U.P.S..I was suprised how heavy the speakers are. Look well made and solid. The speaker grills are good looking but very flimsey. (cheaply made) Like others, I had one broken speaker grill. After hooking them up and putting a graphic equalizer in the set up I was very pleased with the results. I had to make a few adjustments to my T.V., subwoofer and equalizer. My other speakers center front and rear surround are JBL brand. They seem too work fine with the Sony fronts.I like so many others was well pleased with the results. Voice and music was as good as i could expect. These speakers replaced 2 twenty year old Yahama floor speakers. Quite a difference. The Sony speakers are more than good, they are very good. I would recommend them to anyone, buyer will not be sorry."
3356,"I purchased these for a simple analog 2.1 channel AV application.  Everything is running through a Sherwood receiver and the speakers sound great!  My only negative comment might be the size.  They are just an odd size.  I knew what the size was when I ordered them and anticipated placing them on speaker stands.  At 20"" tall and 10"" square they just look top heavy.  The wife is afraid I would create a death trap for the cat should he knock one off the stands.  Regardless, I found an alternate mounting option and everything sounds great. The cat is safe and we are now enjoying DVD's, Netflix and content from my new Roku player with complete enjoyment.  Even NPR radio sounds better...Yes, buy them, but don't use with tall flimsy speaker stands."
3357,"Outstanding, very good its SONY at it again.!!!......these guys know how to get customers satisfied....av coupled these to my DENON AVRX 4000 Lovely............"
3358,"ok this cooling fan is very quiet almost can't hear it. other reviews are worng on this this is very quiet, and is very good for price and also hase 4 usb ports wich are very useful. with that said it is plastic and very flimsy the usb ports are a very tight fit and just all in all not put togeather very well i could see if you have a heavy laptop it could push on the fram making it hit the fans making noise but i have an ibm very light and powerful laptop with no air vents on bottom so it would heat up quite a bit. after recieving this didn't think it would help much but after acidentally leaving my laptop on overnight yesterday i found it to be fairly cool was still warm to touch but not hot as usual this is a very god, it will cool but as i stated above it is very flimsy and dousn't come with power adapter guessing it is sold seperatly . air flow design works very well but it will bend easily and is made of weak plastic. if this was made with aluminum and usb ports where better construcked this would be top of the line but it is not.  you get what you pay for. i guess."
3359,"These are the first noise canceling headphones I have tried and I was surprised at the limited the frequencies at which they work. These are extremely effective at canceling out low frequency noise. I tried them on a loud diesel engine and while I still heard every bit of the higher frequency noise from the engine, but the low frequency noise disappeared. I also tried them with running water and they did nothing at all, because the frequency of the noise was too high. I did not get a chance to try it on board a plane, but i imagine they would work fairly well in that circumstance since most of the engine noise is pretty low frequency.I don't think this is particular to these headphones and these headphones seem to be very well constructed so that is why they merit 4 stars. They are also as comfortable as any over the ear headphone. The sound quality seemed fine. The headphones themselves without the noise canceling manage to block a lot of outside sound due to their good fit. The case these come with is very nice."
3360,"works fine. im glad i bought it. i use 2 pieces more than the others. it works in my camera, my cell phone and other electronics i have. hold alot of info too."
3361,The original Battery that came with the camera stop charging and i order a new one.So far i am happy with it. It is working well
3362,"Well I bought this bag from Company A.com, it came earlier than expected so that was cool. I bought this bag to carry my 14"" laptop because I already broke 2 others that weren't designed for laptops, so the design of the bag was important because it had to resist the weight of my laptop, my lunch and a book. Also one important issue was that the bag should NOT resemble a laptop bag, I live outside the US, so one can get mugged pretty easy if people can tell that you have a laptop on you. This bag looks perfect and when I put my 14"" computer, it was like I had plenty of space and noone could tell a laptop was in there.One thing I didn't like, it's kind of big for me (I'm 5'7 and 100lbs), though NOT something that is out of place. It's a just a little too big.For a 14"" it's very roomy. I like the inner compartment. It has a tight sleeve for the laptop (for 14"" it's ok, for a 15"" the laptop was really hard to take out). It has several pockets also.I recommend it."
3363,"Explored a lot of options to replace my 2008 Mazda 3 factory speakers. These work fine if you don't plan on removing the plastic that in close the factory speakers on the door panel with a dremel. I didn't want to hack up my door so I went with these instead of infinities or image dynamics. The speakers cleared fine. The speakers weren't exact fit and I could only get on 2 screws instead of all four, which I thought was going to make it rattle. After everything was put back together it didn't have a problem. Most my friends have better systems than I do which comes with amp, component speakers and sub, so I have some what of an ear for sound quality. These do not sound bad for the price or the fact they are just running from the stock HU. What I have notice is that they do not produce a lot of bass, but the high and mids are fine. I find that the highs tend to be bright when I mess around with the treble compared to the stock speakers. These definitely produce better vocals than the stock speakers but lack the bass power. I'm planning to install a 2 channel amp to the stock HU to see if that changes anything and will update the review.Overall I think this is a good purchase to upgrade from stock speakers if you are not a bass head. The sound is clear if you mess around with the setting in your car. As always when it comes to audio, rely on your ears and just use reviews as guidelines. Hope this helps and happy buying."
3364,The DB Link fuse holder is a standard fuse holder and works well.  I have no complaints with its use.  The quality appears to be high and should work well for any car audio system.
3365,Great value...the only problem I had to overcome was setting the HDMI output.  The DVR would not allow me to switch to HDMI without sensing a HD TV and my HD TV would not activate the HD inputs without an HD signal from the DVR (the TV is also manufactured by Phillips).  I was able to fool the DVR/TV by memorizing the key strokes and programming the DVR without the TV screen display.
3366,"These are great headphones until suddenly, one day, they start shutting off. Don't get your panties in a twist over this. There is a simple solution (after much surfing and question asking). Make sure the volume on your TV is set pretty high and the volume on the headphones is set lower so that the danged things don't think you shut the TV off, causing them to pop and go dead which results in unplugging the power and plugging it back into the receiver.These have a great range and are marriage savers. The sound quality is good (according to my husband whom I bought them for instead of banishing him from TV). He says they are comfortable and he runs around the house listening to a game of some sort or the other without bothering me or causing me to want to bean him with a rolling pin.Great exercise too! If he hears that a great play was made that he missed, he runs to the TV to watch the instant replay! WIN! WIN!"
3367,"I really enjoy the look, durability, and functionality of the case. I'd give it 5 stars except it's measurements (external) were 1/2&#34; off in width and height. Not a problem normally, but I have an oversized 17.3&#34; laptop (Asus gamer). A regular 17.3&#34; would fit fine, but I needed just 1/4&#34; more in width. I highly recommend this bag for anyone who needs a really rugged catalog case and the ability to carry a laptop. I like the dual locks. I wish more cases were built this well. And the price can't be beat."
3368,"No rocket science here: needed a 2"" desk thingy to give a granite slab desk that ""finished look"". The Belkin Hub does the trick. Reality is I probably need five more outlets, but just daisy-chained a small 4-fort hub into this one. Bingo. Always on. Always ready. Never fails. Love just one cord to deal with when I need to dash out the door without the toys. In the past it was a cobweb of cords that cluttered my desk and slowed me down when I needed to come or go with the laptop. I like it."
3369,"Garmin makes some of the best GPS systems out there, and this personal navigator doesn't disappoint. Simple to use and very easy to update. Only negative was one of quality control; the wrist strap and the battery door post ring broke off shortly after I began using the device. Still functions quite well."
3370,This worked exactly as I wanted: No power just a simple portable CD player speaker - pretty hard to come by today.  The sound was absolutely good enough!
3371,"We purchased a used NEX 5N that turned out to have lots of spots on the censor.  It wasn't dust, and the rocket blower didn't help. The first swab from this kit I was too gentle with, but with the second one I was less cautious and managed to get the sensor much cleaner.  Pictures afterwards have been splotch-free and I've noticed no streaking or other problems.  I haven't used the pads yet, but am otherwise pleased with the purchase."
3372,"I have used it with a 5dMII and 6D + 24-70 lens, under heavy rain and it performed perfectly. Its a bargain considering the price of other rain sleeves.One recommendation, get a rubber to keep the part that cover the lens in place."
3373,"Keeps my cpu at room temperature. I would recommend use with arctic silver paste, the cheap crap they give you isn't very good. The cpu fan can be driven from the motherboard or from molex with a speed control potentiometer. MAKE SURE your case is big enough to fit this thing. IT IS HUGE. Make sure there is enough room above the motherboard for this thing, but also enough room around the cpu, especially between the cpu socket and the pci slots. I nearly had an issue with the heatsink touching the top of my graphics card. My only other complaint is that it can be a little difficult to clean because of all the fins (which collect dust like crazy). When you try to remove it to clean it with canned air, you are likely to poke yourself on the fins, or get caught on one of them and bend it out of shape. Be careful around the fins. Overall though, I would buy this cooler again. It looks awesome in my case with the blue leds."
3374,"I love photography, and as much as I'd love to own a dSLR it's just not in my budget at the moment. This is the next best thing, in my opinion. I love the option of full manual control, and the automatic and program modes make this camera nearly foolproof. I was taking great pictures right out of the box, and they've only gotten better as I've learned more about the camera. Contrary to what other reviewers have experienced, I've enjoyed the AA batteries. It's nice to know that if I'm out on vacation and run the batteries down, I can pop into Walgreens and grab a pack for $4 rather than being without my camera until I can charge it. I immediately replaced mine with Low Self-Discharge rechargeables and find they have a remarkable lifespan. I can take probably 300 pictures or more on a charge. I've been using this camera for 6 months now, and here are some of my experiences with it:Pros:1. Zoom- Once you get used to it, the zoom is really precise. I can compose a shot in under a second without having to fiddle with it too much. At first, the variable speed zoom lever takes a little trial and error though.2. Hotshoe- To be honest here, I don't have a speedlight yet. But I am thrilled to have the option and it's next on my list to purchase.3. Layout- I find the buttons, menus and overall layout of the camera extremely intuitive and easy to use. Buttons are easily accessible and comfortable while gripping the camera. After one quick read through the manual, I could easily locate any setting I might need in the menu system.4. LCD- I am so addicted to the pivoting screen that I'm afraid I won't be able to take pictures without it when the time finally comes to upgrade from this camera. I love that I can take eye-level shots of my kids without crawling through the mud with them, lol. I can compose shots that do not include tourists' heads because I can hold the camera above the heads and still see the screen. I can take a family portrait and see that everyone is actually in the frame. Brilliant!5. Picturesa. Auto- This camera takes some of the best exposed, consistently good pictures of any point and shoot I've ever used. This holds especially true in low light.b. Manual- Mastering manual control was much simpler than I thought. Nearly all the adjustments can be made with the 4-way button. The on-screen meter runs a little underexposed for my taste, but only by about 1/4 stop. I just compensate accordingly with my settings.6. Focus checking- I frequently use the feature that shows where the camera focused after the shot. It's as easy as tapping the display button while the review image is displayed on the screen and it shows a crop at 100%, a bounding box around the focal point, the histogram and a few other details. This can be an invaluable tool when shooting because nearly all shots look sharp on the LCD of a digital camera. It's not till you download them to your computer or try to print that you'll realize if the focus was off.7. Size/weight- The camera just feels good in the hand. Enough weight and grip to balance nicely and get a stable shot. The ergonomics make it easy to hand hold, even with one hand.Cons:1. Noisy- At anything above 200 (and sometimes even lower than that), the pictures are really noisy.2. Lens cap- This might seem like a petty complaint, but really the lens cap is an important part of any camera, protecting its most delicate part. And this one is terrible. It falls off if you so much as look at the camera too hard. Forget about tossing it in a bag or purse, you'd better have a dedicated camera bag for it in case the cap pops off in transit (which it most certainly will).3. Lack of available accessories- This really limits this camera, in my opinion. The only accessories available for this model are wide angle, teleconverter and close up lenses. A greater variety of lenses and other accessories (like the underwater housing available for previous models) would have been nice.In addition to these cons, I have had 2 problems this far: the supplied USB cable died after only a few months. While I realize cables are cheap and readily available, it was a difficult problem to diagnose and caused a lot of frustration. For the price of this camera, and the fact that it comes with zero accessories, I expect the things it did include to be of a higher quality. The other problem I have is that after less than 6 months of use, the pivoting screen no longer consistently detects it's position. When I try to flip the screen outward, the camera switches the display back to the viewfinder. It works fine when I have it opened away from the camera, but as soon as it clicks in place, the display transfers. I have to turn the camera on and off several times to restore correct functionality of the screen. This is frustrating, and I've missed a shot several times because I am fighting with the camera instead of taking pictures. I plan to contact Canon customer service about this issue, but was waiting until after my recent family vacation in case the camera needs to be sent in for service. I docked the rating of the camera 1 star for the Cons and also this problem. Otherwise, I couldn't be happier with my choice of camera!"
3375,"This kit had all the things I needed in order to install my amp to my car and my sub.  The wiring is not the highest quality but then again it is probably the best I could have gotten for how much I spent.  The wire clamps barely fit onto the massive 4 gage wire and then barely fit into my amp but its nice to know that I have that extra 'bandwidth' so to speak.Overall, great product for the price you pay for it.  Functional and got the job done.  Haven't had any problems for the year I have had it installed."
3376,"The keyboard works just fine! I have a Windows 7 Notebook and it recognize the device in seconds. The mouse is to high for my hand. I used a Microsoft natural mouse for 7 years and I never had wrist pain. Now I had some inconvenience with the new mouse because you cant put your hand over the mouse. It's just to big, so you have to put your hand aside and it give me wrist pain. I'm thinking to switch back to my old Microsoft natural mouse.It has some cool features such as 5 programmable keys to run your favorites applications, it also has music volume control and mute, a button to the web, a button to search, a button to your e-mail and a button for calc application.It also has a function lock that transforms your Function keys in microsoft office commands. Very cool if you work on those applications constantly.I also have a problem with the keys becouse I'm a spanish speaking person, and the keys are in english layout! You most have this in mind.Enjoy it!"
3377,"Product: Corsair Value Select 2GB PC2-5300 667 MHz 200-Pin DDR2 CL5 SODIMM Notebook MemoryComputer used: Midnight Mini 9 (Company B 910) with Windows XP ULCPC Home SP-3The Mini 9 came from Midnight with a mere 512MB, which bogged down the already slow computer with the pre-loaded Midnight bloatware. I wanted to max out the memory as early as possible and Midnight charged an outrageous price to upgrade to 1 GB from the factory. For the same price, I could buy a 2GB stick and max out the laptop, so it came down to the few quality vendors that produced 2GB DDR2 SODIMM modules. Corsair has a great reputation and the best price and I did not even have to mess with rebates.The RAM is advertised with a CAS Latency of 5 at 667 MHz. The Midnight Mini 9 and other netbooks that use the Intel Atom N270 processor (533 MHz FSB) will run the memory at CAS 4 straight from the SPD settings. I was not expecting or demanding lightning fast performance from the Mini 9, but I did want to max out the RAM capacity. I've run XP in 256MB and 512MB environments and found XP to be livable at 512MB so long as you're not using ""intensive"" applications like Firefox, Photoshop, audio editing applications, Office, and anti-virus programs. Many new applications like Norton, Symantec, AVG, and Avast are bloatware disguised as applications. From experience, a clean XP boot with normal applications like Outlook, Firefox, and Avast Anti-Virus will require at least 300-400 MB of physical memory. Once you start to do work with some applications, that quickly exceeds 512MB and begins to use your page file. Therefore, I recommend at LEAST 1GB of RAM for XP and Vista. 2GB sweetens the deal because the only time I have gotten close to using up 2GB in XP is with GTR Evolution at Nordschleife Nurburgring which is over 13 miles of twisty windy digital roads. Bottom line is that you're not going to tax out the 2GB in a netbook, but it is good to have!Back to the RAM itself, the Corsair packaging is HORRIBLE. They clipped the module into a clamshell casing that requires the user to pop the module out of the shell. This can severely damage the PCB and SMT components. I chose to bend the plastic shell so the module would come right out without force applied to the module. Memory modules are EXTREMELY static sensitive so I did not appreciate having to gently remove it out of a poorly designed clamshell. Crucial and OCZ use better methods of packaging their modules and Corsair could learn a thing or two from its competitors.Pros: Great price, Corsair reputation, no BSOD's or problems from the Midnight Mini 9 with the module loaded. The BIOS detected the 2GB and XP booted up without any drama.Cons: Corsair must improve their packaging. The clamshell memory module retainer will damage the module if you pry it out. Be careful not to touch the SMT components but do not force the module out.Overall: This memory is a must-buy if you have a netbook or laptop that takes 2GB or 4GB respectively."
3378,"Well i used the jumpers and added windows xp......took several attempts but its working,  only thing is its only regognising 25% of total capacity,  idk wht i did wrong?  when XP was setting up it only offered me 125gb of drive to work with...so idk.but the drive is fast and VERY quiet. wish i had the full 500gb tho."
3379,"This thing pretty much covers all the bases as an AC adapter.  Especially nice is the inclusion of the USB port, and the reversibility of the polarity to the plugs.  But what were they thinking with this collection of plugs?  They're attached to a rubber strip which is attached to... NOTHING.  All the plugs other than the one you're using WILL get lost, and probably quickly.There's a baffling little pincer of rubber at the top of the plug strip that doesn't attach to anything securely, including the wire.  It's so dumb that it's infuriating.  They should have had a slot down the side of the adapter to hold the plugs."
3380,"Love this mouse, it has a great feel if you have larger hands, the low profile on the desktop makes it very easy to use.  The thing I like the best is the fact that it shuts off after a period of non-use.  I never have to switch it off when I go home.  The only thing you have to remember is to click or spin the wheel when you first start using it."
3381,
3382,"When I got this it was different from other SanDisk cards I had.  It didn't have the rows of dots like other SanDisk had and all it said was &#34;Made In China&#34; on the bottom, with a &#34;BL&#34; # above it. I tested the card using h2testw and this card has the appropriate GB capacity, and speed is what it's supposed to be.  And I was able to find that the &#34;BL&#34; # is a valid SanDisk serial #. Also I bought shortly after 2 &#34;Ultra&#34; 16GB cars and they were similar.  I think SanDisk must just change the format every once in a while.  I've taken and transferred about 1000 images with it and have had no issues."
3383,"As an author and workshop presenter, I loved how clean and simple this product was to use.Built to be a workhorse, The Fellowes Quasar Comb Binding Machine maintained high standards in getting the joy done for a very large binding project.I highly recommend this for all to use to present professional presentations."
3384,Great picture night and day. If you want to get a picture of the bad guys that will stand up in court this is the one to buy. I've tried the lower resolution cameras and you can't get a good picture of their face. The only reason I didn't give this camera 5 stars is because it needs the ability to sense when security lights are on. The low light camera feature only turns off in daylight and floodlights tend to wash out anything light in color like faces and license plates. I plan on adding more of these cameras to my Q See DVR system because I've found that one camera isn't enough . I only have one camera now and I just came home to find my passenger side window smashed on my car. The perpetrator manage to stay out of sight of the camera.
3385,"The head phones have good sound, although not excellent.  They block outside sound well, and have a wide volume range.."
3386,"As an illustrator, for years I've felt the pressure to give in and buy a Mac. All artists have Macs, right? It's designed for creative professionals, right?Well, as I discovered once I did give in and finally bought this one, the answer is yes and no.My primary objection to Macs in general still stands, and it is this: I don't like computers telling me what to do. I don't like hearing my computer cry, ""Excuse me. Safari needs your attention,"" or whatever it's saying in that garbled, electronic voice. It drives me crazy.The other problem we had, which we have since fixed, is that we installed an addition GB of RAM, which was causing the computer to crash constantly. The RAM was approved by Apple, and we took the computer to the Apple Store for repair twice to no avail. Only when the additional memory was removed did the problem stop, but we would still like to have a faster computer.Another thing I hate about the Mac is how much programs cost. I love CorelDraw,for example, and I see no point in switching to PhotoShop, which in my opinion gives you less and costs at least twice as much.And finally there can be compatibility issues if you're trying to work with something designed for a Windows PC, like a Word document. Of course, these problems can be fixed by buying more programs, which will cost you more money. It would actually cost less to buy an additional, cheap Windows PC to do things the Mac doesn't.But there are many great features to this computer, namely Garage Band, iWeb (with a subscription to Mobile Me, formerly .mac), iMovie HD, and all the other great programs that are a part of iLife. Right now my husband and I are working on creating an audio-book, and we are using our Mac for that. I would also like to use the Mac for creating a web presence for our company, but unfortunately I can't figure out how to insert keywords in iWeb, which basically makes it useless if you want search engines to be able to find your site.In short, this is a wonderful computer for very specific uses, although it might cost you a lot more in programs than a PC, and you might still want a PC for everyday tasks."
3387,"again purchased as a gift, didn't know if my sister had speakers or not.. so I went ahead and sent them to her.. she likes them so I feel it was money well spent,, very reasonable price as well"
3388,"The speakers were good for the value. Sound was clear. Of course, don't expect a movie theater sound system.You do get what you pay for. But the speakers do their job in outputting the sound from the pc."
3389,I bought this memory card reader because my old reader was taking extremely long loading 4GB cards. The Kingston memory card reader is compact and works great! I would definitely recommend this convenient and affordable reader.
3390,Why pay more!  This little gem works great if you can get the safety lid off!  Very compact and easy to use.
3391,"I own 4 laptops and am using this Logitech V220 on 3 of them. It won't work very well on shining surfaces (such as mylar table tops) but, that is typical of most optical mice. But, it works just great on my recliner cloth covered arm !!! My wife first had the following problem and she ""solved"" it by rebooting her laptop: after being online for a few hours, at times the cursor will turn into a vertical line and will not allow left or right clicking. At first only her mouse did this and we just swapped it out for a new one - then it happened again. She just continued to do the reboot - then it began happening to all of the V220's. I went to the Logitech website to do a driver update and found they have this really cool software which takes care of this issue with driver updates and also has a bunch of nice features included. It's called Setpoint - latest version is 620 for XP OS - other OS versions are available on their website. I think it's well worth the download and it cured the problem for me."
3392,"When I bought my latest laptop computer, it had everything on it I needed (ESata, HDMI, VGA Port, Blu-ray drive, etc.)...or so I thought. Somehow, I missed the fact that it didn't have a firewire port in the mix.The trouble is, I have both a video camera with a firewire interface and an external hard drive with it. That's when I took a closer look at the Expresscard slot on the side. A quick search led me to this card. It has two 6 pin ports on it, meaning you can connect two devices without daisy-chaining them (which I had to do with the single port on my old laptop).It works perfectly. Windows 7 64 bit picked it up immediately and installed it with no problem on my Toshiba laptop. The card had no issue recognizing my external devices. It was also a nice touch including a 6-4 pin firewire cable to connect to my camera. In my case, though, I would have preferred a 6-6 pin cable: I already had two 6-4 pin cables and a 4-4 due to my old laptop having a 4 pin interface. However, that wasn't a deal killer since, most of the time, you don't get a cable at all with an interface card. Besides, I knew before buying that the card didn't come with a 6-6 cable.The card will power low power devices that need bus power to operate, but larger ones will either need their own power or you'll have to spring for an AC adapter for the card. So, a portable hard drive meant to run off the firewire port power may or may not work on its own. Your mileage may vary. In my case, all my firewire devices have their own power, so I didn't have any issues.So, why 4 stars instead of 5?The main issue is, the card sticks out pretty far: close to 2 inches. That's not an issue when using it (and it doesn't block any other ports like older PC cards sometimes did), but when the laptop goes into the bag to transport it, out it has to come. Further, it didn't come with any kind of case to protect it, so it's vulnerable to dirt and damage when removed. Since it really has to be that big to work right, it would have been a nice touch to include a storage case (like PC cards very often did) since it's obviously likely you'll need to remove it now and then. With a card that includes what amounts to a pricey cable, the lack of a cheap plastic case is a glaring oversight.The other smaller issue is the Expresscard interface itself: it's one of those ""push to engage, push again to release"" mechanisms that is great for medicine cabinet doors, but terrible for a card where you tend to plug things into it. When you push the cable into the socket, it tends to want to push the card, which makes it eject from the slot. That's not the fault of this particular card, but the Expresscard interface. It should have used the PC card mechanism with an eject button beside the slot. That way, inserting cables merely pushes on the card and potentially only seats it tighter - which is a good thing. I didn't subtract points for this issue since it's the fault of the interface, not the card.So, overall, a great product with just a minor gripe."
3393,"I bought this adapter because my laptop came with wireless g.  Installed the card and on Vista OS had ZERO trouble getting connected.  I use the laptop constantly in my sunroom which is on the back side of the house while the router is against the front wall of the house.  Through the computer room (bedroom #2) a hallway, the living room and the sunroom I received a consistant three bars with connection rates of 80-137 Mps.  Very recently I upgraded to Windows 7 and the network card never burped once, still works like a charm.  Yesterday I installed a Hawking wirless N range extender to improve my connection in the sunroom.  I now have 5 bars all the time and a solid 150Mps connection.  Can't figure out how to improve the connection speed to 300Mps though.  Router is using 40 mHz so it should connect at 300Mps but doesn't.  Still 150Mps is pretty good and I never lose connection.I'm much more pleased with this product than most."
3394,"it was very easy to open the asus eee pc 1000 and install this memory. Just have to release the clips on the old ram, and slide the new ram in at the same angle pop it down and let the clips lock into place. I went into the bios with f2 didnt change anything, exit and save. Loaded windows checked dxdiag and its working properly. Only notice the load the pc can carry is quite better than it comes with. So i would recommend buying this. Negative reviews could just be bad ram, or inproper instalation. S**t happens. Good buy tho"
3395,"We like the many features that our TIVO offers, however, we had a problem that you should be aware of: When we 1st got our TIVO we had a rear projection TV. Shortly after that we had to replace the TV and went with an LCD. That is when we started having trouble with the remote. It would only work intermittently. After doing a bit of research we found out that if your TV uses back-lighting, you may need to adjust the setting or it can affect the function of your remote. After making a minor adjustment it worked perfectly. So if you have an LCD and have remote issues  you may need to adjust the back lighting/energy saver features.Beyond that my only real negatives are: The start up for the system is REALLY long. The menu structure could use a little stream-lining. The remote could use a few tweaks: Our old DVR had a 20 sec skip which was really nice. Instead of having to use the arrows to select letters for season pass and such, it would be better if they used the same technology as on phones where you hit a number button instead-It would save a lot of time. It would be good to have the ability to turn off/on the stereo receiver and select the input with the remote and not just the TV and TIVO. Lastly, some of the stations that we have scanned do not register with TIVO for some reason, so they have no guide information. I believe there is a way to fix this, but it should be more automatic than that.These are all fairly minor issues though more annoying then anything else. If they were addressed I'd be happy to give it 5 stars instead of four."
3396,I can't tell you how happy I am to get rid of Comcast's CRAPPY DVR.  I LOVE TiVo's interface.  It's so user friendly.  Online scheduling is worth the price of this unit by itself.  I would have given it 5 stars but you can use multi-room viewing on these yet.  I'm hoping they will correct this with a software update soon.  I had a little trouble getting Comcast's cable card to work but this wasn't Tivo's fault - Comcast is just horrible in every sense of the word.

3399,I have had different brands of CD burners over many years and found the Sony brand to be one that provides consistent quality and performance. This has been my third Sony CD/DVD burner. In the past I've also owned Memorex (good) and Lite-On (they actually provide a technology many brands utilize). I have this installed on a six year old self-built Pentium-4 system running at 2.66ghz and it runs fine. I would expect that older and less able processor systems would be suspect of newer drives based on the processor and resource demands (such as Pentium 3 processor systems). One should take this in consideration regardless of brands when updating any component of older systems. I have no hesitation or reservations with the Sony brand for most electronic components in general though.

3403,"I just got my HAM Ticket and decided I wanted to utilize a 25/65w Kenwood Mobile Rig for the house. As many experienced Amateurs know, the $150 2-Meter radio is the least of the costs when putting together a home system... it's really all about the antenna system. I took three of these poles (sourced from a local store that shares a similar name of the last day of the work week) and used them as a short antenna mast to mount a 10ft Diamond F22A antenna. I used the 3-ft Antenna Master tripod which worked great, without guy-wires, for a 25ft solution.I was able to lift/stack the top pole and antenna in order to get the third pole mounted in the middle position (no problem with that, as it is a only 4-lbs of poles and a 2-lbs of antenna, but if your balance/reaction times are off a bit, you might want to invite a friend over for backup!) Combined with a 75ft run of RU8X cable, I am able to hear and communicate with repeaters at least 90 miles away... very impressive for the 2 meter band!The nice thing about the 5-ft sections (and the three foot tripod, and 2-piece, 10-foot antenna) is that I can take the whole thing down and pack it in the back of the truck (and probably in most SUVs) in 15min, start to finish, so I can take the system with me for camping trips, extended visits to family and friends houses, etc.Hope this helped!73s!

3404,"I use this to clean coins most of the time. It does a great job.  Cleaning coins can devalue them if there is a hint that they have been cleaned.  This machine does not leave a hint on the coins.  It's easy to see that it's working on oil and grime on the coins, not only do the shine brighter, there is plenty of dirt in the stainless steel basin.  Some of the coins are literally 100 years old.  The cleaner is not silent and makes a buzzing sound, however you can't hear in the next room.  Some of these make much more noise.  The look is minimalist with only 3 buttons creating a circle around the LED.  The buttons are in the order you use them -clockwise.  I think the clear top is smart because I always wondered what was going on in there.  Anyway you can see the condensation  so you know it moving the water. UPDATE it broke customer service has been great.  I followed there directions printed a ups lable and they offered to call for scheduled pick-up.  Too bad they refunding the money instead of exchangeing it."
3405,This is the second MX Air i purchased in the past 5 years. I feel this one did not work as precisely as my previous one which i bought through Midnight. This model may have been used.The accelerometer is always jerky on flat surface. Air performance is ok.Overall the model is great. The inertial roller motion is unique and I dont think i have seen an air mouse with this feature.
3406,"I ordered this Ram and received it within 4-5 working days, when i received my order i installed the ram and with a system analyzer I found three of the four sticks were not what they were on the sticker.. I had ordered four 1gb sticks of pc2-6400 Ram and what i got was 1 pc2-6400 and three pc2-4200, I contacted them right away and they sent me four upgraded memory sticks with better quality of Kinston Brand so they get four stars for customer service.. minus one star for mis labled ram. great place just check what you buy to make sure it is the speed you ordered."
3407,"I bought this to replace a 2GB Sandisk card that lost its mind and trashed about 600 images from an overseas trip (BTW, PhotoRescue PC saved all of them - great product).  I have had good luck with Kingston in the past so I gave it a try.  So far, after about 1000 shots, mixed results on the 4GB version.  Most of the images are fine, but three are blank.  The card only cost me $12.99, so I'm willing to put up with the annoyance of an 0.3% error rate if it doesn't get any worse.  If you buy this card, I recommend that you preview all of your shots as you take them, or take multiples of everything."
3408,Fits the mentioned lens thread effortlessly; though one would be better advised to invest in another P series holder system as interchanging can be quite cumbersome!
3409,"One star less for price.  At $250 this thing exceeds the price of just about any other bracket.  Then again, once you've paid $3000 for a DSLR and $2000 for a lens, what difference does it make any more?  It is an excessively awesome bracket and being able to go from landscape to portrait without worrying about the flash makes it worth the price alone.It is also light, sturdy, and easy to use.  No buyer's remorse here."
3410,"Good product for my Sandisk 260 but the strap could be a little wider, I used the one off my old one but the silicone cover works well."
3411,"Here's the pro's of this product:- Light weight and small.  It fits snugly inside of the palm of your hand.- It comes with an off switch, which is a nice feature.  You can turn the mouse off to save battery power.- Comes with a soft carrying case, protecting the mouse during travel.- Works great with a Macbook Pro.  (Sometimes, Microsoft products don't always play well with Apple computers.)The disadvantages:- I have Apple's ""bootcamp"" installed on my Mac, which allows me to run both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on the same machine.  It's kind of funny, but the mouse works great with the Mac side, but hates Windows.  After several weeks of frustration, Microsoft Windows one day, all of a sudden, recognized that I had a mouse available to use!  Even though I had been trying to get it to recognize this blue tooth mouse the whole time, it finally figured it out...  ;-)- Both the Mac and Windows side tend to ""temporary"" lose their connection to the mouse once in a while.  This is only temporary until you either click the mouse button, or you move the mouse pointer around on the mouse pad for a couple of seconds (causing the computer to figure out that the bluetooth device is actually trying to communicate with it.)Besides this, I am very happy with this mouse.  The disadvantages aren't huge, nor will they get in the way of being productive, at least on the Mac side.  ;-)"
3412,Does what it's supposed to do. Worked immediately with all functions for my MacBook Pro.Does go through batteries rather quickly.A very good product. Highly Recommend
3413,"I've been trying to find a BT mouse for a long time that was portable and comfortable so I don't have to use the stupid radio antennas.  I've had several, but they invariably were too small.Pros: The 5000 is almost too small, but actually is pretty comfortable in the hand.  Setup was a little goofy, since I'm use to seeing light on the bottom of the mouse to indicate that it's tracking.  My laptop (Vaio) found and installed it quickly; however, I had to set up in both BT devices and regular devices, since the Vaio only setup in regular devices and it wouldn't work until I setup in BT devices. For some reason the 5000 laser isn't lighting up like other mice, but it still works.  The mouse tracks precisely and well, has 4 buttons, hand sits ergonomically comfortable on it, and so far the laser tracks on all the surfaces I've asked it to do (desk, pad, bed sheet, recliner arm, etc).  I have not seen any lost signal when my laptop goes to sleep, although there is a less than second delay when the mouse power saves, but it is not annoying.  The left and right buttons engage nicely with good tactile feel and click.Cons: The power button on the bottom of the mouse just feels cheap, and initially sliding it on didn't engage all the way.  I tend to have my hand rest forward more on the mouse, so I would prefer the back button on the side to be forward a little; however, this is personal preference since if your hand placement is actually how it should be on the mouse, the button and thumb position is right on.  The biggest annoyance is the track wheel, which is a clicker.  I don't think the clicking accurately scrolls, and would prefer a smooth scrolling wheel.  The scroll wheel as a push button is too easy to push down so the scroll lock engages too easily, which is annoying when I'm only trying to scroll up and down."
3414,"No problems getting it up and running. The variety of buttons was a little daunting, but I quickly got used to it. The software was very helpful in understanding all the options."
3415,"Having had a the MX-1000, I migrated over to the VX nano for the portability aspect and small receiver.  The MX-1000 was just too large and bulky.  Using it with my Macbook Pro, everything was great.  Personally, I enjoy the scroll wheel feature the best.Mac users beware that the logitech software (LCC for logitech control center) is known to cause kernel panics.  For me, it usually occured following waking from sleep and you get this dim screen that tells you to restart your computer by holding down the power key for 2 seconds.  This is fairly well documented on macintouch user experiences.The solution is a third party mouse controller called steermouse that works just fine.  I don't expect logitech to fix this as there have been reports going back to 2004 where logitech's software causes problems with the mac.  Why didn't I have problems with the MX-1000, well its because I never installed logitech's software.  It just worked out of the box.Software aside, the hardware part simply rocks.  I do a fair amount of photoshop and have my MBP attached to an external monitor.  Very fluid and smooth.  Good control and able to ""lasso"" around teeth for whitening with minimal effort.  Only thing better is using a wacom tablet.  Large hands can find the nano too small.If I just rated the hardware, I would give it a 5 -- but since the software caused intermittent kernel panics I'd give the software part a 2.  I gave it a four since I found a third-party solution that works just fine.  Hope you find this helpful!"
3416,I bought this to go with our VIZIO VSB207BT 32-Inch Home Theater Sound Bar and the two sound excellent together!
3417,"For the Company A price of under $1000 this is probably the best receiver in the world under $1K.  Retail is $1600 so it should be pretty great.  I went from a late model Yamaha to this and the difference in sound quality is very noticeable.  This has a much richer and natural sound.  The unit is fairly easy to set.  I did have one problem with my DVR not passing the signal through the receiver regardless of what I tried.  It turned out to be a firmware on the DVR problem but when I called Denon, a knowledgeable technician in the USA answered quickly and was of great help.  That is so rare these days.  So why didn't I give this a 5?  The main touch-screen remote control was designed by somebody that has never actually used a remote - it is next to useless.  Fortunately, Denon includes a secondary remote of a more traditional design that works well.  Also the on-screen user interface is a bit quircky and at times certain selections are difficult to make - you actually have to go one level further down in a menu and then back out to get some of the functions to become selectable even though they should have been up-front.  Once you get past these small issues, this is one great receiver for the money."
3418,"The photos are not accurate.  The Blu-ray emblem is stamped on the case and silver in color.  The center of the disk holder does not have the same push release design.  I also ordered the Double Blu-ray from the same manufacturer (Yens).  They have the push release design, rounded corners, and the raised emblem as the photos.  Except they hold two disks.  I am disappointed the one disk and two disk cases are not the same in design.  Overall they are nice cases, open and close easily, no latches, and snap tight, solid when closed."
3419,"Someone broke into my friend's car, stole his GPS, and left behind a broken window for him to repair. Everyone should get a removable dash pad. Even if you hide your GPS, your permanent dash pad tells the world a GPS might be hiding in your car. The Bracketron dash pad is somewhat large though. If you have a tiny GPS, you might consider buying a smaller dash pad."
3420,"This does everything it claims to do, but just doesn't work with TomTom 920 because of the short mounting neck supplied with the GPS. The short neck doesn't allow the 920 to swivel downward enough to clear the outside of the dash pad. As another reviewer said it's almost parallel with the dash pad. Also the power connector is a right angle toward the pad so that causes further difficulties. I am able to place the pad on a center console/arm rest that allows me to see it very well.The suction cup stays on if you use alcohol wipes on both the dash pad and suction cup."
3421,"Bought this one as an alternative to the overpriced BluRay offerings, and I am not disappointed, especially when I got 10 discs total in the whole package when I bought it.  Tried it out with Blade Runner final cut and was very impressed... picture was excellent on my Sony XBR3 Bravia @ 1080P.  It does a good job upconverting my existing regular DVD discs to 1080P.  Hooking it up and getting it working on my home network for extras and updates had no difficulty.  Startup time is about 30 seconds before it can play a disc.  The optical output on the unit passed DOLBY DIGITAL to my 10 year old Denon AVR without a problem. In fact, the optical output was seperately addressable from the HDMI audio, which was very handy as my older player didn't have that functionality.One thing... get the firmware update for this unit (you can update it via internet) because it fixes startup times and other issues that were identified early on.In all... this is a great value if you want to upgrade to an upconverting player with HI-DEF and start building a library right away.  Even if HDDVD doesn't win the format war eventually, it's a good player regardless because BluRay isn't doing anyone any favors at their prices."
3422,"I had this system unboxed and installed in close to fifteen minutes. The instructions that accompany the device is minimal and I kept looking through the empty cardboard shell for something more. I wanted to know the real specs and the what it was actually promising. My judgment resting on a few snippets printed on the box just wasn't good enough for me, but that's where it left me:CD Quality Sound.Hmmm ... that sounds a lot like 192 kbps if you ask me ... which ain't much. I've stated in reviews before that my wife is intense audiophile and she drools, pavlovian, over stuff like this and while I installed the remote speakers she quickly and deftly installed the transmitter portion behind the stereo cabinet.""Uh ... it's pretty simple, Steffan. Now stop touching stuff!""So that's how it went. She proceeded to run some audio diagnostic tests and made the following comments.""I can usually set the distance in the receiver of each speaker, now the option to do that on the back two channels have disappeared. That's a problem.""""Hmmm. Pink noise on the back two sound weak.""and other gems like: ""CD quality? That's it? Please.""The lack of amplification is pretty obvious as the rear does begin to sound low, especially if you do not have a sixth or seventh channel.The other moment of clarity came when I realized that you're not going to get 'wireless' from this as they have to plug into the wall. For some this may prove a problem depending on your room as you may not have enough power outlets or even have them near without having to run a cord, which defeats the purpose of them being wireless. but that's not really a knock on KEF as it's just a limitation of current technology.I did notice some strange behavior with my Wii remote and also some clicking with our Baby-Monitor as well, but it was minimal. No ""ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch"" every time the cell phones rang or anything like that.The price is what it is and anyone researching wireless systems know that they're going to have to pay money, so knowing this -- I'm not going to make an issue out of it.... ..."
3423,"A good radar detector with an old design, a very old design. Must be careful to distinguish the different models when you purchase one, the latest being ESP. The most advance models allow you to buy a bluetooth adapter to sync with your phone, I strongly recommend that you orient yourself with the YaV1 app which will allow you to significantly reduce false signals and increase the range of the detector. This detector should not be used in states where it is illegal because it can be sniffed out by coppers using a Spectre device (citation will follow). Range is superior to other low end detectors, directional arrows are not a must unless you live somewhere where cops use &#34;sneaky&#34; hiding places to bust speeders.Enjoy"
3424,would give five stars but there is no mount otherwise it falls out. i used velcro now it is ok.
3425,"Good points about this camera:- high res for low price- panoramic feature is cool- colors look great- responsive (seems to start fast without a long delay)- HD video with great colorsNegatives- If you want to take video at 720p, you are limited to 16 minute shots.  I have a 2GB and 4GB card, and with each, it limits you to 16 minutes; must be a file size restriction or something...very annoying.- On some of the videos that I've captured (while using zoom) the video capture slows down and people look like they're in slow motion. :(- NO DOCK!  This wouldn't be so bad except it's really hard to find a dock to buy for it.  I bought one but it doesn't fit firmly on the dock.  :(- I don't know why they went with Quicktime format...my first impression was that the video from my old Casio Exilim was less pixelated.  It may be a higher resolution but some of that effect is taken away by the fact that the compression isn't as good as some other cameras.- The camera interface isn't as intuitive as I hoped it would be.-OverallThis is a very good camera at a great price.  It has great colors and some really neat features.  It's not perfect...but I'd still recommend it."
3426,"This mouse pad has a great surface area, and is very smooth for the mouse.  The resolution pickup is very good for laser mice and I can tell a difference versus the table top or an old mouse pad I had.  The one con mentioned is that it comes rolled up and takes a few days for it to fully relax and lay flat.  This ins't a big deal and is not a deal breaker."
3427,This is an excellent mouse pad. It came rolled up so it is obviously somewhat thin. It is large as mouse pads go. I am not a gamer and use it in my office. It does what a mouse pad is supposed to do and that is move the cursor without fail. I do not know what this material is made of but it it is very effective. My previous mouse pads would on occasion miss a beat or did not have proper contact with the pad. No so with this one. If you have the room for a 12 x 10 pad this one is great.
3428,"Logitech's reputation in computer accessories is long established.  The G9 laser mouse is the latest high end mouse in their product family.  Overall the results are positive.  The good far outweighs the bad here.Installing the mouse is easy and very ""plug and play.""  I've tested the mouse on several systems and had luck getting it to work without the additional software.  If you want to access the customizations and extra features, you will need to install the Setpoint software.  This software draws complaints because of it's limited options and automatic installation of unneeded processes.Customizing the mouse's buttons and creating profiles are both easy.  The limited buttons, including the lack of midline buttons, somewhat limit the number of functions you can add to it.  In addition, there is no left-handed option for this mouse.This mouse's only real competition is the Microsoft Sidewinder gaming mouse.Microsoft SideWinder Gaming MouseThe G9, while not perfect, blows the Sidewinder away with a nicer look, better feel and high-end performance.  As you might expect, it also costs more.Pros:+ The laser mouse and high dpi give you very good accuracy+ The adjustable weights (four 4 gram and four 7 gram) allow you to add or remove weights from an internal tray up to 28 grams, giving you control over the mouse's feel+ The mouse incldes 2 grips to adjust the feel in your hand;  the wide grip is very comfortable and both grips have a nice smooth surface+ You can save up to 5 profiles to the mouse's internal memory; there is a switch on the bottom to choose your profile+ The LED lights on top can be coordinated with your profiles by color and number+ The scroll can be used to ""click"" or ""hyper-scroll"" which allows for normal to superfast page scrolling+ The side buttons provide easy forward/back capabilities for web browsing+ Good for more than just gaming, with enough accuracy for digital inking and graphics applicationsCons:- The mouse is designed for righties only and has no programmable buttons on the opposing side- The corded connection seems out of touch;  a cordless option should be possible at this price point- Logitech's Setpoint software is a problem and is often the source of complaints- The lack of midline buttons and other function keys limits the amount of extra functions- The $100 price is in the range for high end mice, but not a great value in this space- More than 2 grips would have made this mouse much better; this only gives you a wide and a normal gripIf you need a high end mouse for gaming or Company J applications, this one definitely deserves a look.  The adjustable weight, customization features, profiles and performance make this mouse unique among the competition. Enjoy!"
3429,"I had a bunch of different types of hard drives laying around that I wanted to use for various purposes like backing up data temporarily while reloading an operating system, or to store my digital music/movie collection. I wouldn't try to use this for a permanent backup/archive solution because the media is still vulnerable to damage if you don't have it in a case, but for utility purposes this works great."
3430,decent quality hard drive enclosure.not sure why but it takes two usb ports to function properly.maybe that's the requirements for ide hard drives.it's still not convenient.
3431,"I'm not sure why other companies haven't used retractable straps or why this seems like the only bag SOLO makes with it, because it's genius. I travel all the time and have gotten the strap caught on airplane seats, chairs, etc many times.The main compartment is very big - holds my computer PLUS a layer or 2 of notebooks/books, plus the 2 other pocket areas means it holds a lot.Pro:-- Retractable strap is awesome-- A lot of space!!-- Reasonable priceCons:-- The bag is very heavy on its own.-- Main section is not collapsible, making it wider than other bags.-- Have not figured out if it is possible to adjust the strap lengthOverall, worth it."
3432,"I've wanted a GPS for sometime, and was surprised by my wife for our anniversary with the nuvi 260. My requirements for a GPS were pretty minimal, but I'm glad my wife bought this one.Pros:- It does actually have the voice that indicates when and where to turn. Very handy versus having to look at the screen- Nice and portable, I love being able to bring it with me in different cars. It was fun, we did take it on a train ride, and it even was able to track us on the railroad.- Fairly decent maps - I've had very few issues locating a place. There were a few instances, but I'll go into those later.- Menu system works well -  Everything is pretty straightforward. It isn't difficult even to type in a specific address. The GPS usually picks it up quite quickly, and provides you with the various options it could be for your selection.- Remembers recent locations/items- Does have an expansion slot to view photos, etc. Not a big deal for me, but is a nice advantage- If you take a wrong turn, etc. it picks right up and tells you where to go to compensate.Cons:- It can take FOREVER sometimes to acquire the satellite signals. Sometimes I type in an address, and I could be halfway to the location before it picks up the signal. This is very frustrating, especially when the destination is one that I'm not at all sure where it is. For those destinations that I know the general area, it's not too bad.- I realize the maps are outdated (although the copyright for the software is 2008 on the GPS), but some of the restaurant locations I've tried going to were completely wrong. For my anniversary, for instance, we were trying to find the local Dairy Queen. It also listed a separate restaurant option called Dairy Keen. Turns out, there has never been a Dairy Queen in the city. Not sure how the GPS had that. Incidents like this have happened on several occasions.In the end, I'm still very satisfied with the unit. I'm glad I have it, and really have no reason to look at getting another. It does all I've ever needed in a GPS."
3433,"This battery (NP-50) is the same one, that came with my Fuji F80EXR camera...There are cheaper batteries out there, but these have, much less capacity (camera operating time (pictures per charge).Its has two different description of the capacity (on the battery):940mAh 3.4Wh3.6V 1000mAMy final thoughts:That a lot of juice, in a small space...Fuji claims, 230 pictures per charge, ether the battery capacity is too low, or the camera sucks, too much juice (my last camera, EX-Z600 was 1000 pics per charge).Or they got what they wanted, as I purchased several extra batteries..."
3434,im happy but not very happy. it works great in pc but not work in ps3.  but im happy after all
3435,"I've had this mouse over a month now and no complaints.  It works like a mouse should and does not have that stick plugged in to a USB port on the back of my computer like other wireless mice do.  It is very accurate and also doesn't have the red laser light on the bottom.The drawbacks if any are: 1: It seems to hesitate a second when you haven't used it for awhile.  Kind of like it went to sleep and when you move it, it has to wake up. 2. I also run Sun Solaris and it will not work with that operating system.  I believe that is a Solaris thing more than a mouse thing.  Lack of driver...Over all I like it; it has a good feel, and shape.  It is small without being to small.  I would buy it again.I've now had it a couple years and the PC I had with Bluetooth is long gone.  I did get a Mac recently that has Bluetooth so I got this mouse out and put new batteries in it and pared it to the Mac.  It worked, sort of.  I used it for maybe two weeks and was having a lot of problems with my Mac.  Crazy mouse, rebooting and sometimes the mouse just would not work unless I rebooted.  I finally gave up and got a small Logitech M305 and it works fantastic with my Mac.I would not get this mouse if you are running anything other than a PC with Windows and the PC came with Bluetooth build in.  Get the M305 instead."
3436,"What else can I say. You can go to an Apple store and try it out.Bought mine because my previous one broke.The plus of those keyboards are:- They are very sturdy- Very elegant and nice looking- Easy to keep it clean, as there are no large gaps where dirt can go and they can be cleaned easily (I even read a story of some guy that put it inside his dishwasher!)- Integrated USB hub with two extra ports so you don't lose a port on your computerUnfortunately they also have some down side:- The keyboard is all glued in one big piece (no screws to hold it together): if you want to open it (any reason), you're in no luck. If the keyboard stop working, you don't try to fix it: you replace it (and this is quite bad).- The USB sockets available are facing the side of the keyboard: so when you plug in a non-Apple mouse on the right socket, the mouse plug and the cable sticks out and force you to keep the mouse more far away (the keyboard was designed to work well with Apple mouse that has a much smaller USB connector and shorter cable).When I purchased mine from Company A the keyboard had a very weird defect: the LEFT cursor key would stuck if you press it multiple times very fast. I.e. you press it fast 10 times, the computer will register being pressed 3-4 times only (events key up/down), and the rest would register it as being continuously pressed.So, when you work with an editor, moving to the RIGHT sometimes would cause the cursor to start moving without your intention... Games were out of the question... I think it was the key switch that was defective, but again, being all glued up together, you can't open it.Keyboard was brand new so Company A exchanged it for free. The replacement works like a charm."
3437,"It was longer than I needed, I've had it for a while, it seems to work fine.  It's thin, the covering near the connector has torn and I'll have to tape it soon.  The plug is easy to plug and unplug.  Best of all, I got it dirt cheap."
3438,"This came to me exactly as pictured. Seems to be good quality at a good price. The cable comes slightly stiff but they all do. It has worked great since I got it. No packet loss, no connection issues. Good buy!"
3439,"I tested a lot of docks before choosing one. I Loved one by Sony, but was blown away when I heard the Bose sound. It was my first ever Bose system, and have purchased sound air and sound link since I bought this. First thing I noticed was I enjoy how the lyrics come through the system. It also can get real loud great for small parties. Bose support is great, and will help you fix issues with the unit if need be. Overall I've used this dock every day, and its holding up well."
3440,"I confess, I am a electronic consumer nut. After ""getting by"" on SVHS and component hookups for my electronic equipment, I bit the bullet and started looking for a receiver that had enough HDMI inputs, enough SVHS inputs, an input for my iPod and RCA-phono/USB-phono, LAN and computer.  Previously, I had a Pioneer VSX-9500, then a Yamaha model with about 5 SVHS inputs, and a Denon AVR 4802R with 7 SVHS inputs.  After a couple of months of searching through the usual suspects, including the other brands I have had, I settled on the Yamaha RX-V3800 in black because it allowed me to do enough of what I wanted to do from my shopping list I mentiond earlier.First of all, I was surprised to find that all the receivers I looked at had downsized their number of connections from four years ago when I bought my Denon receiver.  I was having to look at receivers costing 2 to 3 times as much as the RX-V3800 before I could find one with as many inputs, and I found even Yamaha's RX-Z11 had the same number as the RX-V3800, and it ran almost $5,000.00. Then, I thought about it... what were the inputs I really used most of all:  SVHS, BluRay, HD-DVD, DVR, DVR-VHS combo, CD player, cassette, and phono.  There was one input remaining that I was able to use with a junction box for ED-Beta,Laser Disc, XM radio, and an DVR-R recorder, so the Yamaha RX-V3800 would do without me having to compromise too much.But, let's get to the machine and all of it's pluses:The sound... It is terrific!  With my previous system, I had to gerry-rig the side speakers using a quadraphonic synthesizer, but the RX-V3800 has the following speaker connections:  left-front, right-front, center, left-side, right-side, left-rear, right-rear and sub-woofer.  My previous set-up had a rear-center, and after reading a little, I found you could hook-up a rear center by using the RCA connection labeled ""Single (SB).""  (There's a ""SURBACK PRESENCE"" that can be used, also, but it was designed for when you only wanted one rear channel). When you set-up the speakers, Yamaha has a special optimizer microphone you plug into the front of the unit and it balances your speakers based on where you have the microphone placed.The four HDMI inputs are great, too, because it allows me to have the best picture and sound from my BluRay, HD-DVD, Satellite Receiver, and DVR-VHS unit.The Internet radio is easy to use, and it is programmed with plenty of stations.  The selection of stations with the Yamaha remote is easy and the sound is wonderful.The iPod Yamaha YDS-10 dock option is a must if you have an iPod.  Quite frankly, I probably won't use my phono, now, except to make digital recordings of out-of-date vinyl recordings because of the ease of operation of the iPod through the docking station, especially if you have the 80 or 160 GB model of iPod with all the music they can hold.The XM set-up with the XM Extreme is nice and integrates smoothly.  I, actually, use an older XM radio through two RCA inputs, but with the XM Extreme directly connected, it is easier to use.The computer set-up is not as easy as the manual would make you believe, but it is easier if you do the following:  Make sure your PC has XP Service Pack Two or Vista on it AND you have Windows Media Player 11 installed, have your 232 Serial Ports between the computer and the Yamaha RX-V-3800 connected, and have a networking guide for your operating system.  Once you have those done, you go into Windows Media Player, select ""Library"" at the top, and then select ""Media Sharing"" to allow the tunes on your PC to be shared with your receiver.  For other PC's on your LAN, it would be best for you to already have those tunes shared, but if you connect an iPod, that might not be necessary.  While I am at it, I will say this about Media Player ll: once you've checked the right boxes, it does a good job.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Yamaha RX-V3800.  I did think that they could have done a better job with the manual... for example, in setting-up the PC, you start reading the instructions and it refers you to two other sections of the manual, and when things just didn't seem to jell, one finds that later in the manual, they show you how to do the set-up more thoroughly and manually, if needed.  That said and done, though, I would buy this receiver again.  I do wish it had more inputs, but then again, most people don't have as much to hook-up as I do.  If there were a four-and-a-half stars rating, I would give it, but I'm stuck giving it only four.UPDATE:  It is two months after first doing this review, and I still love this receiver.  I bought a great pair of outside speakers that look like rocks,HiFi Works 30020 HFW 6.5-Inch Rock Speakers (Pair), and use the ""Room 2"" with the X-10 Powermid remote extender,X10 POWERMID Remote Control Extender Kit PM5900.  This set-up is wonderful!  I sometimes have the iPod play outside, while inside they are watching TV on the HDTV.  One caution, when setting-up the ""Room 2,"" it will ask you what is the initial volume you want the ""room"" to have.  I had not paid that much attention to those dB settings on the volume you get across the screen of the TV, and the first time I used Room 2, you could hear the music over a block away...  Those speakers didn't flinch and their tone was terrific!  (Unfortunately, our house was so sound proof, I didn't know I was blowing-out the neighbors.) Using the X-10 remote control extenders really is a blessing.  If you use the extenders in other areas of the house, be sure to have your remote receiver up close to the Yamaha."
3441,I have had this lens for over a year now and have nothing bad to say about it. It shoots everything within flash range well and I use it for landscapes quite often.
3442,"I needed a long stereo cable so got this one because it was cheap.  This cable works great for me, but be aware the it is not heavy duty.  Thin covering and probably thin wire is what made this cable so cheap.  I have the wire set and don't touch it so that is fine for me.  If you need to constantly work with the cable it might be better if you get a better cable."
3443,Had a tight case fit and needed a 90deg connector. These cables worked just as offered and I've not had any issues with them.
3444,"Has a lot of great functions for the price. It does feel a little too light if you know what I mean, but I haven't had any issues with it's durability after 6 months."
3445,"I'm using this for audio out to a stereo system.  Everything worked fine right out the box.  I get good, clear sound, and adequate volume.  The remote works well, but has a few design issues I cover below.  The remote worked well from a distance of 15-20 feet.  Being RF, it does not have to point at the dock, and I could control my iPod from around corners and through walls.  I did not try the RF over longer distances, so it may have a greater range.  I don't have it hooked to a TV or PC so I can't comment on those functions.The design of the remote is only thing keeping this from being 5 stars.  It feels a bit chintzy.  It's very small, light, and easy to lose.  I wish they had put a loop on it so you could attach a cord or something.  Also, the buttons are labelled with symbols that are indented into them.  Since the buttons are a dark grey, it is difficult to read the symbols in anything other than good lighting (at least for my 49 year old eyes).  Finally, it is not clear how to replace the remote battery, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.I would buy this again and would recommend it to a friend.--Eric"
3446,"Pro- fairly lightweight- get new angles your arms cannot reach- great for GoPros.- adjustable length- easily pack awayCons- Angled  tripod mount never fully locks in. theres a slight slack- the telescoping post also has some slack due to its construction. its feels like a cheap antenna- the slack in the telescope and tripod mount translates to unnecessary vibration sounds like clicks or taps.- i wouldnt put a point and shoot on this as its not very solidThe extender gets the job done, but the build quality restricts certain usage, esp if you need sound. If you only do photos or videos with music dubbed over, the clicks and jiggles should not be a problem. Twisting right to left during filming video will exaggerate the jiggles and vibration sounds since its not very solid. If you think about it, this is just a glorified antenna with a tripod mount. Although i think antennas are better built."
3447,"I ordered the Nikon MB-D10 Battery Grip only a few days ago from Company A, and received the order last night.  Shipping was fast and worry free.  As far as the product goes, it provides a great addition to the Nikon D300 camera.  Very easy to install the battery and attach to the camera itself.  It provides much more surface area to hold on to the camera and feels great in your hands.  The one downfall of the Battery Grip is that it only holds one battery; not two batteries like most other battery grips that I've used (i.e. Canon).  Granted, you can either use the Nikon battery in the grip or use eight double-A batteries, but the battery grip does not allow to use two Nikon batteries simultaneously.  Other than that, I'd rate the item a 5!"
3448,"I've own this product for almost 3 weeks now and I've been happy with it.  You hear all this stuff about audio limitation and it's true.  It's quite annoying only hearing 2 channel on a ""TrueHD"" disc.  But if you have a capable AVR, you can basically matrix the 2 channel into 5 channels and have a temporary audio solution until a firmware is out to fix it.  It's not guaranteed that the ""May firmware"" will fix this audio issue, but there have been rumors that should at least pass-through for next gen audio.Video-wise, the REON chip is absolutely amazing at upconverting standard DVDs, but of course it depends on the movie itself.  Most newer movies have better quality to start with so with the upconversion, pictures look nearly HD on a 52"" LCD.  For a 32"", I can barely tell any difference at all between HD vs. upconversion.  Without saying much, it's a given that the HD DVD and Blu-ray video qualities are stunning.  Upconversion of DVD-wise for the equipment I own, I would rank the BD-UP5000 first, then LG-BH200, HD-A35, HD-A2, and finally PS3.I currently own a November 2007 build with firmware 1.2 and so far, I haven't had any problems with either HD DVDs nor bluray, except for imported HD DVDs such as T2 Ultimate Edition.  But then again, it's not great to use that as a point of reference due to T2 Ultimate Edition using Dynamic HDi, which is a much more complicated menu system that is linked to web-accessible material.If Samsung can really release a May firmware that fixes any audio issues and enabling next-gen audio pass-through, this would be an absolute 5-star product."
3449,"The mouse is flat but no uncomfortable. The USb adapter is small. The scroll ball is no better than a scroll wheel (I bid not install the Kensington driver). The mouse is glossy and a little slipery, so I put vinyl paper over the buttons. The remote control part works good, but is difficult not to press the buttons on the other side."
3450,"Cable is as advertised with good quality ends. Cord is not stiff. Hooked it up to my Nokia C2-01.5 and transfered some photos to my PC. Worked fine. Battery started charging but I unhooked it once transfers were through as I am not a fan of quick charging.Only negative is that the plastic surrounding the 'mini' end is a bit large. If your mini plug on your device is inset at all or if the flap is particularly thick and can not be moved completely out of the way, the mini plug may not go all the way in. If your mini plug hole is flush with the side of the device, you will have no problem."
3451,"My wife can sleep wait I watch the television. They are great for the price. You can use them with the earphone connect too and on PC, and iPhone."
3452,"I like that you can plug an SD card into it and it knows what to do. I also like the wood frame and matte. What I would like to see improved is that some pictures that display fine on my computer don't come through (maybe one out of every 50); instead, you see random color bars similar to a TV station that is off the air (for those of you old enough to remember that!). And if you want it to play music, you'll have to convert the music to WMA format which no one I know uses except maybe Bill Gates."
3453,"I've tried everything to get great ""3d"" sound at a reasonable price.  Sound bars, soundprocessors-----unless you surround yourself with speakers, you might as well just get two really nice ones that simply offer high quality stereo.That's what these have achieved.  Small, almost invisible in the dark, and best of all---you can plug them in to the tv's headphone jack----and then control the volume thru the tv.I'd buy these again.  There's no way that bose is any better, and these are a small fraction of the price."
3454,"I purchased this over two weeks ago at Best Buy, here in Los Angeles for $599.99! Yes folks, thanks to Best Buy's notorious price difference on the web and in their infamous intranet, I made them honor what I saw at home on my computer! And yes, this was for the TomTom 920T!It is slimmer, lighter, nicer and loaded with more features than any other portable GPS device in the market! Functions within the TomTom 920T are very similar to other models. I upgraded from the 910 and did notice some very good changes in its software, and in its ability to do a bit more configuration than on the TomTom 910.One of the things that I like the most, aside from its new redesigned shape was its ability to search for different POI's (Points Of Interest) with better matching results while at the same time providing you a lot of additional information, such as distance, physical address, map overview, phone number (if available) and yes, the ability to dial it directly.By the way, this is something that Garmin GPS devices have always been able to do, including searching restaurants by food type, e.g. Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc. With the exception of this last search feature, I do believe that the new TomTom takes it one step further, which is good.This upgraded feature is very important, because as most TomTom users know, previous versions of TomTom POI search, would just result in a long list of POI's matching what ever you input and nothing more. For example, if you typed Best Buy, you would get a list of all Best Buy stores in the county, but without any distance information, map preview, address or phone number!This would obviously force you to route each resulting POI one by one, until you finally obtained the one that you really wanted, which was a waste of time! Well, not any more and I am very glad that TomTom made this very necessary upgrade!Here is a list of things that I noticed:The light sensor gone from the top and now sitting very discreetly in the front.The remote control has been improved and is now Bluetooth.It seems to me that it is somewhat faster in performing any commands faster than its predecessor.Accepting spoken directions is a plus and has worked well for me so far, no complaints.The screen is huge and seems to have been improved, because I now can see everything much better than on the previous model in bright sunny days.The speaker sounds fragile with the default voice, compared to the 910, but sounds much better with a human voice and the music sounds great!You can now hear all instructions through your car speakers by tuning it to an empty radio station. I tried it, but did not like it at all, too much static and sound is extremely low, could be because I live in downtown Los Angeles.The included RF transmitter is a winner, it is very accurate in obtaining traffic data and I notice that it does so upon turning it on and it updates itself periodically as I am driving. However, it would have been better if they would have built it into the unit in order to avoid another wire from hanging from the unit.Phone integration is great and fast, the sound quality is very good and I have been told by people who I call that it sounds very good. I make and receive between 200 to 300 calls a day, so this is a plus! Unfortunately, it does not sync well with my Palm Treo 750, so I miss out on many other TomTom extra features that requre my cell phone in order to be able to obtain data, such as weather information, map downloads, gas prices, etc.I also do notice that its ability not to lose signal is improved, which is good, since as I have already mentioned, I live in downtown LA.The included software is also great and much better than previous versions of TomTom Home.What's in the box? The TomTom 910, the RF transmitter, car charger, windshield cradle, desktop cradle, remote control, software and manuals.All in all it is a great GPS unit, very nicely and intelligently designed and the only reason I do not give it a 5 is because of the use of an external RF transmitter, instead of a built in one and lack of important travelling tools, such as those found in several of the Garmin units.I feel that TomTom, given their current market share and being so strong in Europe should include different measurement and currency conversion tools, as well as a different language translator and a virtual tour guide program similar to those found in several of the Garmin units.This thing fits in the pocket of your shirt! If I were sightseeing in France, I would want to have access to these types of tools!However, to be fair, the new TomTom 920T does include a several great features not found in other units, specifically the Help Me feature which, will assist you in many emergencies such as in letting you know where you are, instruct you where to walk to your closest emergency assistance point or even guide you in applying first aid!I highly recommended to anyone and I do hope that TomTom will improve their already magnificent product with the suggestions that I have made, maybe one day TomTom will team up with Google and provide similar information as MSN does for the Garmin NUVI."
3455,"Everything works well. It was easy to install my drive into. I have only one complaint. It does not automatically turn the hard drive off. I was hoping it would, but the drive constantly spins. So when I have scheduled to do an auto backup, I must turn the drive on and off when it is done. Its not a big deal, but still.The blue light might be bright for some because it is constantly on when the drive is powered up. There is a red led the flickers when it is reading/writing the drive, so it turns the light a faint purple. A nice change from the single blue led."
3456,"Aesthetically, this is a really nice product from Samsung.  The player is quite sleek, with nice rounded edges, a decent weight, and sharp piano black gloss finish.  The sound quality is superb.  I didn't get the same battery life the manufacturer did (they rate 30 hours, I probably average 20), but I would bet that's because I use the touchscreen interface more than their battery testers did.As for the touchscreen, I have to admit it's pretty nice.  I prefer tactile use, so I'm more of a fan of buttons than touchscreens, but Samsung has done a nice job executing this one.  There are a couple of odd quirks to the touchscreen.  For example, when you ""swipe"" the touchscreen to advance you have to swipe from right to left, which seems counterintuitive since you are advancing the progress bar from left to right.  Obviously, the same is true of swiping to back up, where you swipe from left to right, even though you're going back on the progress bar.Also, in the default menu setting, you make circular gestures on the touchscreen to advance through the menu.  Neat? yes.  Functional? not really.  The biggest problem I had with this is that my thumb kept obscuring the icons as they moved into view.  Ultimately, I found this too annoying and I disabled it in favor of a regular grid menu.  Not as cool to show your friends, but much more functional.The audio player functions are top notch.  As a caveat to this, I will say that I could not get this to sync with Winamp 5.5.  My Winamp crashed every time I loaded it when the P2 was plugged in.  Instead, I did my syncing through Windows Media Player, and it worked fine.  It synced playlists perfectly, and did a great job recognizing albums when I copied them directly like a mass storage device.  The on-board player functions include a customizable EQ with quite a few presets and a clarity adjuster.  There are preset visualizations including a couple of light shows (that do not track the music), album art, track info, and a spectrum analyzer.The video player is pretty good, but I don't really like watching video on such a small screen anyway.  I'm not a big fan of the fact that you have to convert through Samsung's software to get it to run, but I guess that's the case with most MP3/video players.  The widescreen playback is properly formated.  FM reception is satisfactory.  Not sure how the eReader works since I don't have any ebooks for it, but you can see test screens of it.This is, overall, a good MP3 player, even if it is a bit pricey.  It is only $50 cheaper than the iTouch, but it also brings in an FM radio tuner and bluetooth support for up to two bluetooth devices--including a pass-thru for your cellphone to a set of bluetooth stereo headphones like the non-US release Samsung T9.  Bluetooth is a great feature if you've got bluetooth headsets, speakers, or car radio.  So you're getting more features than the iTouch offers.  A major downside for me is the fact that it is primarily touchscreen-only (there are hard buttons on the side: on the left a lock button and a play/pause/power button; on the right, two volume buttons).  Since I tend to like to keep my mp3 in my pocket, I prefer to have tactile skip buttons as well.Samsung has made some great strides with their feature packed MP3 players.  And while this one was almost perfect for me, it fell short of the mark only in the somewhat high price tag and the lack of hard skip buttons.  I give them kudos, however, for having hard play/pause/power and volume buttons (FYI, play/pause and volume can also be controlled via the touchscreen)."
3457,"The mouse is of great quality, very well built. And it is very small as advertised/expected. The wheel is of great quality also. My only gripe is that the clicks sound are too loud, other than that great mouse that won't let you down."
3458,"I love this, it works great. The vertical shutter is very nice, but I feel as if it may be a little slower than the shutter on the camera, I'm not sure.  I shot a wedding with it last night. I love the professional look it has, sets your camera different from all the rest. My arm is sore though, it is heavier but I'm sure I will get used to it.  I am very happy with the grip."
3459,This works great on my first gen and my zune hd. Also broadcasts better than the other style that plugs into the headphone jack.
3460,"These cables are great but not excellent. The rubber made from the material are not of great in quality and I was hoping for a terminal plastic protection that did not arrived for each unit. Either way, if you understand that this is a backup for your Zune will be just fine to have it."
3461,I used this memory for my phone. It was nice that an adapter was included so that I could use it in my desktop computer. The speed is reasonable and quick enough for my device.
3462,"For a miniature storage device, it does the job to hold a lot of data.  Too bad prices are not coming down faster than magnetic media."
3463,"it has a good grip to it, but the fit is a bit off.  no biggie i guess right for this price..."
3464,"I am using the apple remote with my Mac Mini that is hooked up to our TV (i.e., set up as a home theater PC).  In terms of connectivity, it works better than I expected.  Even though it uses infrared, I feel like I don't have to have line-of-sight to get the signal to the Mac.  I am using it to control iTunes and iDVD.I'd give it a 5-star rating except that the reverse button is touchy.  When watching a DVD, I like to scan back to hear some dialog that I missed.  To do that, you have to press and hold.  However, it often just jumps back to the beginning of the chapter (which is extremely annoying).  It's only supposed to jump back if you click the button (i.e., press and release).  So that touchiness is a problem, but other than that it's a great product."
3465,"This device works well, but the CF card does not go all the way in. I was hoping to leave it in for automated document backups."
3466,Gives a great range improvement over some of the smaller USB adapters.  The only negative is that the breadth of it makes it difficult to use a USB port on either side of it.  That is why I deducted a star.  Other than that is great.
3467,"I have small ears so I have a hard time finding headphones that don't make my ears sore and these don't. Compared to my old ones like this that were an offbrand these have great sound quality and are super durable, I've stepped on them thrown them around all kinds of stuff and they're still holding up. They're very universal too, they work well for my computer and for my iPod. They're very light weight and the pink is very vibrant so I have a hard time losing them. It's great."
3468,"I liked it, I had 2 of them, eventually they break inside the cord or something, but while it worked it was good, if you use it occasionally with a notebook, it's good, but not for daily use. I am sure that neither of mine came with a pouch, so I am not quite sure that this one will either.They were cheap, small and that's why I bought another after the first one broke.  Use it  until it breaks, because for the smallness, you'll love it.  I never had a problem with it not retracting."
3469,"Having Never owned a MP3 player before I don't have anything to really compare it to, but I'm pretty happy with the Zune. There are some things the prevent it from being perfect in my mind, but it is well worth the money and works real well for music. For the most part I'm impressed.I did a lot of research before buying an MP3 player and decided on the Zune for a few reasons. Some of these reasons turned out not to be as important as I thought and others didn't work right out of the box, but a couple of them are really impressive. I was really intrigued by the Automatic Wireless syncing, but to do this you'll need to buy a separate AC power cable. You can still sync wirelessly by going to the menu on the Zune, but this uses up a lot of batteries and the only included way to charge it is with the USB cable. So, unless you're going to go out and buy the power cable you don't really get wireless syncing. Another thing that was advertised was syncing with your recorded windows media TV shows. I've tried setting this up, but I couldn't figure out an easy way to do it in the Zune Program. It could still be possible but, if it is it isn't as simple as syncing with your music collection. The one feature that really works and sold me on the device is the Zune pad. I tried it out in the store and it is even better in practice. It is really easy to scroll though the long lists of artist/albums/songs on the Zune.The Zune player itself seems pretty well built. Its small and light weight. The screen looks beautiful for the album art and for pictures. Video looks good too, but it is a little small. The Zune Pad that I mentioned before is a great feature. You can brush the pad to scroll through music and change the volume. It also responds to pressing it like a button. Overall the Unit is pretty nice. Battery life is good enough from my experience, I've never ran out of power when I needed it. However, like I mentioned before I don't have anything to compare it too.The software, though downloaded separately is a pretty big portion of this player and, thankfully, it works real well. When you first load it up it should be able to find all the music and photos and videos, unless you store them in a weird place. If thats the case you'll have to tell the program where your media is before it will find it. Syncing is painless and you can set it up to sync all your media, or just your music, or specific items. There are a lot of options for what to sync and what not to. Using the software is pretty intuitive and I doubt any one would have trouble getting acclimated to it. The Zune Store isn't too bad either. It uses Microsoft Points, which is 80 points per dollar and is the biggest downside, but the quality of the music is better than the music from iTunes. There isn't as much selection as iTunes, but for me most of my favorite music was there. You can actually download the software and give it a try without buying a Zune, which is something I recommend doing.There is also a social aspect to the Zune, but I wont go into it much. Right now it consists of a Zune Card that shows what songs you've played and a friends list where you can track the plays of your friends. Right now it can only be accessed by going to zune.net. Unless you have a lot of friends who also have a zune, I don't see this being very useful.Overall, the Zune if very functional and fun. Although it didn't live up to all my expectations, I am still very happy. The Zune is a great looking very fun portable music player and I would encourage people  to give it some consideration for their next MP3 player purchase. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3470,"I purchased several ram mounts for adding accessories to my Gold Wing trike. This double ball mount allows me to have a drink holder on one ball mount and a camera, GPS, or radar detector on the other. Comes complete with necessary hardware for mounting to your brake or clutch bracket. Includes both metric & SAE screws."
3471,"I've been using the iTrip for a while and it definitely is an improvement over past FM transmitters that I've used.  The cord length does the job and is long enough to allow me to keep the cord docked in my center console in the car.  This is nice as I can easily throw the cord back into the console when it's not in use.I have to say that the tune scan is pretty much worthless however.  I let it try to pick out 3 stations that would work and all three were pretty miserable in quality.  That being said, I had much better luck just tuning my radio to the the low end frequencies until I got static and using that station.  There was a little bit of practice to get the exact right station but once I got it, it was worth it.  There's a little bit of hiss but then again, it's FM radio.  Unless the manufacturers can pump up the amps on these things, I'm sure we're always going to have some hissing.  At least I can find a small zone where there is no radio playing to I can listen to my iPhone.  (yes, it works with my iPhone just fine)"
3472,I have the case for a few months now. The cover on the face side started to wear off at the place where the velcro is attached. And the whole case just is not that tight anymore. My ipod slides out sometimes when I open the case.
3473,"I'm very fond of this device. It's more comfortable than using the keyboard because I can keep my arm at my side with a natural angle, like using a mouse. It fits my smallish hand very well and I have more keys within easy reach. I use it with a WASD type arrangement and don't use the thumb pad for movement. I removed the hat and just use it as four more keys I can map.The software UI isn't very good but it gets the job done. If you are a novice computer use you may find it confusing but I doubt anyone buying a dedicated gaming peripheral will have much of a problem figuring it out. A very nice feature is that the configuration is stored on the device. You can bring it to another computer or reinstall your OS and not have to reconfigure it.My complaints are minor. I'd like the keys to have more of a positive indent. They are kind of mushy. The bright LED is ridiculous. I taped over it.I also have a Logitech G13 but the Belkin is the one I prefer. The Logitech has more keys but they are a stretch for my hand. The Logitech's thumb stick is better for movement but not to map as individual keys like I prefer. Most importantly, the Belkin is more comfortable. It supports all the weight of my hand and just my fingers extend. The Logitech requires me to support the weight of my hand.In the Logitech's favor the software is much better and the LCD screen is very cool.My first recommendation is to get some sort of gamepad. They're great. It'll be personal preference which one you find more comfortable."
3474,"Like many others, we struggled keeping the iPhone headphones in our ears during any kind of activity or motion.  The V-Moda headphones were a great replacement.  While not inexpensive, the headphones are sleek and come with two sets of ear buds.  The reception quality is great for phone calls and the music/podcasts sound so much better.  Oh, and they stay in your ears!The only drawback is the call button is quite a bit bigger and heavier than the iPhone headphones.  But that's only because we got used the original iPhone headphones' call button."
3475,"Came before expected and packaging was perfect. I didn't expect it to come with a tool to help wrap around the cables. And frankly, that disappointed - or I'm not good at understanding the pictures. So I put it on by hand, which is what I'd planned to do anyway. Wow! What a difference. That spider web of cables is contained and not at all the mess it had been. 16 feet is way more than I needed. I'd hoped I could cut it and I was right. So now, if I can force myself to move the TV etc out from the wall, I can get rid of that mass of wire, too. Great product."
3476,we installed a 22&#34; flat screen combo tv in our travel trailer master bedroom and it work great might get another one for the living room.
3477,"I have the Sportster5 for nearly a year and it worked fine until it started to indicate antenna not detected just recently for some reason, luckily  I kept my starmate which worked without any problems for nearly 2 years, I have to swap back to the Starmate to continue listening, another issue I have with sirius is when I swapped from the Starmate to the Sportster last year(08)it was free to swap but now, they charge an extra $15 to do a swap, buncha rip offs."
3478,"I purchased the Sony 505 before the release of the current PRS-300/600 mainly as a experiment to see if I would enjoy reading material electronically.  So far so good. The e-Ink is easy on the eyes. Much has been said about the reading material available for the PRS 505.  I have found no shortage of material, especially once I found ""calibre"".  I am able to download news from various  news papers and magazines, enough to satisfy my needs.  There are a number of websites that provide public domain books free of charge ([...]is the best of the lot).  And yes, I have purchased books from Sony eStore and and other eBook Stores.  Sony, with its latest version of the eReader Software (3.0) has made it compatible with MAC users.  Synching the reader with your MAC or PC is easy.  I highly recommend the ""Custom Cover and Light"" from Sony.  It has proven to be a valuable tool for late night reading.  I rated the eReader 4 stars mainly because it is missing some items that are available in the PRS-600, touch screen, note taking, highlighting and the 505 page turning lags a little occasionally.  Other than that the eReaders from Sony are great.  The conversion of Sony material to ePUB formats is a real plus.  The Sony's ability to read multiple formats is it's greatest strength.  The eReader world needs to settle on a standard and ePUB from Adobe could easily be that standard.  If you are wondering about eReaders, now may be the time to buy, the prices on the 505s are coming down on left over eReaders and you may still be able to locate one (PRS-505).  I am waiting on the ""Daily Edition"" from Sony before I make a decision on which model to upgrade to as my next reader."
3479,"This adapter is a nice item to have, and it has good adjustability, good fit, and good overall features. But that is also its main problem: it is only just ""good"". It fits into deep cupholders nicely, but it could fit better, especially in its ability to maintain a very tight fit. It has some movement to adjust around, but even that is limited to a few optimal positions. And the arm could be longer, which would help the positioning, however I can see that that might increase any instability. But overall, I like it and it does work, but I would suggest looking at several options before buying. For me in my vehicle, it does a pretty good job and I like it. It was worth the money. For others, maybe not so much. Get it if it suits your needs."
3480,"These were comfortable earphones that had good quality at a good price. Compared to other earphones, this one had a little ""muffled"" sound which suits me fine since I'm not a fan for high-pitched treble. They fit good and the idea of the double jack is good for those especially with an ipod touch since you will have the ipod close to you without a hanging cord. But, sadly, I lost mine and bought the new apple in-ear headphones."
3481,"Did my first Flat Panel install and this mount made it easy like Sunday morning, (Yes, I installed it on a Sunday morning in less than an 1 hour. The hardware seemed a little cheap, but there was more than enough to install my TV and a few more if needed."
3482,strong and sturdy. Only negative I have found with it is you have to use the &#34;wrench&#34; that comes in the box to get the thing mounted to the wall. A regular wrench will not fit past some of the hardware to screw it tight against wall.
3483,"I bought this power supply for a new build computer based on Corsair's reputation for making fine computer products and I am very satisfied with its performance.  It comes with more than enough connectors for any computer you might build and the cables are long enough to reach any corner of my very large, full tower, Coolermaster case.  The 140mm fan is extremely quiet which was one of my biggest concerns when buying a new power supply.  I only wish it were modular in design so I wouldn't have a bundle of wires I didn't use but had to wrap up and stuff in the corner and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
3484,"Protect your Ipod, Mines in my jeep..this protects it from the rumblin around when i'm driving..i live it ruff soo get one!!"
3485,I used this below my newly acquired swivel TV wall mount. I had the TV mounted in the corner of the room and was looking for something to place the cable box on. This is nice because the arms can be pulled forward and back to adjust to the width of what its holding. It was easy to install and matched nicely with the cable box and TV/TV wall mount.
3486,Got this one because of the style and two because it was so darn cheap. Looking at this image though I'm noticing I did NOT receive what was pictured... It kind of has a weird design and there is a hole at the top of the case which I'm not sure what the point of it is. Besides that annoying fact it works well.
3487,"Purchased for a health-related monitor, it was not included in the original package.  However, it is indispensable for proper operation of said product.Good cable, does what you expect it to do,  Saves having to type in a bunch of data so you can people your database with numbers without a lot of work."
3488,I like the Ibiza so far. The wireless feature in it is crap though. Do not buy this player for its internet capabilities. everything else works fine and dandy. The Rhapsody feature is really nice. When you first get the player you get a one month free trial period and then its 10 bucks a month if you still want it. Another thing i noticed is that the menus tend to lag or take a long time to go to another screen. Like when you change volume it takes the player a little while to actually do it. One more thing that annoyed me is that the battery bar on the bottom always keep changing. One minute it shows me it has one bar then the next minute i have three bars and then after that i have two bars. Other than that i really like this mp3 player because it does what it's supposed to.Oh and the video feature from AOL is discontinued so you can't really stream videos anymore from online. You can still downlload videos and watch them.
3489,This item was the only one I found with a VGA input.I used this box to connect a coaxial cable line to it and the VGA OUT to an old computer monitor (screen) I had.Works as advertised. But I received a white box! Not a black box that was advertised! BUT IT WORKS GREAT SO I'M HAPPY!Con: The material feels cheap.Pros: Lightweight and comes with remote
3490,"First of all, you should know that I own a Nokia N800 - not the N810.  I encourage you to read my review of the N800 for more information on that device.The N800 is identical to the N810 with only two exceptions.  The N810 has a GPS receiver and built-in slide-down keyboard.  The N800 has a FM radio and no hardware keyboard.  There are some differences on memory capacity as well, but these will almost certainly change as Nokia releases OS2008 performance updates.While I do not own the N810, but I have had the opportunity to play with one for an hour or two at the Nokia store in downtown Chicago.  The internet is where I make my living, so I try to experiment with any portable device that will allow me the freedom to work away from my desk.The N800 is sold with OS2007.  The N810 is delivered with OS2008.  The OS2008 performance upgrade is now available for the N800, allowing you to have most of the features of the $400+ N810 in the now sub-$300 N800 tablet.  If you do not need a GPS receiver (or already own a bluetooth GPS receiver), you can use the N800 to perform the exact same tasks as the more expensive N810.  Consider your needs and then decide what's works best for you.On the plus side, the N810 is slightly smaller than the N800.  The N810's keyboard is much easier to use than the on-screen touch keyboard I'm stuck with.  The N810 casing is all metal and feels a bit more durable than the N800.Whichever device you choose, the new operating system and browser are excellent and allow easy browsing of most websites.  The Mozilla browser with Flash9 renders most websites beautifully on the small screen.  The user interface is a lot more intuitive in OS2008 and it's very easy to email, chat and browse.  It won't completely replace my laptop - neither the N800 or N810 can print without extensive modification - but you truly can carry the web with you wherever you go!I hope you found this review helpful!"

3496,"I got this adapter to use with my aging Canon Digital Rebel XT. I was tired of dealing with clunky USB Compact Flash card readers and the USB port on the camera is extremely slow. This solves the issue because it lets me use an SD card, which nearly any laptop can read.The adapter functions great and the camera is able to store pictures on it, but it's definitely slower than the old 2GB Compact Flash card it replaced. The card busy LED on the camera stays on for about twice as long as it did with the CF card, and you can take about 6 less burst photos before the camera's buffer is filled."

3498,"I've been buying APCC back up systems for home use for many years.  An older ES350 with a battery barely over a year old died and instead of buying a new battery I spent a tiny bit more and bought a new, bigger UPS.  I've gotten this model before but this one looks different, and finally, after decades of having telephone RJ11/RJ14 plugs for surge suppression, it now takes ethernet cables.  Just where APCC needed to be - 20 years ago.  Except that according to the manual these are for 10-100 mbps ethernet.  Unfortunately, those are a long since obsolete ethernet standard.Another issue the batter cables are so short they are very hard to connect.  You connect them, start to put the battery in, and they pop back off.  Also, there is no clear way to tell what is going on with the UPS.  A coule LED's hopefully tell you whether the unit is working.  And the alarm can't be shut off without a computer to do it from.  The unit did not come with a cd for the monitoring software.  Hopefully that's not a problem since one should be able to download the software from the apcc site, where a new version shows up once every several years.  The software works but is badly inadequate in terms of telling you what has been going on with your line current in detail.BTW, this unit has a different purpose; to maintain power for a cable modem and a router.  Which means I've no way to see how the unit is holding up.  My feeling is at this price range a small LCD should be included with status info.  Keeping in mind that small LCD based calculators are available for under $1, this should not be an issue, except that APCC products - while they tend to work well, are decades behind in their abilities.  Not enough outlets, especially for bricks, and no APCC product optimized for this type of use - cable modems, routers, etc. that use low power and lots of powered outlets and a good display.Still, if you need backup power at home, this is a good choice."

3504,"I was using a tripod and head meant for photography with my video camera for a while. That worked fine unless I needed to zoom in and pan/tilt. The head just did not have any smooth motion to it, and the handle used to move the head had too much play in it, even when tightened as much as possible. I looked around to see what solutions there were, and within a price range that wouldn't kill me. Wandering around Company A for a solution I came across this one. The other reviewers seemed to think it was a good value, and at the time there was only 1 negative review. I took a chance and bought it.After it arrived and took it out of its box I was immediately concerned. There was a sticky substance on the teeth of the head which provide the friction and stability for tilting. It looked like it might be the fluid that the head uses to dampen movement. I tested out the unit by tilting it up and down, and nothing appeared to leak. I did my best to wipe off as much of the stuff as possible, and gave it another tilt, going the full range. It felt smooth, and again nothing leaked from it. I have no idea what the stuff was that was on it, but whatever it was didn't appear to make the product defective. I just have to question the manufacturing or packaging procedures they're using, allowing one of these to leave the factory in that condition. Seems like that should have been caught by someone inspecting these.Next up I had to figure out which of my existing tripods I was going to mount this on. After a few minutes of examining some of them and trying to remove the head from my sturdiest tripod, it became clear that the choice was: get a new tripod. None of the tripods I have are modular, meaning they're all one piece and not meant to swap the head out. I needed this to be ready the next day for shooting video at a wedding, so I hit up a local camera shop and bought a Manfrotto tripod, one of the nicer non-carbon fiber models. Very sturdy piece of gear, and I wanted to be sure that the head was going to be used on a stable platform. The last thing I needed was panning and tilting from a nice fluid head to be ruined by putting it on a wobbly tripod.After pairing the two together, I gave it a test shot. My wife provided the subject, and I had her walk around the room, sitting and standing in various locations as I panned and tilted, and zoomed in while panning and tilting. Even when zoomed in as tight as possible, as long as I maintained fairly even pressure I was able to get incredibly stable shots. The difference between the Manfrotto tripod/Davis & Sanford fluid head and the old camera tripod was amazing. Keep in mind my video camera is an HD Sony lightweight. Even so, the head allows for tightening the drag independently for panning and tilting. It took only a few seconds to dial in a good match for the video camera.The real test was at the wedding. It took place on a ferry, and even on a mobile platform such as a ferry ride, the video I captured was smooth as silk whenever I had to pan or tilt. I'm very happy with this product. Although I cannot give any advice when it comes to heavier video cameras, I can state emphatically that this unit works very well for lightweight video cameras.As for the one negative review this item has received, I can only assume that the person who bought it was mad that the head didn't match his tripod base, and he or she didn't adjust the panning appropriately. This is a modular head meant for modular tripods, and uses a standard 3/8"" screw base. So, if you don't have a modular tripod with a 3/8"" base, then this is not the head for you, unless you buy a tripod meant for these types of heads."
3505,"I haven't had any burning problems whatsoever with this product. I burn videos at 8X, which is kind of slow but works for me. If I burn at a faster rate, sometimes I end up with scattered skipping in the video and audio. The negative side of this product is the LightScribe image burning results are less than satisfactory. Perhaps, it is due to my older burner."
3506,"I started experimenting with voip (Internet phone service) when my phone bill started hitting $100/month without us making any long distance calls.  I switched to Vonage, which in my personal experience, was a nightmare.  Our voices echoed, calls phased out into a digital garbled mess before they dropped.  And they dropped constantly.  I tried cancelling Vonage, but once they had my money, they wouldn't return it, but would charge me extra to leave.I bring this up, because ooma is everything Vonage isn't.The sound is perfect--no digital noise, no echoes.  Vonage technical support told us our cordless phone was causing interference, so we had really long phone cords running all over the house as we tried to keep any wireless device from bothering the little Vonage box.  I tried disconnecting our Wii, turned off the wireless capabilities on my Mac. Now my phone is right next to the ooma box, I have my computer's wireless capabilities turned back one--no noise, no interference.  The sound is clear.  Hmmm.  What does that tell you?  With ooma, I didn't need technical support.  The setup instructions couldn't be easier.No service contract.  I own the box, and as long as I own the box, it works.  If I change my mind in 8 months, no one to call.  It just works. Ooma uses Peer-to-Peer networking, so even if the ooma headquarters drops down a sinkhole, the ooma box still works.I have to admit Vonage scared me a little, so I've got the ooma running AND I have a regular phone line.  What that means is that in order to have Caller ID and the required Call Forward On Busy, I have to send my old phone company about $20/month, and I had to call my phone company to get them to make the change.  Thus the four stars instead of five.  The advantage is that if whether the Internet is up or down or if the electricity goes out, we have phone service.Download those files.  With Vonage, I had to run around stopping every computer process, pausing every download when the phone rang so I could hear the caller.  The ooma box prioritizes Internet traffic for you, so you always have a clear line.So far I'm impressed.  I'd be 5-star impressed, I think, if I got rid of the land line."
3507,"This connector works well, but is easily lost. Some optical cables come with an end cover that is attached to the cable to prevent loss. That would be a nice addition for minimal cost increase."
3508,"As programs and computers get more complicated day by day you really need to have the maximum amount of memory on board your device. This was an upgrade for me, it was a snap to install and well worth it."
3509,"Bought this item as an upgrade to a Harmony 510. Also purchased a PS3 adapter to use with the Harmony One.  The unit was simple to program, is simple to operate and works as advertised. My wife simply put the model # of all our devices in and the activities that we needed and 5 minutes later we were controlling all of our AV devices with a minimum of one touch.  The codes available from Logitech have so far matched our equipment perfectly.  We have mainly Sony equipment but the Harmony One gives a good deal more control than the 510 did and we are pleased with the results so far.  The rechargable battery is nice as the unit tends to use a good deal of power.  We also have u-verse TV and there are few universal controllers that carry all of the codes standard for the Cisco tuner that AT&T uses.  The Harmony One works fine with the Cisco tuner.  In combination with the PS3 adapter the unit controls the blu-ray and other non-game functions of my PS3 as well as the sony ps3 controller did.  Now, instead of 3 controllers on my coffee table there is only one. I know that there are less expensive units on the market but if ease of set-up and ease of change are important this unit is hard to beat."
3510,"I use my computer as an entertainment center, and watch most of my TV and movies on it.  It's about 15 feet from my bed, so it's a big hassle to get up all the time to switch between programs, etc.  I do have a Snapstream Firefly remote, but it is limited in what it can do, especially with mouse capability.  It is not easy to do things such as switching between two programs, etc.  The Logitech DiNovo is small enough that it can be used similar to a remote control, and is much more compact than trying to use a wireless keyboard and mouse (even a mini keyboard and mouse).  It is a good remote keyboard device for your PC or PS3 (can't be used with a Mac or Xbox).The touch sensor on the mouse control is very well made. It's a lot like the iPod touch sensor, in that it's not too sensitive, and can be navigated quickly.  The mouse sensor also doubles as a 4-directional controller for left, right, up, down.  I could see how this would be useful for gaming, although I'm not too sure how effective it would be for serious gaming.  Most serious gamers will probably find the diNovo inadequate for this.  On the left side are two large channel up and channel down buttons, which are also very nice.  Along the top exist a row of media center buttons (much like a media center keyboard), for quick opening of those applications.Response time on the unit is excellent. Sitting about 20 feet from my computer, the signal came across very quickly with no problems.  It uses an RF signal so you don't have to point the unit at the TV.  I went back in my house as far as 40 feet and still was able to get a signal.As for the keyboard, it is fairly small, but not so small as to be uncomfortable. I was able to use it fairly easily, although it is somewhat awkward unless you have a coffee table to put it on.  Trying to type on it while holding it with both hands yields much the same results as texting on a cell phone.  I believe it is designed for ""thumb-typing"" as opposed to actual traditional typing.  But there is plenty of room to hit the keys and I didn't have a problem with mistyping keys because they were too small.  You can't really use it for extended typing or composing emails, etc, but if you want to use the keyboard for short chatting in games it's great.  The device looks great too.  It is very stylish, especially with the mirrored finish on the cover.  The size of the device is a little larger than a man's hand and fits well next to your other remotes.Lastly, the battery life is exceptional.  I've been using it for almost two weeks now and haven't had to recharge it yet.  Although the price of the keyboard is somewhat high, I think it is worth it depending on your needs and how much you need a keyboard, and would definitely recommend it."
3511,"This adjustable umbrella/flash bracket will meet most requirements of most photographers, regardless of their level. The body is made of high impact molded plastic. The upper and lower clamp adjustment screws holes are reinforced by the use of ""pen-nuts."" They are pressed into the holes as they enter the plastic body. This is good and should hold up to most torque requirements. Too bad they didn't do this for the screw that tightens & holds the umbrella into place. That screw hole is just a taped hole into plastic body [shame]. Also, the screw is a 6-32 screw and will NOT stand much torque. I would have rated this product 5 star if it was for this. This is a case of ""penny wise, pound foolish"" of the manufacture. So, be careful with the umbrella screw. You will strip it out if you aren't carefully.This is a good product and does what it's supposed to, with care. It could have been a great product if the manufacture had taken a little more pride in their product.I can use it on top of a light stand or a standard tripod. I can connect my flash with the screw for my TTL cable or via the hotshoe. Umbrella fits nicely. I would recommend its purchase but tighten with care!"
3512,"This camera is very nice for the price, but for a 5x zoom it wasn't much better than my old 3x zoom."
3513,"Got this lens to go with my new EOS T4i, and have only very rarely used the 18-55 that it came with. It takes very good photos, makes for nice &#34;Depth&#34; perception effects, as I use it primarily on the lowest F-Stop I can put it on. I would have preferred a wider aperture, but for the price... (I got it on sale) I can't complain, as it does what I want very nicely. It is a little too &#34;telephoto&#34; for quick shots indoors of people, as the field of view [naturally] is pretty small. But that is what a telephoto zoom lens is for.One technical gripe I have is that the zoom ring is ever so slightly loose, giving a little play when I go to turn to adjust the zoom. Not really a big deal, but it is something I have noticed.Overall: Very pleased."
3514,"I got to of these last Cyber Monday for less than 20 bucks each... and at $20 it definitely is worthy of 4 stars. It sounds good... far from clean and precise but great for listening at the gym. Highs are okay... tons of bass. I got it in both black and gun metal... the latter one looks really cool. It looks and feels very sturdy but I guess it's too early to tell. Case is useful & protective, but look extremely tacky."
3515,"The first one I got failed after I formatted, partitioned and put some back up files from the hard drive (HD) it suppose to replaced. I have attached this HD in a dock connected via usb. Afterwards, it won't show up among the devices under My Computer. I requested Company A for the same kind replacement and I am very satisfied with the ease of exchange. So far it's now on my laptop working like magic. All I hear is a quiet blower/fan like sound. I am not sure if this is coming from the hard drive or the laptop fan. My laptop came (original) with a dual 120 GB HD. This is my second 500 GB Scorpio Blue hard drive upgrade, the other is more than a year old now, so far so good. I keep all my OS on the master (new) hard drive (Win7-64; Win7-32; Vista-32) and something else. The second hard drive is partitioned to contains all my files, photo, music, etc. I keep all else on my external 1 TB HD. It's less painful if it fails. I highly recommend this HD."
3516,works very well and i have had it for about 6 months no problems what so ever it has lots of space.
3517,"As I mentioned in the title I've had this watch for a while now.  Bought it when deployed to Iraq in 2008 and it's worked great ever since.  I can see why it could be frustrating to some people because it can be rather easy to hit the dial but as some mentioned you can adjust the sensitivity.  Once you get the hang of it there should be no issues.Likes:  Accurate as I've used it for many 2 mile PT tests in the Army and it's always been spot on.  Multiple options for the display and easy to switch between modes by simply tapping.  Syncs to computer and can track my workouts.Dislikes:  When wet it can be a little more tricky to operate but simply drying it off solves this issue.Overall very pleased with it.  It takes some time to get used to due to the touch interface but once you've become accustomed to it, very easy to use."
3518,"I read the reviews and took a shot with this replacement battery as my old one would only hold a charge for about 30 minutes, TOPS. I received this in about 2 days without a prime account, so they were very quick to send this. Looks brand new out of the mail packaging. Plugged it right in and charged the battery overnight. It does have a sticker that says &#34;Charge for 10 hours before using battery&#34; (something like that). Like all rechargeable batteries, I ran the battery pretty much all the way out (5% left) and then charged again for about 2 hours after completely charged. Unplugged and drained. Did this about 3 times and while I was on battery, I ran a lot of programs to speed it up. Well, about a month later this battery keeps my laptop charged for roughly 2 hours of wi-fi web browsing (nothing too heavy, a couple tabs open and maybe music running). When I'm flying, if I turn the wifi button on my laptop off, I get a little over 3 hours depending on what I'm doing. Video, 3-1/2 tops. Work (excel's, pdf's, html, word) 3 tops if I have a few programs running.All in all, I'd say this was a good buy. It's working as expected. I'm sure within a year or so the battery wont hold as much, but honestly, what can you expect? Great replacement for a budget minded person."
3519,"My delivery from Company A was fast at the best price anywhere, but the battery and memory card packages were flopping around in the box because it was inadequately packed and the corner was crushed -- luckily the camera seems to be ok.Let me jump ahead of myself to alert you: ***if the screen goes black when you turn the camera vertically, put your hand up to your ear and remove your polarized sunglasses!!!***The (reddish) brown is butt-ugly but reduces glare from around the viewfinder. The plastic doors are unimpressive, I hope they hold up. The buttons are simply arranged and well thought-out among monitor displays, menus, and functions. I wish the lens started out with a wider angle. The body size is nice and small, smaller than I expected from the product photo. Startup, shutter reponse, and recovery are still too slow. Movies are easy to shoot.Special-feature-wise you can easily set up color accent, color swap, sepia, dark or light skin tones and get obvious results. Other custom color settings changes are barely noticable. Stitching pictures that overlap in any way can be done in their verrrrry slooooow software. I often need to take two shots with different readings because the meter can't manage sky detail and shade detail in a single shot."
3520,"Just got this camera on Christmas morning.  The wife is happy since it is a small and direct camera.  Company A.com did an excellent job getting the camera and memory sticks to the house on Christmas Eve.  Kudos to the Campbellsville FC, which I am sure a friend of mine packed out for me, lol.  A few things to be aware of before buying this camera:-- Read the reviews that list out the specs on this cameras, features, etc.  They are nice to review and give you an idea what is going on.-- BUT, I have not found one that mentions the special NB-4L battery this camera uses instead of regular ones.  This is not a huge deal, but like any special battery comes issues with What If the Battery Dies?  You will be jammed up, since it is unique, and does not charge quickly like the Rayvoc 15 minutes ones.-- BUY at least a few more battery back ups!-- Remember, this is a point and shoot, not a professional grade camera, so do not expect the world from it.  For the price and size, it does solid work, and will prove a great camera for years to come.-- Consumer Reports named this camera their Top Pick for Compacts!  But they failed to mention the battery as well.  This was one of the rare rankings from CR that they did not recommend every item in a category, so this could mean a great product.Good luck, and like any product, if it has an error, get with the companies as fast as possible for a replacement or refund.  I have always bought Fuji products for the larger cameras, but they do not make very good smaller cameras.  According to all the magazines, Canon is the standard right now, so we will see."
3521,"Picked this up after building a media center PC to run XBMC on.  It works right out of the box, with no issues at all.The battery cover came off after an accidental drop off the couch and broke the little clip that holds it in.  So its not held on by some tape.  For the price, you cant expect top of the line quality.  But like I said, it works."
3522,"The Sandisk Sansa Clip accomplishes all that I wanted in an MP3 player which I intended to use at work, to use while riding on the subway and to use while working out at the gym.Pros:- Small, compact, light-weight, and better looking than pictured (as is the case with the 1MB, 2MB and 4MB versions). The 4MB has a very cool, beautiful mirrored finish. But I would recommend you buy a silicone case or something to protect this finish and the player itself.- Crisp, bright display but as mention in other reviews, because of the mirrored finish it can be a bit hard to see in the sunlight- The clip in the back, hence the name, which makes it easy to attach the player onto your pockets, an armband, or anywhere you want to clip this unit.- Awesome sound coming out of this little player. The better the headphones you attach the better the sound. But even with the included headphones, very nice sound.- Better value than the 4MB iPod nano that I was considering purchasing. Way more features and most importantly, it has a radio. Not sure why after all these years Apple never seemed fit to put FM tuners on their players.- I like that there's a mute button for the radio as opposed to having to turn the volume all the way down.- There's radio broadcast recording.- A voice recorder- The unit has an on-the-go playlist. You can compile all your favorite songs at an instant.- You can drop and drag songs and create playlists right onto the player itself. You don't have to use another program such as iTunes or Winamp. You will find out once you get the Sandisk Sansa Clip that Sandisk recommends that you use the Rhapsody player program, which you can download and use for free and works best for editing the songs and playlists on the unit.Just another note about creating playlists on the Sansa Clip. I found through trial and error that it's best to first create playlists on the unit itself, meaning when the player shows up in My Computer on your desktop, double click on it and add songs to your Music folder, then select and right click on the particular songs you want to make a playlist. Click the option to ""Create Playlist"". By default, you will see, ""New Playlist"" in your Music folder. When you double click on it, you will see all your songs you made into a playlist. You can rename ""New Playlist"" to whatever you want ex. Playlist 1. You then cut and paste your newly created playlist to the Playlist folder. This method is preferable rather than doing it through programs such as Rhapsody, Windows Media Player, or Winamp. In my experience, when doing it with these programs the playlists either didn't display correctly or didn't show up at all. Once your playlists have been created successfully on the unit then you can go into Rhapsody(recommended) or any other MP3 player program and edit or add songs to your playlists.Cons:- For some reason certain songs are unable to show up on the list of songs on the playlists I create even though they are on the unit. In other words, say you put, ""Elvis - Heartbreak Hotel"" onto the player and that's in ""Playlist 1"", the song will be there and you will be able to play it, however when you look through the list of songs in ""Playlist 1"", all you see is a blank space where the artist and title should be. Even when I edit the tags and type in the artists and titles of the songs, it still doesn't display. This can be a problem when you are looking for a particular song via the list. Strangely though, when you are playing the songs within the playlist and you manually scan through the songs, the artist and title that was not being displayed before shows up. I haven't figured out why this happens. Very weird.- As far as design and function, I think it would be easier if the Power/Reset button slid down as opposed to up.- As said by other reviewers, I don't like that the volume toggle switch is under the headphone port. The headphone plug gets in the way. If the headphone port was at the top of the unit, this wouldn't be a problem. Because of the location of the headphone port, having headphones plugged in and sticking out increases the width of the player.Overall, even with the minor gripes I have, the Sandisk Sansa Clip is a solid MP3 player and a great value for the price."
3523,"Overall an excellent camera. I would rate it best quality for it's price. In six months, I took 1375 pictures and videos in Iraq. Obviously, Iraq is a sandy place in the desert, and sandstorms are inevitable. Needless to say, sand eventually got into the retractable lens and caused it to mulfunction, then stop working. RIP Exilium."
3524,"Update (2/3/09): After more fiddling with my lens hood, I found out it can be reverse mounted! Now I am giving it 5 stars.I just received this lens hood today. Fit and finish is very good. No drama. For about $15, it is worth every penny I spent. However, there is one thing it cannot do that a genuine Canon lens hood can, that is it cannot reverse mount on the lens to save space in my camera bag. Not a big deal, but I wish it can do it. The 1 star it lost was for that reason.The inside of the hood has no flocking, but so do any other 3rd party lens hood. The inside has a non-reflective surface though."
3525,I use this for connecting external speakers to my PC in the office.  This connects them quite a distance from the PC and I am happy with it.
3526,Voice recognition with my N&uuml;vi 885T is amazingly accurate. It is easy to use and I like the adjustable strap.
3527,As advertised. No need to replace whole assembly. Not that hard to just replace lamp.
3528,"I started out with a K100D and when the K10D came out, I was immediately green with envy. A few years later, the K200D came out, it was competitively priced and had most of the great K10D features. I cut my losses and traded the K100D in for the K200D. I am very pleased with it. The reasons for the trade were for the following features:+ Remote flash: I've always wanted this feature that Nikon users take for granted, it doesn't work as great and sometimes doesn't detect the controlling flash. But when within range and everything, it works and am very happy to finally have it.+ Weather seals: sure, it's not bullet proof and doesn't help the lenses at all. But I used to not take my camera out when weather conditions were not fair. The same goes for my friends with canons and nikons. With the K200D, I have no fears of taking it out and actually USING it. I know, it's totally a psychological thing, but the peace of mind is still a feature to me.+ Sensor cleaner: The anti shake feature is also used to shake off the dust in the K200D, it doesn't really work, I never notice it shaking anything off. But I also set it to shake upon power up. I also have a Giottos rocket blower, the combination seems to keep the K200D relatively dust free. Much more so than my K100D. I know it's not just the weather seals because I know the dust is getting in when I change lenses.+ Better WB & PRIME engine: the color control is much better in the K200D, an immense improvement and main reason for the upgrade.+ Shoots in DNG format: I am no longer tied to Pentax's photolab SW. I can now use photoshop without any plugins or upgrades. Very good feature.The things I miss on the K100D:- Battery power seems more finicky on the K200D, I had to switch to Eneloops, which allows me to get 1000+ images per charge. AMAZING, but sad that it only performs with Eneloops.- The images look under exposed and overly contrasted. These features can be offset easily, but it does take some time to get used to and learn to work around. Once you learn its behavior, it is very predictable and linear.- My external flash no longer gets perfect exposure every time in any condition. For some reason, the K200D works terribly with the FGZ540. It is very easy to under or over expose an image. I am not sure if this is because I shoot in ISO100 vs K100D's ISO200. But the end result is I can no longer turn on the FGZ and just shoot. I have to manually set the flash zoom. The flash exposure setting doesn't seem to do anything either. I've gone on forums to see if I have a defective K200D, but in the end, I've moved on and have accepted the issue.I am very very happy with the K200D, as the DSLR market gets more and more competitive, I still find the K200D completely usable for all my needs. If you want a DSLR that just works out of the box, you should stick with canons and nikons. Pentax is really for the dedicated and people with a pentax lens collection. Feature for feature, pentax always loses to canons and nikons, but it is still more than enough for anyone who is serious about photography. Especially if you've done film photography, I feel that Pentax replicates the film camera experience better than all other brands. Its simplicity and attention to detail gives it that classic feeling. While other brands focus on speed, specs and little functions that make it completely and totally feel... digital. I do envy those features some times. When I see my friends shoot in 800 or 1600ISO with no noise at all, I am jealous. But then, you really can't do that with film either. So I've come to terms with Pentax's short comings. I hope Pentax will turn things around with their full frame DSLRs."
3529,"I have a Simpletech 250 GB portable hard drive. Now I need another because it is full. It is very reliable, quiet and small. The only con I have is not long after I got mine the label on the back came off. Its printed right on the drive that if the label is ""removed or tampered with"" the warranty will be void. I've never had to test that theory, but it kind of scared me that the label came off so easily. I think the heat (it doesn't get super hot, but does get warm) loosened the adheisive and it just eventually fell off. I kept the label but I think it would suck if I had to have it repaired and they wouldn't do it because the label came off, no fault of my own.Overall it's a great drive though. And the price here is unbeatable.  I'm going to get one of these, and office max has a 1tb desktop drive on sale right now that I'm getting for backup if I don't find something less expensive here."
3530,"bought this to mount up a new 60 inch TV.Pros:works great, sturdy just make sure you screw it into your studs (if you don't know what that is don't mount it yourself), cant beat the price ($25), the HDMI cable that came with it is probably worth the $25, the level was a cheep one time use just in case you didn't have one.Cons:kind of a puzzler to put together, to secure the bottom screws when the TV is mounted you need a long (about a foot to a foot and a half) screw driver or multiple bit attachments to get to it."
3531,Why spend $$$$ at Best buy when the Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flush Tilt Dual Hook works just as good for a fraction of the price
3532,Got this one about 9 months ago with special focus on my upcoming Alaska trip then. Just what the doctor ordered for the trip. Good quality and everything and worked well with my Nikon D40 box. The only thing is the usual issue/spec. with a Non-VR lens. Needs good lighting when on high zoom and will need reasonably steady hands. But again this is a matter of how much you are ready to invest and want to go for the VR one with the additional cost. The Non-VR has worked OK for me and I haven't had any major concerns on my use with it so far. Go get it!
3533,"Great camera for the price. Has a lot of features. I mostly shoot in manual and aperture priority. Do keep in mind that this is a cropped sensor camera - I didn't know about cropped sensors before buying this camera. So those of you like me that are switching over from a film SLR will notice that the view finder is a lot smaller then what you're use to. But a full frame will set you back a lot more, so this is a good one to start with.The only thing I was concerned about was megapixels, thinking more is better. But if you're only going to be printing as large as 5x7 than, this really shouldn't be that much of a concern. I've read that the D series (30D, 40D, etc.) produces images with much less noise, so these might be cameras you may want to consider as well.I upgraded to the Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, and it is SUPER sharp. Highly recommended combo, but 28mm is a bit too tight for some indoor shots, so I got a 12-24 as well."
3534,"I tested the F100fd I received through Company A for the pink banding problem described by the previous reviewer, and it does not appear to have that problem.Also, I compared shots with this camera in moderate daylight to my Canon SD950 (both are 12MP and similar in size). I shot the same scenes at ISO100 (ISO80 on the Canon) and at ISO400. In terms of noise levels, the results were practically identical. The automated exposures and color turned out to be quite similar as well. At ISO400 on these cameras, fine details and textures are largely blurred out relative to the lowest settings, which produce a very fine-grained noise. I would tend to avoid using ISO settings beyond 400 on these cameras.Before receiving this camera I was concerned that the very useful 5x lens zoom range (28mm-140mm) might be compromised by distortion and softness, but the results are impressive for a camera of these dimensions. Over the middle range, the sharpness was slightly better than that of the SD950 (zoom range 36mm-133mm), especially near the frame edges.Recently, Canon released a 5x zoom model (SD890IS) with the relatively less useful range of (35mm-180mm). It has a 10MP sensor of smaller dimensions (1/2.5"" vs 1/1.6"").On the basis of my (so far, very limited) experience with this camera, I would rate it one of the best in its category. The minus one star is for the lack of manual shutter/aperture controls (available on the F50, F30 and other earlier Finepix models) and for apparently not controlling noise any better than Canon at ISO levels up to 400."
3535,"This case is very modest. I am not sure what i was expecting for $30 but i feel a little bit let down. The case although nice, doesn't seem to be worth as much money as you pay. However, if you are in need of a sleek, modest, simple case to hold your itouch then this seems appropriate. The outside is a deep earthy brown with a slightly raised texture that feels smooth."
3536,"Not quite as smooth a pan or tilt as I'd like--although it's gotten better with some manipulation and reassembly on my part.  And I don't care for the placement of some of the adjustment knobs and levers.  But overall, it's very sturdy. Looks great.  Heavy, but in a good way (just plan accordingly if you're going to be lugging it over a long distance). Recommended!"
3537,"I must admit I JUST got this and have only had it one day.  But, rest assured I literally have gone to at least 7-8 stores, pulled out of their boxes at least 15-18 diff. radios and played, prodded and looked and finally selected this one when coming across it.  (I actually bought it at Target for $59.99, same as above, but no shipping of course.) I'm very happy with it as of right now.  Time setting was so easy - 10 seconds, incl. changing it to my PST zone and it was done.  One primary necessity, among some others, was having a HEADPHONE JACK!!  The majority of clock radios do NOT have this anymore!  I like to listen to the radio sometimes at night with headphones and use the slumber switch - this way I don't disturb my DH.  Another was having GOOD, STEREO sound on the FM band.  A real nicety is that in addition to having a traditional snooze alarm bar, you can just ""wave your hand"" in front of the radio face instead of having to find/reach the snooze bar and it will reactivate repeatedly, if you like, in 9 min. increments (body heat from hand activates the snooze bar).  Also, the time can be projected onto your wall or ceiling, visible only during the dark, however, without being intrusive.  For those that are sensitive to the brightness of the face display, it has two levels of brightness or off - I don't find the std. setting too bright for me, however.  Numerals are large and easily seen with my nearsighted eyes - numerals are in red.  Alarms can be auto-set to activate only during the week or only on weekends or singly, of course.  Has dual alarms with multiple choices of how you'd like to be awakened and an IPOD dock - not important to me at the moment as I don't have one but I did want the other choices so that's fine; I'll buy one later.  Footprint isn't too big, could be worse.  Looks nice and contemporary.  I'm just real pleased with the decent sound; nice bass relatively speaking and 100% better than almost all the other ones I plugged in and listened to.  I'm very fussy so keep that in mind if you don't like doing all the leg work."
3538,"As far as the micro SD card goes, it works just fine.Drawbacks:Since this only comes with the SD adapter, you'll need to make sure that either your card reader for your PC is SDHC compatible, or you'll need to also purchase a SDHC or micro SDHC USB card reader.  If you don't have any SDHC compatible readers, you won't be able to transfer data to/from your computer to this card.Secondly, while this card comes with the full-size adapter, it does not come with a case.  If you'll always have the card in your camera, phone, etc, this might not be a big issue for you, but I still think a case would be nice to at least store the adapter.Third, in my card reader, the adapter was very hard to pull out.  This was partly an issue with my card reader, as it doesn't allow very much of the full-size SD card to stick out, but the adapter also seemed very tight in the reader compared to regular SD cards.As for the speed, I haven't done any specific testing, but nothing made me feel the card was slow.  I'm using it in an M3 DS real for a Nintendo DS, and haven't had any compatibility issues.Overall, it works well with a couple minor drawbacks.  For the price it was the best deal at the time, though I would've paid a bit more if it came with a case and an SDHC reader."
3539,Pros: Installed easily. Seems to work well. Vista 64 bit compatible.Cons: USB cable is attached and short. Better if longer. No fax software.
3540,"Power supply is running fine, but the 6-pin PCI-E video cable is too short.  Tried it on two full sized mobos, and while it will stretch enough to fit, it seems to put a lot of torc on the video card.  An extra inch or two would have been much better."
3541,"The Apple's iPad 2 is a huge hit at our house. My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got aRover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Visionto remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.You can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.I imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size Company K whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly Company K choices. You will still require a Company K to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.Addendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.CA Luster"
3542,"The product arrived on time and is as described. The batter capacity is sufficient to charge my iPhone 4S several times. It will more than half way charge my iPad 2. I bought it as a charger, and not for the laser and LED light, but they are nice to have. However, i was hoping for a better performing laser and LED light. Both are fairly dim."
3543,The included protective cover fits well and the armband holds it well while running or jogging.
3544,"Alright, so obviously you know what it does and you're probably wondering if it is powerful enough. I also wanted to know this before buying the product.Here is what most people do before buying this product:Many people out there may try to blow air through their mouth. This is a bad idea since you will obviously get small specks of saliva on the lens which will make it harder to clean.Some people decide that they will only use a lens pen or microfiber cleaning cloth. From what I understand (and this is purely unscientific) excessive cleaning will actually degrade the quality of the front element over time (or even the rear element). Don't get me wrong. I use a microfiber cleaning cloth as well. However, I use it as a last resort if the air blower doesn't remove the visible particles.This leads me to this product. Is it powerful enough? I mean it is intended for optical and computer equipment (keyboards). Yes and no. Some people will like the quick rush of air. I personally do not think it is nearly as powerful as it should be. It has served me well so far but on occasion it proves to be rather unpowerful. You may find some dust particles stick to the lens even after use. That is when I pull out the microfiber cloth.Recommendation:Yes, I'd buy it bearing in mind that I may have to whip out my trusty microfiber cleaning cloth. This is a moderately powerful blower that I'll probably be keeping. I hope Giottos comes out with something more potent in the future since I don't like cleaning down the lens by hand (for reasons mentioned above)."
3545,"This device, is small, lightweight, easy to use (as long as you read the instructions first) and very portable.  You can choose whether you want 60 hours of record time (LP), or 300 (EP).  There are a few tricks, such as placing the device on HOLD after use so as to not run down the batteries (again, read the instructions!).  You can set it to voice-activate, and you can turn the device's own sounds on or off (beeps on or beeps off). Once you set up the recorder (date, time, etc), your basic functions follow; just press RECORD, and when you're done, STOP!  No tapes, no heaviness, just ease. It is a pleasure to use.  I use it as my dream journal, and if I can wake in the middle of the night and effectively record my dreams with ease, anyone wide awake will certainly have no problems!I do not use this with a computer, so all of this talk of incompatibility is lost on me. For basic use, it is an excellent choice."
3546,"Good headphones, sound more than acceptable but with a little lack of fidelity, are comfortable despite their size big but considering its low price,deserve 4 stars"
3547,"This is a solid monitor for the money, excellent picture with no dead pixels. My only complaint would be that the LED which blinks to indicate that the monitor has gone into energy saving mode is VERY bright.Due to poor packaging, the monitor arrived with a small crack on the front of the case. Deal-Stop.com offered to replace it at no cost but since it didn't affect the operation of the monitor I chose to keep it. Overall I'm quite satisfied with the purchase."
3548,"this camera isn't very good for long distance night vision...but it is good enough for daylight, it also has sound, and I am not sure if you can disable it...so if you want to keep it in the same room as the tv, you would have to keep it down...but the range it pretty good, I was trying it through out the house...three walls if as much as I could get it to work well...at about 30 feet...but through one, it gets kinda fuzzy....but what can I say, that's wireless for you....if you don't have the money/time/or just don't want to run wires, this camera is pretty good choice...just need some kind of cord so you can have some range for the plug..."
3549,"This is a very cheap piece of plastic gear, and the first one I got was dead and had to be exchanged. BUT, the working replacement is still cheap feeling, but works quite well. If you have the money, the two Canon original equipment macro ring flashes are excellent units, with few detractors. But for occasional use, they're really hard to justify price-wise. This no-name (Phoenix is a camera generic brand) unit works fine, allowing me to get well illuminated macro shots that really do require a ring flash.Pros: Recycle time is fast, illumination is even, and it plays well with Canon.Cons: Cheapest imaginable construction, and first one was dead in the box."
3550,"This is one of the best iPod compact (relatively) speaker systems I have used -- and I have been through a fair number of them over the last few years. The stereo quality is very, very good for the money & size (it's not audiophile quality, but then life isn't perfect, either.)The sound and clarity are excellent, and I am delighted to be able to combine an iPod dock with a very good FM radio that offers sound that is  several notches above the noise emitted by those clock-radio/iPod docks.I have two quibbles: the remote control design (which several other people have cited -- let's face it, which of us is more likely to adjust the bass settings than the volume??) and the function that theoretically allows me to preset radio stations, which doesn't want to work.Still, I give this four stars simply because for the price, I have yet to find a better system. You can pay far more and end up with far less (or a system that crashes with a month or two), as I have discovered. Its sleek design fits beautifully in my home office.I should note that I have not tried to use it as part of a home entertainment system, with a television set, so can't comment on that feature."
3551,"My UPDATED impression of this TV - amazing picture with some annoying features.Originally, I did not think there was a great difference in image quality from my SONY Trinitron (which will never die) to justify the price tag. Included in all the hate mail I received over my review, were some helpful messages (thank you C. Wyatt). One noting that I should call Samsung since it should work much better then I reviewed. I called the 800 number included in the packet and received wonderful and helpful customer support - this is a BIG PLUS in my book. They went through a few steps with me over the phone before giving me a local service to call and arrange for service. This company was also nice and arranged for someone to come to my house within a few days. Sweet. The guy came as scheduled and went to work. When he opened the back, there were a whole bunch of circuit boards he looked at before determining the ""brain board"" (his words, not mine) needed to be replaced. All my previous setting were lost but the improved picture was well worth it. YEAH! I finally see what everyone else is raving about. The clarity is amazing.I still have the same minor complaints: (1) the instruction manual is NOT for the remote included with the set - ARRGHH!; (2) set takes a good five seconds to access a channel and although this sounds minor, the time drags when you want to catch a moment in football or basketball and have to sit there waiting; (3) remote is very bulky (measures 10"" long) and not comfortable to hold; (4) there is a light blue light on the just below the middle of the screen (on the tv stand) that lights up whenever the TV is on which can be distracting when watching a movie with the lights off; and (5) whenever we use an item connected by HDMI cables (like taking a dvd out) it automatically turns the TV on and gets it ready.Bottom line: this set gives an amazing picture for the price and call Samsung if you have any problems with your set. As long as it is under warranty (1 year from purchase), they will be happy to help you. Just know that there are minor irritants that come along with the great quality."
3552,"I recently got a new mp3 player, and though I like that one better, I still think the Opal is good for the price. It has good sound quality, and 4GB was enough to hold most of my music. I also love the radio, especially the fact that you can record music off of it (something my new player can't do). I've also found it to be pretty durable. Not long after I got it, I dropped it in a sink of water, but it didn't seem to damage it. There was one time when it kept freezing up, but, though it erased my music files, I was able to fix it myself with a download from the RCA website.This player does have a few problems. Most notably, the interface is so clunky. If you choose to listen to a certain CD under an artist's menu, you can't go back and just pick another CD from the same artist. You have to start over from the main menu. It also jumps back to the main menu whenever the screen goes dark. You can't make playlists. Also, when transitioning from one song to the next, it often starts in the middle of the new song. All you have to do is hit the back button, but it's still an annoyance.All in all, though, the Opal does what it's supposed to- play mp3. It doesn't have lots of fancy features, but it has good sound qualities. There are some annoyances, especially with the interface, but I was willing to deal with them for the price."
3553,"I mounted this one above my front door in the entry, and tied it into the security DVR.The picture is excellent, and even on a moonless night with the porch lights off, the picture is as bright and clear as a sunny day.It's nice to see who is at the door and to watch for those sneeky UPS and FEDEX deliveries that drop and run leaving a package on the front door step in plain view of the street.  (ARRRRRGGGGG!)I also teamed this up with the optional microphone, they make a great pair for enhancing the security of my home."
3554,"I got this matching red foam float strap for my red Olympus Stylus TG-830 and red case Tamrac 3814.  I was paying more to see Olympus print on the outside strap like the photo but when I got it, it is blank only said made in China inside.  I was little disappointed.  I could have pay few dollars less for other brand."
3555,One of the best suction mount that I have used. Will stick to almost any flat surfaces like a leech! Didn't worry about it falling off at all.
3556,I use another brand myself but I got this one as a replacement for my son.  Don't know how it works but she seems to like it.
3557,"I started SWL when I was about 11yrs old. I used a home made kit. Then a year later my folks gave me a Satellite 1000 in 1964 back when Grundig was a top producer of radio equipment. The new 750 is no match for the 1000. I regret selling it. I guess Grundig has soldout to Eton which now produces the 750.It had no problem pulling in the FM stations I had problems with more common type store bought FM/AM radios. All my regular radios required a lot of adjusting the antenna to receive a station 35 miles away I always listen to classical music. So it's sensitivity is pretty good. There are a few FM station that broadcast very close to each other on the spectrum. The Grundig 750 had no problems of locking on to each station without dropout and locking on to another close station. So, I'd guess it's selectivity is descent  as well.I'm a HAM Radio Operator and couldn't resist hooking up a short 25 foot Beverage Antenna which I coupled to a balun purchased from DX Engineering. The balun was design for a much larger configuration but using the straight wire antenna ports didn't pull in those weaker station running at 100 watts or less.Running the antenna around where the ceiling and walls meet, put the wire up about 8 to 9 feet with the ground side connected to a power receptacle plate screw and the three feet of BNC cable(F-connector screw on and a BNC connector on the ends) that connects to the radios BNC antenna receptacle. Once all this rig was powered up, I started pulling in the Amateur stations on 20meters and 40meters, both sidebands and CW(morse code) allocated frequencies. The tunable BFO help fine tune the reception.I don't think you can fined much today that isn't made of plastics. The 750 has an all plastic case, except for the large handles on each side which has some function other than to give it an allusion of being a rack mount radio.All and all I liked this radio and would recommend it to anyone considering its purchase. I gave only four stars because it just doesn't come up to the old Grundig standard."
3558,"If you are like me and want a bit more reach than the standard 3x kit zooms (17-50, 18-55, etc) but don't like the price, weight, or optical compromises of a superzoom (18-250) then this is a great lens.  The build is really excellent for a lens of this price. It has nice weight and feels solid and well put together and it comes with a hood.  Autofocus is great.  It is noticeably better than the Canon non-USM lenses, but not quite as smooth and quiet as a ring USM/HSM lens like the 85mm f1.8.  It should be more than adequate for most people. Optics are a bit of a mixed bag, IMO.  From 18-85, it is excellent - easily beating the 18-55 IS and 17-85 IS and as good as any lens in its price range.  Past about 85mm or so, it starts getting a lot softer. I don't mean to say 125mm is unusable, but if you go out and shoot all day at both ends of the zoom, the wide shots stand out as incredibly sharp, while the ones at the long end are just OK.So quick pros/cons list:Pros:Great buildgreat priceperfect zoom rangeFast AFReally sharp and contrasty from 18-85mmCons:Focus ring rotates during AFJust OK optically from 90+"
3559,"I use it to listen to TV while not disturbing others in the house.  I had an extra power adapter, so the fact that it didn't come with one didn't matter.  Nice compact size of transmitter, good range, decent fidelity, and having two input channels is a pleasant plus.The only negative is that it may take time to find a comfortable fit over the ears, but after it's found, all is well."
3560,"Watching Band of Brothers on this is a blast!I only have a friends' MTX 12"" Home Theater sub. This thing puts out really nice bass to fill out the output of my RM8s that I use for fronts and surrounds. My room is only 12' x 12' (approx.) so I probably can't unleash all this sub's power. Still, it has the capability to push out SUPER low notes that can rattle your fillings (even at low volumes).Aesthetically, it's fairly plain but has a nice cover for the woofer and is pretty nondescript in my room's corner.At the price this sub has been going for, it's a total steal. I was thinking about the PSW505 as a competitor to this, but I think I made the right choice in choosing the BIC."
3561,"Well, first of all it's not like a cheap decal or anything. I've had it for long and it's not fading or anything.In fact I bought two.I took one star cuz one of those controllers had minor issues. Tho after asking Sony to take car of the warranty, everything seems fine.Just to let y'all know. Sony didn't wanted to replace me the control. They claimed the warranty was only 3 months or something like that.BUT! the warranty that comes with the control is actually of 1 (One) full year. And the paper says so. So they had no choice but to change it."
3562,I received this Microsoft Lifecam web cam with expectations of it being better in everyway than my old one from several years ago. Wow what a leap from one just a couple of years ago.PROS: The cost of the camera is less than what I paid for one a couple ofyears ago but is much clearer.The fact that the camera can be mounted almost anywhere is awsome. Ihang mine from the top of my laptop screen.The video quality is very good but frame rate could use some speed-ing up for fast movement.I like that you can pan and tilt but won't really use that too much.NEG:  The microphone is abit muffled at times. May be just me though.As mentioned earlier the frame rate could be a little faster forquick movements.I would recommend this camera to anyone that does not expect high def results. For the price it is really a great web cam!
3563,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of these. They're not great, but very usable, and more than acceptable for the price. There nice bass, voices are quite clear, and music is enjoyable, with no buzzing or tinniness. The sound quality actually isn't very inferior to the Logitech Z523, which cost more than double.One drawback is that the volume control doesn't apply to the headphones - the headphone signal isn't amplified, just passed through, so if you need some more power to the headphones, or an independent volume control for them - look elsewhere (like the Z523).If you just want an inexpensive speaker set - go for it."
3564,"It has just the right amount of outlets to be used as a personal travel protector, say Laptop, Camera, Phone, Tablet. It's good and works however it doesn't support Universal voltage, I use it on Europe and nothing happened but not recommended as Belkin doesn't says anything about universal voltage (That's why 1 star less).It charges really fast through the 2.1amp USB however if you want to charge at 2.1amp just 1 usb port can be used at a time, if you plug two devices they will charge as 1amp each as it is shared.Don't loose the little plug cover protector!! And watch to buy the 2.1amp version with the new Belkin logo."
3565,"Just peel the adhesive off and it sticks permanently to the wall or baseboard. It would be nice If it were a little wider. 2 Hdmi cables and a power cord are a real tight fit. It's perfect for hiding speaker wire and maybe a subwoofer cable, however. Overall a good product"
3566,"This item is quite small and handy to pack and use. I was constantly loosing my Wifi connection from a local supplier until installing and using this mini-dish antenna. The has been the answer to my program and I am now a very happy and satisfied user of this good looking unique product. It was received as advertised in a timely fashion. I am a firm believer of buying products from Company A.com. I find what I need, can read reviews from previous buyers for their opions, and am assured of prompt delivery as requested. This is a quality product for a reasonable price."
3567,"The Logitech Driving Force GT racing wheel took me a while to get used to. It's not as precise compared to real-world driving as it claims to be, but after you get used to the handling and nuances of it, it really is fun and makes the perfect compliment to Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.The biggest point I do have to make about this, however, is that it's really designed for a gaming seat, and is a pain to use without one. The wheel is mountable on other surfaces, but we've had a hard time getting the perfect setup without an actual gaming ""driver's"" seat to compliment it.Other than that, it serves it's purpose and delivers on pretty much everything it claims, and we haven't experienced any glitches in gameplay or controls which is a major plus. I'd highly recommend this to anybody who's thinking of getting or already has Gran Turismo."
3568,"I thought this would be great player to replace my old sansa e250 considering its mediocre 'video' and picture display properties and I was very disappointed.  The player looks thinner but the battery is not user replaceable.  The screen quality looks better than my old e250 but still not as good as an ipod.  The screen resolution is 224x176 vs 320x240 on the ipod nano video.  The reception of the radio has improved compared to my e250.The audio quality has greatly improved compared to my old sansa e250 and even an ipod.  I can't believe they still use the archaic Sansa media converter to handle video and picture synchronization.  I was really hoping that you can create your very own .mp4 file and .jpg instead of an .bmp files and sync to this sansa fuze player.  In the middle of synchronizing a couple of pictures, Sansa media converter crashed.  When I rebooted the mp3 player, the mp3 player is stuck on 'Refreshing Your Media' screen so I had to go to msc mode and format the sansa fuze.  The picture quality is better than the e250 but not as good as the ipod.  The menu screen is not very customizable and the only thing you can change is the screen color and not a picture of your choosing.  I tried playing some videos, but it is really mediocre but at least it is better than the mjpegs that the sansa e250 uses.As the way I see it, the Mediocre screen and weak video playback makes this player little more than a sansa clip with an color screen with an expandable memory.  I doubt that it could compete with an ipod nano video unless they do something about the screen and video quality."
3569,"Bought this together with a Audiovox Onyx XDNX1V1 radio unit.  (NOTE:  The XMBB1 does NOT include the radio!)  So far, I am pretty happy with the performance of both.  Although not obvious from what I could find in the descriptions, the XMBB1 does include an AC adapter, and also an antenna (see my uploaded pictures), and it does seem to work with the Onyx XDNX1V1 despite not explicitly listing it - perhaps because that radio head is newer?The XMBB1 is nicely built and works well, but has a few issues as others have mentioned.  The sound is pretty good.  I tried it with both the XM radio head and with an Ipod.  Not perfect fidelity, but pleasant.  There is no tone control (unless the radio head you buy has one), and the volume control needs more resolution.  With the iPod, this was not an issue since I can control both tone and volume from the iPod unit itself.  But with the Onyx radio, the volume in the radio seems to be linked to by the XMBB1, so that you can't use both.  And what you get is something that cannot be turned down to a very low level.  Low, but not real low.  So if you want whisper-level sound, you'll have a problem.  At the loud end of the range, I felt there was plenty of volume for indoor use.  The fixed tone from the combined XMBB1/Onyx is OK, but I would like it somewhat brighter and I feel there is a bit heavy weighting in the mid-bass region.  But it's fine for most listening...Reception indoors with the antenna mounted on the back of the box is mixed.  I tried it in several locations in our 1-story ranch house, and it worked in most, though you have to have the antenna tilted up and you need to have the back of the radio facing somewhat south.  In the basement where it had to look through more wood and carpet structure (or though cinder-block) it was *very* marginal (not receiving in most locations).  But that is to be expected for a satellite receiver.  That's why you get a really long cord on the antenna ;-)Overall, if you are Ok with these imperfections, I feel like this is a solid unit and worth the price.(One side-note about the reviews saying they could not control the volume.  I had an odd problem the first time I tried the radio with the XMBB1.  I had reception, but no sound.  Re-seating the radio fixed it and it has worked since then.  Maybe there is a connector issue with some units??)"
3570,"I also have a Manfrotto 3021 tripod which is fine but a little long & heavy for hiking with.I have 2 Lowepro camera backpacks - both with attached tripod carrier and the 190CXPRO4 folds up small, is much lighterand makes my hikes much easier.It also is more flexible & quicker to adjust for getting down low for macro shots or pulling the center columnout to position/angle for other shots. I had a recent shoot that I was standing off to the side on top of a waterfalland was able to adjust the tripod so that it was overhanging & positioned directly over the waterfall.I did add a bit of weight to the tripod but it was good & sturdy and made for an easy shoot. I would have liked the Gitzobut at over twice the price, I dont see twice the quality and am very happy with the price & performance of this tripod.I carry it with me everywhere and so far I have not encountered any problems. It opens/closes and adjusts quick & easy.Works with my Canon 100-400mm L lens and with my Manfrotto 468MGRC2 Hydrostatic Ball Head, makes for a sturdy combination.[...]Update: Well after 3.5 years of continual use, one of the legs popped out as I was extending them to set up a shoot. It still functions but not as sturdy as it was. I will contact Manfrotto and ask what they suggest I do to get this fixed. Changing my rating down to 4 stars."
3571,Works on Windows 7 easily for me. Just plugged in and worked after windows installed drivers. It does have to be manually focused though. But for so cheap focusing it once is fine.
3572,"The product may come off as chinsey due to the fact that it's an off-brand electronics item. This fact also lays way to techno-fobia in the light of getting taken for a ride on a piece of scrap.While not Logitech or Microsoft branded the headset is quite good. The unit was immediately recognized by Vista. The microphone was instantly set as the primary recording device and the headset stereophonic speakers automagically became the primary audible output device as well. I had zero percent setup tasking as the system went in smoothly. Quite the plug and play scenario.The headset harness is somewhat large and accommodating for the cranially excessive but, the less skull mass inclined might want to invest in a pad for the the crown harness.The speakers can be excrutiatingly loud which is good considering that all one has to do is turn the things down. The magic of science and what is known as a volume control. The speakers have an extraordinary frequency range for a less known device like this and the sound is crisp with excellent fidelity.The mic is somewhat annoying as it is not a solid boom but a flexible bendy-boom where you'll have to take a minute or two to adjust it bringing it in for optimal performance. There isn't allot of feedback from the mic in the headset but upon setting up the mic with Windows through a test of the voice recognition system you will see that the mic works really well.For just over $20 it goes without saying that this is one of those sleeper buys with great value for the money.I gave this item 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the head harness is a bit unwieldly. Outside of this solitary issue the item in question is of an excellent value. Anyone not excedingly concerned about a snug fit but, are instead looking at the item from a performance basis could ascertain that a proper rating of 5 out of 5 stars is accurate."
3573,This HDMI splitter does the job of splitting the high definition signal to two different places. It's powered by an AC adapter.
3574,Good price and good product. I have a pair of Cambridge soundworks Ensemble 2 speakers -  they are quite heavy for their size.  You'll need a good Alan-Key and some elbow grease to tighten the clamp around the ball if you're speakers are heavy but otherwise these are inconspicuous and fabulous for that.
3575,"I prefer this unit to my Garmin and Navigon for long trips because it doesn't bother me with as many annoying ""Turn Ahead"" messages for mere bends in the highway and such.  I prefer the Garmin for local trips because its routing seems a little better, and its live traffic seems better based on my small amount of usage.The first time I tried using my ""Lifetime Map Updates"",it screwed my TomTom Go730 up completely. When I turned it on afterwards, a simulation of my route would flash by on the screen so fast that I had to turn it off-and-on three or four times before I could make out my next turn. Simulation mode was NOT turned on, and pushing the reset button had no effect at all.  Later, it got frozen in some ""data dump"" mode, and neither the on-off button nor the reset button had any effect.Finally I stuck an SD card into the card slot and ran the download again; everything worked perfectly, and I am back in business.  The I.Q. Traffic feature doesn't seem very effective to me, plus I thought that what they call HD Traffic was a part of IQ Traffic and was disappointed to find out I was mistaken.  HD traffic actually takes data from TomToms out on the road (""crowdsourcing"") and uses that to modify the routing recommendations they send to your unit."
3576,Bought this for my Canon Pritnter so I could make it wireless. Was easy to install and setup was quick. Very nice product for the money and worth the extra you spend for it to make your printer wireless.
3577,"Mirror is fine but I had to purchase two bolts to attach these to my 2001 SV650S clip ons. The included bolts and attachment hardware were too big. I ended up using an M10, 1 1/2 inch oval head machine screw to directly attach these. Over all I'm satisfied with these once they're mounted. They're solid and the view is fine."
3578,"A really underwater rig would cost you $1000's so for a few shots in the surf zone or in a pool it is very cool.  But it is cheap, it can leak, and it is hard to use your camera.  But IT WORKS.  I tested it down to 3ft in my pool and everything was good.  However, I would never trust the seals on this so always keep an eye on it and get it out of water as fast as you can.  It is not for diving, but you wanted to take some picture while surface swimming this will work."
3579,"I was looking for an inexpensive FM transmitter for my android phone.  This works well so far.  It's fairly cheap construction, but what would you expect from something you pay $5 for?My only complaint is that it came with a one foot 3.5mm cable that was so poorly manufactured that it made intermittent connections in my phone and was essentially unusable.  A one foot cable is almost unusable in the car anyway...since you can't put your phone more than 1' from the cigarette lighter.  So, I'd suggest ordering a 3' or longer cable from Company A or monoprice if you plan to use that feature."
3580,Used in my home theater system - sound is excellent and just what I was expecting.  Size was a concern because I installed it in a small cabinet.  It fit perfectly and the sound exceeded my expectation for the size of the unit.  I probably should have upgraded one step for some of the additional features but I could not justify the additional cost although now I would reconsider spending more for the extra felxibility.
3581,"I enjoyed that this pair of headphones came with a mic that is long enough to reach your mouth. I've used it on Skype and Dragon Naturally Speaking and my voice some out very clear.The only small problems were that the mic only flexes in one direction and that the construction feels a little bit shaky. If you are looking for a good pair of headphones w/mic and on a budget, this will be all you need."
3582,"I purchased this to backup the files on my PowerMac G4 tower Mirror Drive Door model.  I used the firewire cable because this Mac only supports USB 1.1.I tried the Lacie software to format the drive, but it stopped responding after completing about 95% of the status bar.  The program stopped responding, so I tried to ""kill -9"" (unix command to end the process) the program, but it wouldn't die. This necessitated, of all things, a hard reboot.  I re-attempted the process again with the same results.I was very disappointed and thought I had a defective drive here.  I then took this firewire version and connected it to my Macbook Pro, used Apple's Disk Utility to reformat it and now everything seems fine.Because of this, I ended up setting up a share and copying all of my files over my network from the PowerMac to this drive connected to my Macbook Pro.Perhaps my firewire controller is going bad on the PowerMac...or perhaps the LaCie program doesn't play nice with non-Intel Macs."
3583,"If you don't want to run cables and physically place the speakers in different places , this Speaker is for U .What it gives you is 5 speaker system in One Single Speaker Bar. It is not only the one speaker . It is the Sound Quality coming out of the Speaker Bar . Its Amazing Technology and Audio Quality is Superb .Don't get fooled by the size of the Speaker Bar when compared to 5 physical Speaker . This bar gives you a GOOD Quality Audio output .My Setup : Sony Bravia 55"" , Denon AVR 3310 , Klipsch Subwoofer 10"" and the DT SSA-50 Silver .I watched some of my favoriete movies again and i was thrilled . I was thrilled by hearing new audios which i used to miss earlier . ( Some movies : Kung fu Panda , Toy Story , How to train your dragon , Die Hard 4 etc ) .I give 5 star for Audio Quality coming out of MoviesI give 4 star for Audio quality coming out of Audio SongsI give 3.9 star for the Speaker net . (Black color in front of the speaker ) . It is of O.k Quality .Overall 4.5 STAR because of Sound quality ."
3584,"These are nice. I like how thick they are , but they give up some transparency because of it. I like the size because they work great with thicker  double albums and allot of the new 180 grm and more pressings. The extra weight of the cover works very well for that also. Can't tell you how many thinner ones I have had to switch out over the years. These look like they will hold up well."
3585,Very nice. The other review I read were very helpful and on the money about it.  It is a little heavy and you would think in this day and age they would figure a way to use smaller batties in stead of the big 'C'. Over all it is a good buy if you are looking for a nice shower radio.
3586,It was quite use full for what I needed it for. Two bad it wasn't rev &#34;B&#34; code. I could of used it in First! ;-)
3587,"My iphone 3g battery is not that good. I think every iphone users are facing the same issue. Though I dont use the iphone extensively in a day for gaming and browsing, still, it needs one charge a day. So I was in market for one portable battery pack which I would use in camping and outdoors when a car charger is not available. And i am pleasantly surprised. This battery pack is very slim, you can charge the battery pack in yoru car too if you have the blackberry or motorola charger. iphone car charger will not work with the battery pack as the input is the small usb type.I am giving it 4 stars because it only gives me less than 2 full charges in the Iphone. Otherwise very handy and very sleek."
3588,I ran these all the way to end of driveway to watch the road and I see no degradation in video quality from the shorter runs.I'm using the non-infrared bullet cams also. I have found these work well behind glass.I may buy more!
3589,"Got this for my son after his got slurped into the void, along with dozens of other items of varying price.  It works well.  The usb connector is a bit unwieldy, but it slips nicely into a slot in the bottom of the mouse when not in use."
3590,"Item works great as intended, annoying that it takes more time then I would like to place onto flash, I took one star off because plastic loops holding on the velcro ripped easily after several uses over the last couple months, making this not a very probable long term product."
3591,"I have had the Logitech indoor camera for at least 2 years.  My son helped me install it.  I had to call the customer service line once for help with the installation.  They were helpful then, and once while it was under warranty the plug-in part malfunctioned and they figured out what the problem was and shipped me a new one.  Since then the camera has been on for 24 hours a day and works fine.  My only complaint is that you must have good light to be able to see the picture and I would prefer to have a much smaller camera."
3592,"Reason I am giving it only 4 stars: Plays only 3 formats (MP3, Real audio, third I don't remember), none of which are HD formats (but if you are not audiophile not a big deal, still sounds impressive). Connectivity to internet radio stations is flawless. Connectivity to your PC (streaming music from PC) - well, most of the time flawless, but I believe if a problem occurs most of the time is your Windows giving you trouble...;-)). Otherwise highly recommended, great gadget."
3593,It has a nice flexible outer covering and a sturdy looking zipper.  The only complaint is that it is a little difficult to secure the cds in place with the plastic tab.
3594,"If your wallets aching and you need a 2 Gig Micro SD, buy this and it won't add any damage to your finances!"
3595,My 9 & 10 year old girls really like these.  Say they fit their head well (they are smaller than adult size headphones).  I'm not using the audio max volume control.  I reccomend for children.
3596,Works well with my &#34;Terrestrial Digital DB8&#34;. Some channels it pulls in nicely...others not so much but does increase signal quality in &#34;not so great&#34; weather. I like it and I'd recommend it to someone who asked.
3597,"Got this a few days ago. Very easy to configure. Had mine set up on my wireless network in minutes. Much better video quality than I expected for this price.Definitely meant to be used indoors in low light. When I point it out the window, the image just washes out and goes all white. But indoors, with normal lighting, the image is great. Night time image is very good. The built-in IR LEDs work well to about 20ft or so. Beyond that, things are pretty dark. I tried an experiment and turned on a desk lamp with a very low power fluorescent bulb and the camera had enough light to see everything in the house in full color. Really good low light performance.The microphone is also very sensitive. Almost too sensitive. It picks up every sound in the house. I can hear the ceiling fan, air conditioner, TV in another room, people talking in other rooms etc. Has 2-way audio but haven't tried it yet. UPDATE- two way audio works great. You need a powered, amplified speaker; I used an old computer speaker.Super easy to operate. You don't need any special software to remotely view, just Internet Explorer. You can view with Firefox, but you lose some features. When viewing remotely over the Internet, you can click on any point in the image and the camera centers itself on that point.Tons more options and features but, you can read about them on the manufacturers website.If this had a true optical zoom, it would be just about perfect but, full Pan Tilt and Zoom cameras cost a lot more than this one.I am pleasantly surprised with this camera. I've tried several 'affordable' cameras over the past few years and have been quite disappointed with them. The only really good network PTZ I've found is a nine hundred dollar Panasonic. Too expensive for me and it does not have audio.If you need audio and full range pan ant tilt, but don't need zoom, this is probably your best choice right now for any price. Panasonic makes a nice, small, wireless camera with audio and pan and tilt but it does not have the range of motion that this camera has and this camera has much better low light image quality.REVIEW UPDATE- I've had mine now for several months and it still works great. I changed the video setting to ""outdoor"" and now it works perfectly in full sunlight. And it still works just as good in full dark as it did with the other video settings. I was having some problems with the camera losing it's wireless connection to my Linksys router. I would have to power cycle the camera to get it to reconnect. But then I started having other problems with the Linksys router so I replaced my old Linksys router with a newer D-Link router and the problems have gone away. The camera has not lost it's connection since I replaced the router.Because this camera is IR sensitive and does not have a switchable mechanical IR filter, daylight images sometimes look a little fuzzy, as if the lens is dirty. This is most noticeable when viewing indoors with a lot of sunlight coming in through the windows. I have other IR sensitive cameras and they exhibit the same behavior.Overall, I am still quite pleased with this camera and just wish Company A would make it a Gold Box deal so I could get another one!Company A recently put the Panasonic BLC131A wireless network camera on sale for about 1/2 price so I got one to try. The Trendnet TV-IP422W is far superior to the Panasonic; it has much better image quality, sound quality and range of motion, and the Trendnet configuration screens seem much more intuitive to me.If Trendnet would add a zoom lens and a mechanical IR filter, this camera would be perfect."
3598,she loves it I was a little scared buy other reviews and handles on basket. All I can say is they must have filled machine up to much Have not problems at all!1
3599,"I had this set up within a day. I was using it with a DirecTV receiver and after I had to configure a third party application to do the IR blasting to the box for channel changes it worked great. Other than that I had no problems with this thing. Media Center work well with it and I didn't have any problems.UPDATE: I have since moved on from this to the new Xfinity X1 system, very much like Media Center anyway and I don't have to take care of it when the wife complains that something doesn't work."
3600,"I bought this adapter to pair with a new set of stereo bluetooth headphones.  These were the steps I ended up going through to make things work:- Plugged it in and let Windows 7 install the auto-detected drivers from Windows Update.  This seemed to work ok and Windows claimed the adapter was installed successfully.- Paired the headphones (Motorola S305) and they paired, but Windows tried to find specific drivers for the headphones but couldn't find any so Windows said there was a problem it couldn't resolve, and Motorola doesn't have specific drivers available... so they didn't work.- Searched on the internet, and lots of people had this problem with these headphones.  Just as I was about to start the return process, I decided to install the drivers off the BT adapter's included disc to see what might happen.  Lo and behold this installed generic headset profiles which allowed the headphones to connect properly.- I load up Pandora and after I set the headphones to the default audio playback device audio started playing through them, but the audio quality was terrible.  Sounded like it was a 1 kbps streaming AM radio station or something.- So again I'm getting ready to return the lot, but I first downloaded the latest drivers from Iogear's website.  After I installed THOSE drivers and restarted the computer (and re-paired the headphones) everything was fixed and they were working as expected.So this adapter seems to work OK, after you get the latest drivers for it.  4 stars because the drivers included don't seem to work properly and the Windows Update drivers are incompatible."
3601,"I have owned 2 copies of this lens and both of them were good copies, but really needed to be calibrated my sigma service. I sent them in and they came back sharper than ever! Sigma's reputation is beginning to change at its quality control and support.My first copy was of the original shimmery painted finish, the current copy that I have is of the slick glossy finish.The autofocus is consistent and accurate. The Bokeh is gorgeous and vignetting is well controlled. It shipped with a lens pouch that is good quality.I use this lens when I shoot weddings and I trust it completely!"
3602,"Great price, good quality binoculars, plus warranty.I think that pretty much sums these up.  They don't fog up too much and don't have the best quality lenses in low light conditions (break of dawn hunting and twilight hunting).  But for the average user these are just fine, because you're not spending $200+ on some binoculars you're barely going to use anyway!"
3603,"These are great quality little speakers for the money and they sound very good. I, however, put them in a larger room about 6 feet apart and do not get much sound separation. Wish I had gotten the Polk FX A4 surround sound speakers with offset tweeters to better fill up the room with sound."
3604,"I was looking at the other expensive brands, but ended up getting this because of the reviews.The item is very sturdy.  Does not look cheap!Came with a bag/pouch for storing when not in use.Adjusts easily.Thread comes in two different sizes, so you can get a ball head with a 1/4 size thread or larger."
3605,"1510 is my all around case, use it from play to work and fits most needs i have in  a smaller case !The padded dividers are easy, the velcro very strong and variations many !as i have three 1510s i can switch it easy between cases and add or substrac storage units !The Case itself, tough as Pelican should be, smooth to handle, locks fine , sturdy grips ,the pull out handle a bit flimsy but i carried the case full loaded up the stairs and not trouble with that neither !Added a polster for the grip though !The rolls are good even for uneven ground !i added a Lid Org. and now it is a perfect 1/2 day Carry on case !!"
3606,This is not an exciting product but the cable is well made and looks like it will last forever.  It arrived quickly.
3607,"Happy with the product, very good price for the money.Good product, reasonable price. Wish they make the cable slightly longer."
3608,"Got this for a helluva steal at $13.99!!.. If I had one wish..? 5 more feet... 30 Foot HDMI would have done me better, but the next size up was over $30 I think... drastically more expensive, anyway."
3609,"The software which came with the card would not recognize that the card was installed, so I called the support line. The tech was very knowledgeable, but had a very strong Chinese accent, and several times I had to ask her to repeat a sentence.Without the software, there is no way to get the MAC address of the card. As silly as it sounds, it is not printed anywhere on the card or literature. I had to turn off MAC filtering, connect, and then get the MAC address form the router. I then added the address to the filter, and re-enabled MAC filtering... a hassle which should not be necessary.The card has functioned very well, and has a full signal from my 'n' router from ~40 feet."
3610,"I had a old IDE hard drive I removed from my broken computer.  It had lots of photos and music I needed to extract and copy to my new computer. This adapter worked great and was simple to use. I just plugged the old hard drive into one end of the adapter and pluged the other end into the new computer via a USB cable.  After attaching the power supply (provided) I could see the contents of the old drive on my new computer. Even though I probably won't need this gadget again, for a mere $17, it was soooo worth it. The only problem I ran into, was the USB cable included in the package was defective.  It took me several hours of fidgeting to figure this out but one I used a new cable, the device worked perfectly.  Also, I was disappointed with the lack of a technical support number to call a speak to a live person. The instuctions/website only offer support via email.  One other thing, as some reviewers mentioned...I had to completely remove the jumper from my western digital drive in order for the computer to recognize it."
3611,Got processor on time.  Dropped it in and worked with no issues.  Should have shipped in anti-static bag.  But it works and that's all that matters.
3612,Just wish it had a little more range but it does work right up to the specifications not an inch more!!
3613,"I bought 2 to stream video from 2 composite sources simultaneously.Had them both up and running in Company Ep3 within 15 minutes of opening the shipping container. Very simple, follow the directions: hook em up, put the cd in, let XP search for the drivers & install keep hitting ""automatic"" and away you go. Change the camera config to NTSB from PAL if you're in the US like me.Win 7 was a little more tricky, I hooked it up, win7 tried to install some default drivers for video capture devices, they didn't install correctly, following the prompt I removed the adapter, that didn't solve anything so I hooked it backup, went into DM & updated the drivers by pointing to the drivers on the cd-rom and then forcing it to install the unsigned drivers, then rebooted and it worked. Not too difficult. Not trivial either. But this is standard fare for xp drivers in win7.The units seem to be built well though they could use a standoff for side USB ports on a laptop, seem to be working like a charm...my only complaint is that at 30fps it's easy to see scanlines in the video when something moves through the camera FOV. But that could be the camera. I've definitely seen better video but this isn't too bad. The drivers are somewhat limited in the resolution options, my camera has 500-odd lines and none of the listed resolutions match this. So there's some black at the top of the video.For the money it's a steal. If you are worried about flexibility or upgrades I'd have to look elsewhere. But then at $10 for one of these it's a safe & cost-effective fallback option. They definitely work and they definitely are cheap."
3614,Covers are good. Use these to take cds to car instead of covers that cds come in.Good for purpose intended.
3615,"April 2, 2009: This is good.  This dropped the minimum focal distance on my A100 to about an inch, and gave good expansion.  Image quality was generally clear and undistorted.  I didn't use a square calibration map to verify exactly, but after all, this is an add-on filter-type lens and not an entire assembly, so that's more bother than it's worth.Feb 9, 2010: For a little less, and stepping down in brand name, you can get a +1, +2, +4 and 10x diopter filter set with a bag.  Effectively, you get this 10x, plus 3 extras, and a cheap bag, for about $8-$10 less.  The product moves around, but as of Feb 2010, it wasDigital Concepts +1 +2 +4 +10 Close-Up Macro Filter Set with Pouch (55mm).  Your search term is ""55mm macro filter set""."
3616,"I looked at newer ones, and these seem to be missing one of the options in the book but still works fine."
3617,"I bought this knowing that this is the end of the line for Pioneers' big-screen TVs, and also knowing that this TV is approaching almost 2 years old since it's original release date.  But from all the reviews, the KURO '20-series was the one to get for its deep ""blacks"" as well as its vibrant, rich colors.After a month, I have not been disappointed neither.  The picture is absolutely STUNNING.  No pixelation, blockiness or graininess, nor ghosting or strobing.  Just breathing taking detail and fluid motion.  I've looked at Sony Bravia's and Panasonic's, but after watching the latest in Blu-Ray movies on this stunner, I have been taken aback by its crystal clear and silky beauty of its 60 inch video presentation.  None of the others has compared next to this majestic beast.  And it hasn't yet been calibrated, which is scheduled in a couple weeks.I won't go into all the technical reviews of this machine as I'm sure you can find much more eloquently and technically accurate writings elsewhere.However, I will go into a little nitpicking that was not mentioned by anyone else during my research.1) The audio Digital Out (optical) only passes 2-channel (stereo) Dolby Digital or PCM.  I was annoyed when I first hooked up my PS3 HDMI to the KURO, then the KURO digital out to my AV receiver only to hear stereo.  After contacting Pioneer, I discovered to my disappointment that the KURO only passes 2-channel.  In fact, I found out that practically all TVs that include a digital out send only 2-channel.  (sigh)  I had to connect an optical cable from my PS3 directly to my AV receiver to enjoy anything beyond 2-channel.  Unfortunately, I do notice just a slight audio timing shift from the video image.  Almost imperceptible (and for most people, unnoticeable), but I do notice it.  On top of that, I have more cables to mess with, as I have a DirecTV box and Xbox 360 in addition to my PS3, which means I have to have 3 optical cables going directly to my AV receiver (and ensure I switch to the right input on the AV receiver), which I'm lucky to say has more than enough optical inputs to handle this mess.  If the Digital Out could pass the full, unaltered audio stream then it would require only 1 cable going to the AV receiver and setting it to the same input regardless of what I was showing on the KURO, or maybe it's time to invest in a multiple-HDMI-input AV receiver (money, money, money)...2) The programmable remote is rather unremarkable and difficult to read in low-light situations (especially for those that are far-sighted).  But who are we kidding; if you are one of those that spends $4k+ on a TV then you probably also have a high-dollar third-party remote (the Harmony One for me) to control all your big ticket toys.  I keep the factory remote safely tucked away for emergencies.3) The on-screen interface is spartan.  There aren't too many features to change on this machine.  I do wish that it had auto-sensing inputs, like the Sony Bravia's, which would clearly indicate which inputs and type have connected devices on them.  When I initially powered-up the monster, I had to go to the back and refresh my memory which ports are the HDMI ones I used (the back HDMI inputs are 4 through 6, with port 7 HDMI on the left side).4) Sound quality was very good for two-speakers, but no where near capable of a true 5/6/7.1 surround system.  Again, if you forked over $4k for this behemoth, you probably also have a killer audio system to go with it.  I do wish that the front speakers could be set as an input to handle the center channel, like my deceased Mitsubishi Diamond 65"" RPTV.  Instead, I have to hang an independent center speaker below the built-in speakers (I don't usually use my audio system when watching regular TV so I need the built-in speakers to work).5) Be careful what you wish for.  The blacks are the ""blackest"" I have ever seen in a TV.  Unfortunately, I also noticed that some scenes can get too dark to discern certain details (for instance, the bold black headline of a newspaper in the shadow such as in the movie, ""The Watchmen"").Besides those points, I am completely satisfied with its video performance.  And with the ""discontinued"" signs beginning to be foisted on this last-of-its-kind, killer deals are sure to be had for those wanting the best."
3618,"This camera works quite well on my mac mini (intel core 2 duo, 1.83GHz).  It was trivial to install and use and the picture and sound quality are good for a camera in this price range.  My only complain is that it uses a lot of CPU when in use (maybe 20%) which seems high compared to the built-in isight camera on my imac (this is the only reason I do not give 5*).  Construction quality is good and the camera is cute."
3619,"Well, I've changed my mind.I'm writing this review June 3, 2013 to update my criticisms with having received the wrong product. Although I discovered that, somewhere down the road, Company A refunded my order, I was still miffed at having received the wrong thing, and having it break. I wrote an appropriately negative review (see below) originally voicing my complaints, and others seemed to echo my sentiments.Then, earlier today, I get a call from a California area code number that I don't recognize. Turns out it's Steve Kaeser, the seller whom I purchased from, and he's calling to right whatever wrongs Company A may have committed in the fulfillment process. He mentioned to me that this 'sending the wrong item' is something that they're talking to Company A about fixing, that the fault is on their fulfillment, and that he'd like to send me these all-metal stands directly so that I may receive what I'd originally ordered.Another phone call later, we discover that my order had been refunded (as it was on my credit card, I hadn't checked the statements for a refund yet). Kaeser, still wanting to have me appropriately review the product, insists upon sending me a set of stands as a replacement for my plastic ones.This is why it's important to pay attention to what sellers you buy from: because if (and when) anything goes awry, it's down to the customer service of the seller to solve the problem. I had all but written off these stands, the seller, and purchasing anything equivalent on Company A. Then I got that call.Excellent customer service from an honest business with a real genuine care for the consumer, that's Steve Kaeser Photographic. Hands down the best 'customer service' experience I've had from anything relating to Company A._________________________________________________________My first review, published in April (for context, although my comments here don't precisely still stand):These stands were purchased following the recommendation from a friend who received a great product from PBL. My experience was not so. Not only were my stands NOT all metal, as described and pictured, but they broke almost immediately upon mounting my expensive ARRIs on top of them. One doesn't telescope/open at all, and the other telescopes without locking.An absolute waste of money and a purchase which cost me even more in lost time and money. Terrible, buyer beware._________________________________________________________Back to the new review:For now, I'm leaving things at 4 stars, up from my initial '1'. I haven't (obviously) received the new stands yet, but will be happy to update my review to 5 stars following some use and test of them. At first, not so happy with the product I got, but now very happy with the transaction. Would do business with them again, easily."
3620,"I was immediately happy with this system after I got it set up.It's very clear, loud and has good highs and lows to it.  It was nice having all my equipment run through this and then just a single cable to the TV (this was my first system with a receiver).  The calibration of it was pretty quick and easy and still sounds good from other listening positions.  The remote was pretty useless but most people will have a universal one anyway.After about a year the receiver started having problems with the ""handshake"" of HDMI signals coming in to it.  This means that when I turn my DVR on it would take about 10 extra seconds to get the signal worked out.  That was a slight annoyance.  Over time it got worse and worse to the point that several minutes to come on.  This was more annoying.  Lastly it go to the point where it would not ever get the signal.  I had thought it could be several other things so I did some troubleshooting (replace DVR, replace cable, etc) but had the same problem.  My bluray player also experienced the same effects.After looking online I saw that this can be a problem with this particular receiver, so it wasnt just me.I still give it 4 stars because i got several good years of use from the receiver and the speakers are still installed, although with a pioneer receiver."
3621,"Really great product for the price.  Only marked down because, well, you get what you pay for."
3622,A little pricey but all and all a great amp set. Comes with everything you need and you don't have to worry about ground loops or anything. Don't be a cheapo and buy the garbage. Put it in right. This is right.
3623,I just couldn't believe how well these close up filters worked for the very low price I paid for them. I wanted them for a specific project that didn't require the need for a dedicated Macro lens. Boy was I surprised at the quality of the photos I was getting from these filters.I will always carry the Digital Concepts Filter Set with me during my outdoor travels as the portability is far better then carrying around a couple of dedicated macro lens and the photo quality was far superior to anything I had hoped for. I'm very pleased that I tried these filters and happy to add them to my bag of filters.
3624,"I purchsed the Garmin unit because I wanted to purchase an American made product. I have not compared it to other models made by TomTom, Magellan, or any of the other brands most consumers are not likely to recognize, but I did use my Garmin Nuvi 760 to its fullest.the features I like the most are bluetooth capability for hands-free cell phone use, points of interest, use of radio frequency to hear the Nuvi output, and the 'where am I?' function that marks your location so you can easily return to it later.This last function mentioned is great for times when you go to a state fair or park in an airport parking lot. When you leave your car, you use the ""where am I"" function then you can search for it when you need to find your car.the use of the radio frequency to hear the units turn by turn instructions, stored music, books, and other audio files is really fantastic. You can listen to your choice of music, audio book, or whatever you put on the device with no commercials. When the unit gives you a turn by turn instruction, it pauses the audio file currently playing and resumes when the command is finished. Very smooth.the points of interest (POI) are very helpful, especially when you are travelling. It works great with the cell phone function, too, because most POIs have an associated phone number that you can simply press and it calls the number. This particular function is vital since not all POIs are up to date and I have found that calling first can save a lot of time.The bluetooth hands-dree cell phone function is important in states where the law prohibits using a cell phone without a hands-free device. But, it's quite handy and pretty cool, to hear your caller on your stereo system while you talk normally. I had so much fun with it I occasionally made calls from my car just to use this function. It sounds great and it's really convenient."
3625,"I actually purchased this monitor back in November '08 and I returned it out of utter disgust, cause it looked absolutely terrible as a monitor. The washed out colors, blacks looked greyish-blue, etc. If you read many of the other reviews on here, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. However, I loved the TV portion. For some reason, the colors would change dramatically as soon as you switched over to the tuner. I sat for hours trying to figure out how to fix the colors for the PC, cause obviously it had the capability.Well, I gave up and like I mentioned, I ended up returning it mainly because the price didn't justify the performance. However.... a nice lil sale came around and I ended up buying this monitor one more time, cause I couldn't pass up a great deal. After a few hours of tinkering I figured it out!!!!If you have this monitor and are experiencing the greyish-blue looking blacks when using it for the PC, do these adjustments and it should fix the problem:With the remote, press ""menu,"" then go into ""Picture Options"" and change the color tone to ""warm."" This should immediately give u subtle warmer-cleaner looking whites, but still give u that annoying blueish tinge in your blacks.Now with the provided ""natural color"" software in the provided drivers cd, install the software and run the monitor calibration software.When you reach the portion that asks what type of lighting environment you are in, choose the following: House -> Incandescent -> Low Lighting.This should fix any greyish or blueish blacks. Although u won't ever get that perfect black cause TN panels aren't capable of it, you'll have the next best thing and have similar blacks to the ones that are built into the tuner!Anyway, hope that's of help. This monitor is a sweat deal if you could live with TN panels."
3626,"Overview:I've been using this case for a full year now under construction/dusty conditions due to renovation. I've filled up all 80mm fan slots and it contains a full 12"" graphics card along with a 750W non-modular power supply.Pros:This case introduces proper air circulation that is non-existent in almost all other traditional cases. It pulls cooler air from the bottom left hand side, runs it over the hard drive bay and directly into the graphic card/motherboard while maintaining a vertical pull from two 80mm fans facing up and out the back of the case.The ability to house a full-sized ATX power supply is a huge advantage when running some heavy hardware. In my case, my power supply has a fan that ends up pulling air directly out of the CPU cooler (which I reversed so it pumps upward into the power supply) to keep the stock cooler running incredibly cool.Cons:Due to the one-direction air flow setup I have, the fans actually accelerate each other in a similar format found in jet engines. So naturally, based around this concept, it sounds like a jet engine that revs up and down based around the temperatures in the case. Quiet fans may solve this issue but for now guests who hear it comments on how they feel like my computer is going to lift off and fly across the room.And like what other reviewers have said, the blue indicator lights can double as orbital ion cannons. They quite literally can light up a good portion of a good sized living room with all the lights off. One easy fix is to put a dab of hot glue on where they show but it shouldn't have been this bright in the first place.Aside from the noise and the lights, this case is a solid purchase for any HTPC builder (or anyone who desires a small footprint Company K with room for two optical drives)."
3627,"We've had this unit now for about 6 months.  It works trouble free.  Two things to be aware of:  first, this is a very full featured unit and second ... it has an object oriented configuration model.  You essentially need to configure objects and then specify them as you configure various features.  Although the documentation explains features reasonably well, it did not explain the object model (at least not on our unit).  The user interface might take a bit of getting use to, but once you're comfortable with it ... this has been a good firewall / router / VPN for our small business.  We can recommend it."
3628,"Somewhat flimsy until you super-glue the sides and clasps together, but once that is done, it's a great little storage box for CDs/DVDs/whatever else you want to store away."
3629,so far so good- still cking it out- thought it would have the canon name on it ??? works ok for now ???
3630,Nice and cheap.  Works.  Great for travel.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would though.  Nice long cord.
3631,"I have been using the Creative HS-1200 Digital Wireless Gaming Headset for several weeks now, and I have generally been very satisfied with their performance.The headphones are comfortable to wear. Even though there is no noise-cancelling feature, these headphones still do a good job of removing outside noise, because they fit around my ears pretty well.The battery seems to last a long time, but when the battery does get low, the speakers play an annoying beeping sound, that doesn't go away until you recharge the headphones. Fortunately, however, the headphones can still be used while being charged. They charge through USB, using the same connector that is used for the receiver, which is nice.My biggest complaint with these headphones is that the range is not very good. The audio signal starts to break up when I go about 20 feet away from the receiver. (Although the signal does travel through walls, which means that the receiver does not have to be in line of sight of the headphones to communicate.) However, this is not much of a problem, since I am normally sitting at my computer or very close by when using these speakers.Another feature I like is that these headphones have built in volume control buttons on the side, which makes it easy to change the volume. Also, I frequently switch between headphones and external speakers for my computer, and these headphones allow me to make the switch easily, without restarting my computer, which was something I was concerned about since the only connection is through a USB port. I think these headphones are possibly a little expensive, but generally a good value."
3632,Worked great for my DSI flash cart. Put a whole bunch of games on it. No problems whatsoever. Would buy again.
3633,"I like to read the negative reviews and then think about whether I'm going to make a purchase (especially on a problematic item like an antenna).  I must admit, I almost didn't buy it.  But it's working great.  Tip:  I couldn't get a signal standing in the living room holding this antenna.  I did that with my last antenna just to get a feel for which way to point the thing (unfortunately, it was pretty flimsy and broke).  I couldn't experiment with the ClearStream4 until I got it up off the ground (in the attic).  I pointed it at the towers and mounted it.  I'm getting about 80% signal.  I'm sure if I mounted it higher the signal would be stronger, but why bother?  Working great right where it is."
3634,"I first purchased an optical audio cable from Best Buy for almost $30.00 but then I read up on these types of cables and returned that one - too expensive!  I ordered this one instead and it works great.  I was a little unsure that my old Bose Lifestyle 2500 system was going to interface with my new Blu-ray player, but this cable is all it took.  My Bose sounds better than ever !!"
3635,"I hesitated to buy this flash.  The SB-600 was dated and no replacement was rumored, and I really wanted to buy one flash one time and not have to think about it.  I purchased it thinking I was a non-professional and I would not run into the thermal shutdown issue.  I purchased ENELOOP NiMH batteries and I started shooting.  I've only experienced thermal shutdown twice - and that was with bounce flash + a very dark room + iso 200 photography with a 70 or 80 photos in a row.  If you set your camera to iso100 in a dark room and really push the flash, you can hit this really quickly but is that realistic?  I am disappointed that there is such a cloud of controversy surrounding it.  It may hurt resale.  My experience was that when the temperature gauge hits it's midpoint, you will quickly get to thermal shutdown in the next couple of photos.  The batteries were not even warm when taken out, nor was any part of the flash that I could touch.  Once shutdown occurs, you can not turn on the flash and get into the menus to turn off the thermal protection circuit until the unit cools down. Plan accordingly.  Either turn off thermal shutdown protection before and monitor the temperature frequently or plan to wait about 5 or 10 minutes for the unit to cool down.  If you are a pro, you probably have more than one flash anyway and can swap them though this is inconvenient.All in all, it is a powerful excellent flash.  It helps me make fantastic memorable photos.  If you can't afford a $2000+ full frame camera to shoot low light and high ISO, then having the best flash is the next best alternative.  Plus as you grow your photography skills and upgrade equipment, this flash will continue to serve you well.The flash has the nikon CLS (creative lighting system) so you can put the flash off-camera and shoot from different angles, or use an umbrella to get nice diffuse light.  It also comes with a ton of extras -- nice storage case, some gels for coloring the light coming out of the flash, a diffusion dome, a white bounce card.I definitely recommend this flash though I hope some day soon, Nikon issues a firmware fix or services these very expensive flashes and rids us of the temperature issues."
3636,"I'm a gadget geek so when my family travels, I have a lot of devices:-Two tablets-Two smart phones-Verizon mifiI use this to charge it. It works in 95% of the situations except if many of the devices are fairly drained and sucking a lot of amperage. Then the charger runs very hot and throttles amps. How do I know this? Some of the devices would cycle every few seconds between charging and not charging, beeping throughout the night.Still four stars because I think my situation is relatively unique."
3637,"Up till now, I have bought nothing but TDK and Verbatim discs. But, the prices go up and down like the gold-standard.I bought the Philips discs on the theory that price is really the only variable. Quality is generally good for all major brands, right?These discs have worked fine in my machines, but there are other issues. First, the tower is unlike any other that I have seen.The top (which has a fold-down handle), unscrews like a jar lid. It takes quite a few turns, maybe 10, before it comes off.A lot of bother compared to other designs. Second, I made the mistake of removing the plastic film label on the sides since these obscurethe number of blank discs remaining.But here, the label IS the tower's case-siding. Once the label is removed, the discs --all of them--are exposed to dust, spilled coffee, or whatever.One other annoyance is that the Philips brand labeling covers much of the disc space, leaving less for my own pen-labeling.If the discs are on sale, I'll certainly buy more since I can transfer them to other ""spent"" tower cases. But, all things being equal, I'll stick with TDK or Verbatim."
3638,"After having rec'd and unpacked my new Eee PC 1000H I ran it through several chores in which the little Asus was sweet!Fast boot time and after allowing it to download all new Windows updates I tried out some of the various programs. I bought the 1000H mainly as a carry along word processor because I do a lot of writing and a small, easy to tote, computer would be idea for me. Well, I had wondered about the keyboard size but was plesantly surpised to find that I could touch type with ease on the 1000H!However, the keyboard does have a flexing that is a bit unsettling but it stills performs well after getting use to the flexing.I hooked an external dvd/cd drive and loaded my MS map to it with no problems at all. I also tried out a DVD just to see how it performed and it did great--sound and picture were very good!All in all, this in one sweet little travel companion! If the keyboard didn't have the flexing I would have given it 5 stars.Also the battery life has been exceptional. A great machine for the buck!"
3639,"I purchased two of these for our two Fuze's.  It installs very easily, and has done a good job protecting the device.  The only downsides I see are the attachment for the clip and arm band leaves holes through the rear of the skin and the skin make it a little tough to slid the power button.  Other than that, it is thick enough to provide some cushion without being cumbersome.  I have found that if you put a piece of mylar packing tape over the screen before you put it in the skin, it protects the screen from scrathces and the skin keeps the edges of the tape from peeling.  I do this on my BB 8830 also and I can go months without having to replace the tape.  I would definitely recommend it."
3640,"Look closely at the pictures, the product is very good quality but it needs to be stated that the 110V side only works with a deep style wire box and the A/V side will not work with any box.  So to mount this item to the wall correctly, the installer needs to use a deep wall box for the electrical side and ten take a open frame style style mount for the A/V side.  Such an animal does not exist, so the best you can do will be to take a double gang deep wire box and cut away most of the back side on the A/V side.  Definitely a headache maker.But the benefits of eliminating 4 connections and 2 extra wires per connection more than make up for the headache once it had been figured out.  Otherwise, it looks good and the piece is actually pretty good quality."
3641,"Great mouse. Minus one star because when unfolded it does not quite bulk up to a full sized mouse, like a Logitech M510. On the plus side, this mouse works for Windows 7 and Windows 8. It also works, via an OTG adapter, with an android tablet. Not all wireless mice do (e.g. the M510) so if you want a wireless mouse for your android tablet I'd definitely consider this one. IF you want a compact travel mouse for a Windows laptop I'd also consider this one. Recommended."
3642,"I have been looking for a strap that will work with my think tank photo lens changer pouch worn on my belt. This is it! I'm 6'4"" and I've never owned a camera strap that is long enough. This one does it with room to spare. I love it. My only minor quibble is that instead of having 2 pockets to camera extra memory cards, I'd rather have one card holder and one battery holder."
3643,"When the batteries are fresh, this flash recycles very quickly. But the batteries drain quickly on an average shoot and then the recycle time lengthens noticeably. Using Duracell rechargable and setting the flash output to half power, I only get about 100 flashes before I find myself waiting a few seconds for the flash. I end up carrying lots of spare batteries so I don't have to wait."
3644,"I, like many others who have written a review, wanted a good point and shoot for those times when my Canon xTi(still a wonderful camera) or 40D with lenses, are too much to bring along. Additionally, I have arthritis in my hands, and sometimes I simply cannot handle my 40D.I had read many reviews of the Leica D-Lux 4, but I could not justify the price-even if I got the Leica name and leather case!. But seriously, I then did some research on the Lumix /country cousin of the Leica. I read ever review I could locate...pro and con. I realized that what I wanted, and what would suit my purpose was a compact w/ a wide angle..and the Leica lense in the Lumix would suit me. I went to the camera store and I held both cameras. Honestly, the Lumix is a little work of art. I liked it better than the Leica. It felt like the first Minolta my parents gave me in 1968; sturdy.  At any rate, I was impressed with the packaging, with the in box equipment, and the sheer beauty of this little gem. I have been shooting for years w/ SLRs and for the past four years with DSLRs, and to be completly honest, the picture quality (4x6) even at a higher ISO is void of noise. The shots are crisp and clear with detail I could not have expected from a point and shoot (but of course, there is the Leica lense). I know some reviewers are not happy with shooting results in RAW, but I did not purcahase the camera to get creative in this manner/I have the aforementioned cameras for this purpose. I have not tried RAW yet, but again, for my purposes, the camera is so far working well.  Now, for the technical issue I have with Lumix: In my opinion, the instruction book was written by someone whose first language is not English. If this camera is purchased by someone who has never owned a digital of any kind, I imagine there will be some frustration with plodding through the book. I have purchased many camera instruction books over the years to complement those that have come with my other camreas, and someone could write one for this camera. I figured out most of the menue selections because of being familiar with the Canon system, but I had to go on-line to locate some answers to a few of my questions. This being said, I recommend this camera as a suburb buy at under $450.  I just love it."
3645,"Before writing this review I have used this device for a few months and explored all available features including the USB feature.I had purchased the comparable Linksys N+ router and after several hours of frustration and tech support, I had to return it for a refund. I purchased this Belkin N+ router to replace it.  It setup fairly easy and functioned well right of the box.  It has some features the higher-priced Linksys didn't have, mainly a USB port for hooking up a network drive and a ""guest"" mode.  I have had to use the guest mode for configuring other network devices, such as a gizmo for watching internet on my TV.  I can also envision having family or friends over and turning it on temporarily for their use.  It is easy to turn guest mode on and off (and set the password) via the web interface.The USB network drive access is slow.  But I knew the limitations of USB speed before purchasing the unit so I was not disappointed.There are some areas for improvement.  It would be nice if the guest mode directed to a landing page after the user logs in.  It would also be nice to limit the number of guest connections and throttle the bandwidth speed. But it doesn't, so it has no commercial application.  I envisioned offering free wifi for my neighbors with limited connectivity (after viewing my ad on a landing page). You cannot do anything like this with this router.  Maybe someday a firmware hack or upgrade will be available but for now the guest function is limited in application to letting your mother-in-law access the internet without allowing access to the rest of your network.Another area for improvement is that the USB drive feature can not be directly accessed by the Windows Vista network.  To access the drive it is required to download an application onto your computer that accesses the network drive indirectly.  This means that you cannot use Windows Vista backup software on it.  I had envisioned using the USB drive option to backup my 3 computers via the network interface but since it is not a ""real"" network connection this is impossible.  You also cannot access the network drive from the internet.  You have to be connected to your home network and you have to use the Belkin Storage Manager.  There are third-party applications available to get around this (such as logmein) but the free versions cannot be used to transfer files.  The USB drive feature of the router is a nice addition, but it is not a true network drive option and I believe hardware limitations prevent it from every being one regardless of firmware updates.Speed:  I have not encountered a speed ceiling on this device.  It transfers data faster than my internet connection which is all a home user really needs anyway.  Using the USB drive hooked up it transfers as fast as the USB 2.0 is designed to do.Range:  Range is better than the N+ Linksys router.  While I have not tested the range I get a stronger signal with the Belkin than I did with the Linksys, however both routers had good speed at the same distance.Other:  I also hooked up a Brother wireless network printer to this router/network.  This is an ""advanced"" user type of thing and I am more of a mediocre user, however the hookup was fairly painless and has worked well.  I was able to setup the secure connection to the printer without using any cables which was quite a feat for me.While I am not entirely pleased with this purchase, it is a far superior product to the Linksys alternative in my experience both in performance and features."
3646,"Good lens to start with as both a wide angle and telephoto.  When you're using a telephoto, but need a wide angle you find yourself switching lens out in the middle of a tour.  It's a pain and you miss good shots.  You'll want a ""walk around"" lens.  One that does both.  I recommend the combination wide angle and telephoto Sigma 18-250 mm Macro.  The camera stores will try to sell you the Tamron, but be careful.  It's a good lens, but no better than the Sigma, and more expensive.  (I think they get a kick back.)  I use my Sigma more than my other lenses and am very pleased with the results.  Good luck!"
3647,"Basic router for home use, easy to set up, works as it should, both wired and wireless.  Range is just so-so, but its fine for an apartment.  No dropped connections or reliability problems."
3648,"Like most people who run across Drobo, I was introduced to this little gem when I asked a friend/colleague ""I'm looking at having a home NAS -- what do you recommend?""Unfortunately, out of the box, Drobo by itself is not a NAS (Data Robotics!  What were you thinking??)  However, everything else about the Drobo sounded like a dream come true.I've only had my Drobo for two weeks, so only time will tell with how it performs for me long term.  However, so far, I can tell you that I LOVE IT! and it works exactly as advertised.  It literally took me longer to unpack Drobo and the drives than it did to get it set up.  I plugged it in, and my PC (Windows XP SP3) recognized it right away.  The Drobo Dashboard software is not technically required to manage the Drobo, but it certainly helps by giving you a graphical representation of your hard drives and the space you are using.I bought two 1TB drives (WD Caviar Green) and it took about two minutes to format them NTFS and they were instantly available (for just shy of 1TB of available, usable space).  Just for fun, I pulled out one of my old SATA I drives (120GB) out of storage and popped it into Drobo.  It instantly recognized it and in about a minute, the light turned green.  I pulled up the Dashboard software and it was already available and my usable space bumped up to just a bit over 1TB!  AMAZINGLY easy.  There is zero configuration required of this device.  Just look at the lights and let it do its thing!The only thing that really bugs is that it doesn't come with built-in networking.  I know this has been mentioned a thousand times in reviews but it's just mind boggling why they wouldn't include it.  I almost dropped the extra[...] for the DroboShare, but the reviews on that are far less than stellar.  Apparently speed and stability of the network connection leaves much to be desired on the DroboShare (note: this is what I've read -- I've never used it before, so I don't have any first-hand knowledge of how well it actually works).  I've shared my Drobo using standard Windows sharing and it works perfectly like that.  I already leave my PC running almost 24x7 anyway, so this will have to do for now.  I am using mine via USB 2.0, as I don't have FireWire 800 (not many PCs do).Pros:-BRAIN-DEAD easy to set up and maintain.  Simply pop in a new drive, and Drobo does the rest.-RAID stands for Redundant Array of INEXPENSIVE Disks.  Drobo really takes that to a whole new level!!  Instead of having to worry about having drives of the same size, you can grab any old SATA or SATA II drive and Drobo will use it.  I bought two 1TB drives for redundancy.  It'll be a while before I reach that, but I know that when the day comes that I need more space, I'll just pop in whatever is cheapest (who knows -- it's likely that by then, there may be 4TB drives out at the price we pay for 1TB today).-VERY QUIET!  The WD Caviar Green are themselves very quiet running, and the Drobo itself seems to rarely use its fan, but even when it's on, and all of the drives are running, it's still barely a whisper.-Attractive -- the unit itself is very sleek looking, and I actually look forward to the day I use up more space so I can see some of those blue lights light up :-)Cons:-No built in networking.  What is up with that?  I wouldn't be AS concerned about this if the reviews for the DroboShare were better, but why would I want to spend an extra $200 to NAS my Drobo if it's not going to be fast or reliable?Other than the networking thing, I can't think of any other Cons.  With the ability to use any SATA or SATA II drive that you want, how can you beat this?  I'm not even listing the price as a Con.  Yes, it's a little expensive, but for what you're getting, this thing is phenomenal.Only time will tell.  We'll see how Drobo reacts when I have an actual hard drive failure (notice I said WHEN -- all hard drives fail.  It's just a matter of when).  Which leads me to another point -- I am very confident in Drobo's abilities to recover from a hard drive failure.  However, it cannot protect you from data corruption.  No RAID (or ""pseudo-RAID"") can.  If you get a virus, or if your kids or wife delete your precious files, you will still lose your data.  I am still searching for a good backup solution for my Drobo (no, Data Robotics -- I'm not going to buy another Drobo :-) --- yet!).I've done some minor performance testing: I've simultaneously copied large files to Drobo, streamed some music, AND streamed some video and it ran flawlessly.  That's about the most I've tested it on performance, but it seems just as reliable as any other USB 2.0 drive would be.I predict a long, happy relationship with my Drobo. :-)== UPDATE 6/3/2011 ==OK - I've been using this Drobo for well over two years now, and it has passed the test of time. I've since switched PCs and OSs twice now (from XP to Vistax64 to Win7) and am happy to report ABOSLUTELY ZERO ISSUES with Drobo to date. Since my initial review two years ago, I have added one drive, so I still have one empty bay. Moving from PC to PC and from OS to OS hasn't phased Drobo, and in fact, having most of my valuable data on Drobo (photos, music, videos) makes changing or rebuilding my OS a breeze, since I store very little on my primary hard drive (which is now an 80GB Solid State Drive). I frequently stream music and videos from Drobo (still on USB and sharing it out with Windows) and have never had any latency issues. I would gladly recommend Drobo to any of my family and friends.The only real issue I would say is that Drobo reports to Windows all potential space. When you first set up your Drobo, it asks (depending on your OS) what your maximum volume size will be. I chose 16TB for exapandability. So, my Drobo volume shows that it is a 16TB drive (even though I really only have 3TB of usable space). You have to use the Drobo Dashboard software if you want to know your real used/free space (or you can use the dummy lights on the front to ballpark what percentage of space you have free). It's a pretty minor thing, but it would be nice if Windows reported the actual volume information. I can definitely live with this, though.The only other ""issue,"" if you can call it that, is that it is difficult to back up, since the data on my Drobo is getting so big (a nice problem to have, I suppose) - to protect against data loss, corruption, accidental deletion, etc. When the day comes that I'm out of backup options, I will not hesitate to purchase another Drobo so that I can back one up to the other. Drobo has earned my business.== UPDATE 3/30/2012 ==OK, 3 years now with this unit, and I am still happy with it. I have run into a couple of issues here and there, but nothing I haven't been able to overcome, though one was very major. I accidentally turned on Windows System Restore on my Drobo volume and it literally made my Drobo inaccessible. It also made my PC inaccessible while the Drobo was plugged in. I had a major panic attack, but I do regular backups (about every week or two), and I did have a recent backup of my Drobo stuff, so I had to do a hard reset of my Drobo, essentially wiping out the drives and restoring it to factory image. I reformatted the drives, restored my backup, and all was well again. Things are actually better now -- I previously had my Drobo set to do a full 16 TB volume. When I reformatted it, I set it to do 8 TB volumes, and it has sped up my startup tremendously. I haven't hit the 8 TB mark yet, so I'll be OK for a little while. The only ""problem"" I have now is my backup solution is pretty much tapped out. I am considering purchasing a second Drobo (Drobo S) that I would use as my primary, then use this one (Drobo 2nd Gen) as a backup drive."
3649,"Smells a little funny at first from the type of rubber they use on the legs, but that seems to go away in a few days of being out of the bag. Construction is solid and easy to use. There was a little oil residue on the ball head when first shipped that needed to be cleaned off."
3650,"Love the legs and ease of use.  The level is particularly helpful.  The only issue is the ball head.  It doesn't appear to sit tight and level, so I have to adjust for that now and then."
3651,"Good - decent tripod for a price, above the average. for static shots.What I dislike. As amateur photographer on a budget, I needed universal tripod for most occasions.My previous one - 10 years old Vanguard 726 with panning head was perfect, but fell apart due to the age. So after reading reviews I decided to get Dolica.Took it for a test to my kid's soccer game and was disappointed a bit.I knew that ball-head does not have panning ability, but I didn't expect that will cause that much inconvenience - it takes too much time to change position of the camera on the tripod and secure it in new place - you have completely release the ball move it and tighten it up.It is pretty good for static shots - landscapes, still life, when you have time to settle it.It is pretty sturdy, unless you spread full extended tripod legs wide.Overall pretty good tripod, but if you need panning - don't expect this one will help at all."
3652,"This was one of a few options of PCI graphics cards for an old Midnight Dimension 2400 which I have connected to my Samsung LCD TV.  Installation was relatively easy, although it required me to upgrade the power supply unit to 300 W.  It greatly enhanced the resolution to match my TV's capability at 1080.  However, motion is still sluggish with HD content.  However, I realized this is related to CPU limitations which is a Pentium 4.  You should have at least a dual core CPU for playing HD content."
3653,Great keyboard prefect for kids.I plug it in and instantly recognized both keyboard and mouse.The mouse has water at the end and it lights up.The mouse pad seems a little cheap plastic. but it does allow you to put a family photo in it.and my only other complaint or suggestion was if they could have added a usb slot on the keyboard. being that I need the the cords that plug into the computer a little longer.
3654,"Yeah, it is expensive, but for sound quality, it is a great value. When I watch movies and DVD's with surround sound, it literally feels like I have more than the tiny speakers with the awesome output. The are compact and disappear on my entertainment center, projecting the sound to the rear (in fact, the best seat in the house appears to be my dining room, which is off to the side of my living room. The entire system is pretty compact, especially the speakers - but what power they punch! And it is pretty easy to set up which is great for a plug and play person like me - I just want to plug it in and have it work!Of course every product has its limitations - on my 321, sometimes I will lose audio and have to turn the entire system off for about 30 seconds to reboot - it is a pain to say the least. And I would have liked more audio inputs (or are they outputs - I am technically challenged) so that I can add a CD player that can hold more than a single CD at a time. Also - the audio level never is quite the same from application to application. If I just watched a movie then want to pop in a CD, the sound can be deafening if I forget to turn it down.  But the pros outweight the cons for me - I love hearing all those great sound effects that my TV just cannot capture."
3655,"I was looking for a set of earbuds that didn't tangle the way myV-Moda Vibe II Earbud Headsetdoes but which still blocked out sufficient noise to listen to my iPod on airplanes.  I bought these Ultimate Ears with high hopes, some of which were realized and some which were not.First, the sound quality of these earbuds is excellent, much richer than my V-Moda set.  Second, they resist tangling much better than any other ear buds I've owned.  The biggest difference between these Ultimate Ears and the V-Modas is getting the earbuds into my ear canal properly to block out exterior noise.  The smallest silicon covers on the Ultimate Ears are not as small as those on the V-Moda, so I have to wiggle a bit to get them in.  (Those with larger ear canals probably won't have this issue.)  Once in place, however, the Ultimate Ears block out sound enough to enjoy music on a plane.  The cord noise can be bothersome at times (again, not as bad as the V-Moda), but users should press the mike button first to make sure that they aren't accidentally adding to it through the microphone.This set comes with a hard plastic case, three sizes of silicon covers, and temperature-molding foam covers.  I really hate the foam because, again, I can't insert the buds properly, and it just feels uncomfortable. It took only a couple of hours listening to music through the foam and struggling to keep them in my ears to make me switch back to the silicon ones.Although these aren't perfect, I'm glad I bought them.  They are definitely better than what I was using previously.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
3656,"At the price listed here 100+ dollars, you can probably find something better. However I got the product from a popular website that sells one item a day for $30. It works pretty well. It had the codes for my 8+ year old Onkyo receiver and an older samsung TV. However it had issues trying to add additional buttons to the samsung controls. I needed to add a ""component/tv button"" as the AV/TV button on my TV only cycles between the S-Video, analog, AV1 and AV2 inputs but not the 3 component options. I was unable to do this (despite having my TV in its database the learning function refused to work), but eventually discovered that the ""enter"" button on the phillips remote was set to this functionality. So in the end it worked out okay.I was able to use the learning function to have it control both my Roku box and an IMPACT audio 3 component selector box just fine.The one thing that I don't like about the remote is that there is no way to quickly get to your macros. You have to hit ""home"" then select ""macros"" then select the macro you want. I wish I could add macros to the favorites menu, (which can be accessed through the ""user 1"" and ""user 2"" buttons at the top of the remote) but the only thing the favorites menu can store are channels. Kind of a dumb design move in my opinion but my no means a game-breaker.If you can pick one up for 30-60 bucks I would, however at this price look into a harmony, I've heard they are much easier to program with a larger database of devices."
3657,"Ordered this Combo after getting a Intel I7 with Window 7 gaming system.  I was disappointed not receiving the USB desktop extension.  The description on Company A.com is a little misleading.  The box did not indicate the extension was included. I almost return the item but decided to get it a try.Installation was very easy with Window7.  Pretty much plug in and play.  Keyboard comes with 2 alkaline batteries and mouse comes with a Eneloop rechargeable battery and both are ready to use. Window 7 recognized the keyboard and mouse without any problem.  I have the computer about 8-9 ft away and got the USB plugged in the rear of the computer and have no problem with the signal.  This is probably because the batteries are new.Keyboard and mouse are very comfortable to use.  But the short cut buttons are not fully compatible with Window 7.  Media Center button actually crashed the OS and computer rebooted. Media player buttons are great, which removes the hassle of using the mouse.  I will see if I can find a updated driver that help resolve the button problem.  This is the only reason I gave a 4 star rating.  Will update review in a few days."
3658,Confusing
3659,"Plug it in and it charges, what else could you ask for? The charging lights are bright enough to see in bright daylight. The flop down cover seems to get in the way and fall off so I just left it off for quicker access."
3660,"I tried the Hawking HWREN1 WiFi repeater at the urging of a helpful, knowledgeable, non-troll clerk (!) at the superstore whose name begins with F and rhymes with ""dies"", which is what my three previous Linksys WRE54G repeaters did-- those were total junk.  I'd had some previous experience with Hawking's products via a printer server several years ago.  That was a somewhat entry-level device, and support and documentation had been pretty pathetic, but it had mostly worked, so while I wouldn't have placed Hawking at the top of my preferred-vendor list, they didn't seem awful.  I'd done some googling on this item and the reviews were mixed, but so they were for all its competition.  So: shrug, decided to try it.Setup requires connecting the Hawking and your PC to your router with Ethernet cables, one of which is supplied with the Hawking.  This might be a problem if your router has only one Ethernet port, and it won't work at all if your router is wireless-only.With my PC and the Hawking cabled to my router, the (Windows-only) CD setup wizard and poster-sized quick-setup guide resulted in a working system in about five minutes, but with a separate SSID that would have confused and annoyed my family as they roam about our house with their laptops.  That's kind of a silly result; after all, you'd think most purchasers shopping for a WiFi network extender would want to extend their WiFi network, not set up a second one.A bit of googling suggested that others had had good luck with setting the SSID and channel the same as their main wireless access point/router.  So I tried that, using the device's browser-based configuration page, and it worked.  Hm.  But I remembered a bad experience when I'd bought a new WiFi router and set it up but forgot to unplug the old router it was replacing; the battling SSIDs on the same channel brought my network to its knees until I figured out what was happening, so I decided to try setting the Hawking's channel to a different one than the main router.  That didn't work at all, although googling revealed that others had set things up similarly with good results.  Worse, after several tries, something went sour in the Hawking, and it took some real effort over a couple of hours to restore it to a state where it wouldn't crash my network.  Eventually, after many hard-resets and more than a bit of cursing, I got it back to where I'd had it: same SSID and channel as my router.My experience underscores a perennial frustration in wireless networking: what works for my setup might not be optimal--or even work--for yours.  In my case, my router uses a late-model Atheros chipset.  Whatever is inside the Hawking seems to want to connect to my router in a particular way; with your router it might be different.  Another lesson: If it's working well, don't touch it!Setup hassles aside, the net result is a happy one: my WiFi network now extends strongly throughout my house and into my patio, where I'd previously had no connectivity at all.  Practical throughput is unimpeded, though there's usually a theoretical throughput hit for this type of repeater (not that most folks would notice, as the net WiFi speed would still far exceed even the best broadband connection's capabilities).  In my case, maybe that theoretical throughput hit is avoided by the fact that the Hawking seems to connect to my router via 802.11n whereas my computing devices utilize 802.11g?  (I say ""seems to"" because my router's client log shows a MAC address one digit different from the MAC address documented for the Hawking device in its browser-based configuration page, which shows the same MAC address for both its WAN and LAN interfaces.  I suspect this is a bug in the Hawking's browser utility; the two MAC addresses have got to differ.)My Hawking HWREN1 came running firmware 1.50, the current version per Hawking's website.  Its hardware is rev. A.Performance testing via VisualWare's superb MySpeed facility (http://myspeed.visualware.com/) shows:o  Broadband Internet throughput, both up and down, is identical to my pre-extended network's performance, even though I'm now sitting in a former dead zone.  Conclusion: the Hawking repeater imposes no bandwidth penalty for Internet usage.o  Quality of service (QOS) and latencies are also identical to before.  Conclusion: the Hawking repeater does not degrade the responsiveness or consistency that are important for Internet streaming, VOIP and gaming applications.o  I'm an Internet security nut, and the extender fully supports my WPA2 encryption and my router's dual firewalls.  It also offers MAC filtering and supports WPA Radius authentication and WPS, though I am not using these features.o  My router, the superb D-Link DIR-655 (highly, highly recommended) seems happy with the extender.o  My corporate VPN tunnels right through it with no problem.So far, only the configuration hassles keep me from giving it five stars.  I've only had it a short while, so those memories will fade, and if this device proves stable and reliable then my overall-positive estimation will only go up.  Its connectivity has already survived much microwave-oven activity in the nearby kitchen.Certainly, compared to Linksys' WRE54G competitor, the Hawking repeater is light-years better.  Another alternative would be to purchase a second access point that supports a repeater mode; D-Link has a few of these, and this would have been my first choice after giving up on the Linksys unit and the salesman convinced me to give this a try.  So far, no big regrets, and it's working well."
3661,"This is about the shipping and delivery. Great. I purchased 4 different orders that were for the camera and other accessories. All arrived either one day earlier or on day expected. Impressive considering they came from 3 different sellers. Initial look at this little jewel is impressive. I have never used such a small camcorder and was very apprehensive about purchasing it. However, the alternative was to lug my full size (albeit small) camcorder on a trip for New Years. My wife and I enjoy snorkeling and this little jewel should work just nicely. I will write again after the trip with a performance review."
3662,"We just put the new T500 through its paces during the arrival of our new baby. Both still shots and HD video taken with the camera came out beautifully. Camera performance is excellent. The touch screen controls are intuitive, the options are plenty (if you want to bother with them), and the quality of the output is great.The only reasons I'm not giving the camera at 5/5 is that the battery seems to get dragged down rather quickly (admittedly mostly due to video usage), and the included docking station is required to plug the camera into your Mac (or PC). As I travel a fair bit, and like the small size of the camera, it's a bit of a shame that a docking station is needed, in addition to the USB cable (would be optimal if you could plug straight into the camera and avoid the extra hardware).One last point to note is that this camera is the better choice if you want video and still photo capability in one. If you're looking for a camera that can store a ton of still pics on board, without requiring the not included Memory Stick Duo cards, then go with the T700 model.All in all, this is a solid camera, with a great output, in a perfect size. Definitely can't go wrong."
3663,"I am a young aspiring director, and am in the process of buying a lot of my own equipment for shooting videos to enter in film festivals. I have to tell you, what I've seen of the HG-21's sheer picture to price ratio has completely floored me. I've shot on many DV cameras that cost hundreds of dollars more than this one, but none of them can hold a candle to this camera's picture! When it came to buying my own personal camera, I'm glad I went with this one: a camera that proves size isn't everything when you're talking about quality of a camcorder.I would like to address some of the complaints I don't agree with. Firstly, battery life isn't amazing, but I wouldn't expect it to be. Almost every camera I've ever shot on has had the same battery life as this camera: about an hour and a half for the small battery and over three hours for the large battery. Don't expect to have just one battery and be able to capture everything you'd like to capture for the next few days. Get extra batteries like you should do for ANY camera you buy, and you'll be fine (and yes, splurge on the canon batteries and charger as third party batteries can possibly hurt the camera and won't tell you how long you have left to shoot with them, and being able to charge one battery while shooting on another is EXTREMELY helpful). Also, about the graininess in low light... I shot a rainstorm at night with only lightning and a streetlamp across the street lighting the scene and had almost zero graininess that I could see when replaying it on my large high def 1080p TV via an HDMI cable, and I have a very discerning eye... trust me! If you are getting graininess or artifacting in your picture, chances are you need to play with your camera settings before you go blaming the camera itself. In short, READ the manual and KNOW your camera inside and out and I guarantee you that this camera is hands down the best before you move up to the near $2000 price range.Now, I did give this camera four stars because there are a few things that annoy me about it.  At the top of the list is the STUPID mini-shoe that is not ""advanced,"" but just a reason to make you buy your shotgun and video light from cannon so it'll fit the thing. The decision to include this shoe, to me, is simply to ensure you give more money to canon and NOT to give you an ""advanced"" camera accessory. By the way, canon only offers one video light and shotgun that fit this mini-shoe and both are very overpriced in my opinion. I bought an (also very overpriced) adapter to make a universal shoe mount, and this gave me many more options. I suggest you do the same. It's better to overpay for an adapter than to overpay for a shotgun mic and video light. Oh, and don't expect to be able to use the viewfinder on this camera. It doesn't swivel and is more work that it's worth. Stick with the LCD screen and you'll be fine (though it will wear on your battery faster).Other than that, it's just little annoyances with the camera. It is small, so expect quite a bit of camera shake when you try to freehand it, even with the built in shot stabilizing tech. The camera is simply too light for shot stabilization to really be able to do its job well. My suggestion: either learn to stop your breathing and heartbeat for rock-steady hands or invest in a tripod/monopod. Honestly, it's a good idea to have at least one of these anyway, so it's not that big of a deal. Also, I don't know why this camera didn't come included with a camera strap, but it doesn't. So, go out and splurge on a $15 camera strap and get the cushiest most awesome strap you can find. Your shoulder or neck will thank you for it. Finally, if you are going to hook this camera up to your high def TV, note that the HDMI connection in the camera is a MINI-HDMI, not a full size HDMI. So, keep that in mind when buying a cable to hook the two together. Don't have an HDMI input for your TV? It's okay, the camera comes packaged with composite and component out lines so the camera can hook up to almost any TV!In short, for a young aspiring director like myself who has the want for quality but not the money for it, this is an excellent middle of the road camera. It has just enough features to make sure I don't feel stunted in what I would like to do (manual focus, auto-exposure, manual mic level adjustment, 12 hour shooting space at the highest quality picture, manual white balance, A HEADPHONE JACK - something apparently hard to find in small models like this one) as well as a rocking picture that beats every camera I've EVER shot on hands down, but is still affordable.My suggestion: BUY IT!! Read the manual to acquaint yourself with the menus (they can be a bit confusing until you master them), then just play with it to see what options work best under what conditions. I think you'll be very happy you bought this camera and took the time to master it. I love it!!"
3664,"Fairly easy setup, simple scanning and small footprint.Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the power cord is unnecessarily short.Bizarre design choice."
3665,"If you have a black computer case, have several fans and your motherboard does not do a good job controlling them, this is the solution.The panel provides connectors for 5 fans and 5 temperature probes, attached to different parts of your system by adhesive tape. If you pair probes with fans correctly, the ""auto"" mode selectively controls fans to optimize temperature.What I don't like about it: first, it beeps when you touch the screen. When you are building a silent PC, it's not such a great idea. I did not find a way to turn the beeping off. Second, you cannot set up target temperatures, so ""auto"" mode does what it does, there's no way to make it smarter. Third, it does not control PWM fans (4-pin fans) even if they provide a 3-pin connector. Last, it can set any fan to 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40% and 0%. That's right, there are no stops between 0% and 40%."
3666,This is just literally a square. It's not specific shape fitted for macs. It does the job so I can't complain.
3667,"I seem to make it a habit of trying out the cheaper end products, and for the most part I haven't been let down.  This Bluetooth dongle is no exception - it works very well despite not having any frills, but what more do you want from a Bluetooth dongle?Viewing the images and other reviews, I was a little disappointed when it first arrived.  It came in a 4""x6"" padded manila envelope and was not packaged in an off-the-shelf plastic container, but was just loose inside.  There was also no CD with software or drivers included either.  I believe these differences vary depending on which distributor you get it from, I suppose.Despite the packaging, it was in perfect working physical condition.  I was concerned about the lack of a driver disc, but luckily my computer installed generic drivers that allowed the dongle to work as it should.  I have tried it on both a Windows 7 64-bit and Ubuntu 12.04 computer, and it works great in both for me!  I should note that I was able to use the dongle in a USB 1.x port, but with intermittent problems (I had forgotten that my front-panel USB ports are 1.x).  Upon moving the dongle to a USB 2.0 port, it worked flawlessly.  The product is labeled as USB 2.0, and you should stick to using it in a USB 2.0 port.The dongle I received had a small manufacturing defect in that the rounded part that sticks out from the USB port you plug it into was affixed just slightly crooked.  If you're a stickler for aesthetics, you might be wary about this, as the manufacturer's quality control for appearance seems to be low (but what do you expect for the price point?).  Since mine is in the back of the computer, this is a non-issue for me.The USB connector portion of the dongle is slightly elongated, which makes it protrude from _flush_ USB ports slightly.  This is a good thing overall, as it can fit in _recessed_ USB ports more snugly.  The low profile of the dongle is great for crowded areas such as the back of a computer's tower.  There is also a rapidly blinking red LED that never seems to stop or indicate anything other than ""plugged in"".  I'm not sure what the point of blinking is.  When it was on the front-panel USB port of my computer, it did bother me due to being in my peripheral vision, but you might be immune to the issue, or have it mounted in a rear-facing USB port.I'll add a photo where you can see the crookedness, elongation, and LED."
3668,The software that comes with the dongle is trouble.  Caused all sorts of problems.  Use the drivers only.
3669,"Works just as advertised. It's a little slow to calculate a new route for my taste. But it works and gets me from point A to point B, so I don't complain.UPDATE: After using for over a year, it has gotten slower and slower to calculate routes. What's even worse is it is painfully slow to RE-calculate routes when I take a slight detour."
3670,"Bought the Garmin Nuvi 265WT for Christmas. Works great, except that every time I start a new trip the voice drops to a barely hearable level. I have it set to 80%. I've found I can fix this if I pause the trip, go to Volume control, do nothing but hit 'OK' then return to the map. But, if I start a second leg, say returning home, then I have to go through the same procedure to get the sound back up to where I have it set. All software and firmwear are up-to-date as of Christmas.Otherwise a nice unit, free traffic at the expense of ads but they don't intrude (I just hope it stays that way)."
3671,"Don't expect high fidelity or the ability to pull in stations from Guatemala (unless you're already there), and you'll be fine.  This is a decent, basic, rugged little radio.  I bought this one after trying 2 other fancier kinds that were short-lived, and it has served me well.  It lasted about 2 years, until I dropped it one too many times and now it won't switch back to AM.  I like to listen to my all-news AM station in my morning shower, so I'm buying another one to replace it."

Very easy to use even for people who are not technology literate."
3675,"I Received (2 Pack-3') HDMI cables fast and in good working condition. Price was great for product considering I ordered 3' cables and received 6' cables. Actually, I would have preferred the 3 foot cables I ordered for the close proximity of components which I am using these for. That is my reason for lacking 5 star rating...you may rate 10 stars for over-supplying product ordered.Also, I investigated many HDMI cables and found that the descriptions varied slightly but the images were identical. I'm not really sure if there are differences in the quality/performance of these various choices but I found the prices to be considerable different. So, I chose these for 2 reasons...First, the price was the lowest with low-cost shipping and secondly (mainly), I got 2 cables which I needed.PLEASE NOTE: It appears this product and seller often changes whereas you may not be getting exactly what I am reviewing although you are probably getting the equivalent cable quality. It seems the quantity and lengths vary making the overall cost differ slightly. I'm sure still a good value for your money.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase because of the cost savings and they work!"

3677,"I had originally written a great review and after a few more days of use, I realized the problems with these headphones.  They don't completely 100% cancel all noise.  For the most part i think just some regular ""over the ear"" headphones would have done good and sure, turning on the ""noise canceling"" feature takes your quietness into a deeper level.I have a tiny head cause i'm 5'3"" and for some reason, maybe my head is not perfectly aligned, but the cushioned headphones hurt my left ear when i've had them on for a while.  Maybe i have to break them in a little, not sure.Also, these do not cancel out people's voices nor does it cancel out the loud sound of a barista frothing the milk for your coffee.  These cancel out noise when there are many noises in the background. They do not cancel voices out either from the television.  I tried a TV on volume 50, which i must say, is SUPER loud still even though it's only half way (you know how loud these flat screens can get turned up to  and it does not cancel out the voice.  The television volume is the main reason why i needed these headphones.  They basically only work good in coffeeshops, but they'll do for now blocking out about 75% of the sound.maybe one day when i can afford to drop $100 i can get me some BOSE noise canceling ones."
3678,"A great PSU and it supplies enough power for my needs (geforce gtx 660, i7-3770S, 32gb ram, 3tb hdd, 120gb ssd, cooler master heatsink)... My only complaint is that since my PSU is mounted at the bottom of my case, all the cables are upside down.  I ended up flipping my hard drives upside down to make them plug in correctly... not too much of a concern performance wise, just a bit of a pain."
3679,"Mine died after several years of use - the network light would not illuminate and I could not connect to mine, even though the power light was on.  Since Sling uses cheap capacitors in both the power supply and the mainboard, almost all problems are due to failing capacitors.I was able to fix mine by replacing the power cord. Instead of buying a sling power cord, I found a D-Link 5 volt 3 amp adapter off ebay (model AF1805).  Has been working great ever since.I also replaced the capacitors on the mainboard as a precaution.  I think it was 3 capacitors you can get from radioshack for $1.39 a piece.  470uF 35V, radioshack model # 272-1030 .  With a screwdriver, some solder and a soldering iron, you can easily do this repair.Chance are, if your slingbox died, you can repair it."
3680,"I have been looking for a more ergonomic replacement for my Logitech MX510 for a while.  This one fit the description that the ergo experts at my office were describing and it had the reviews to back it up, so I went with it.  So far I have been pretty impressed with it, but the lack of scroll wheel has really bothered me.  In fact I bought aContour Designs ShuttleXpress, specifically for scroll functionality.On a positive note, the trackman marble is impressively comfortable.  What I like about it most is that it allows for a variety of hand positions.  For starters, It's one of very few ergonomic mice that is right or left handed in the same device.  You can also manipulate it with one finger, multiple, or the whole palm if you wanted; the buttons are large enough that you can easily find them by feel from a variety of hand positions.The lack of a scroll wheel really worried me, and those fears turned out to be warranted.  The software allows you to scroll in a similar way to normal mice by making the ball act as a scroll wheel when the mapped button is clicked.  However, this functionality does not work as well as a real scroll wheel.  At best, it is a slight inconvenience because it requires an extra click to scroll, but in practice it has many other problems.  First of all, it doesn't work at all in a variety of common programs.  When it does work, the scroll speed is too slow, even at the fastest setting, and the ball doesn't have increments, so performing tasks like selecting menu items is essentially impossible.After two weeks of trying to make due with the software scroll functionality, I decided I needed a different mouse.  I looked around and was not satisfied by any of the competition (if only the trackman marble came with a scroll wheel!).  Eventually I remembered from video editing experience that you can buy a product very similar to a scroll wheel as a stand alone peripheral called a jog wheel.  I picked one that I liked and bought it.I have to say that I have been no end of impressed with the combo so far, the Shuttle Xpress actually expands on the functionality of a standard scroll wheel and it has many programmable keys, and the trackman marble is sleek and simple to use.  I use them on opposite sides of the keyboard so they can be used simultaneously.IN SUMMATION, if you rely heavily on the scroll wheel you will probably have problems with this mouse.  If you don't, or you buy a peripheral scroll wheel like I did, this will be the best trackball you've used."
3681,"Pros:1. awesome sleek2. the best type of backlit I've seen among keyboards. Not the funky red, green, blue stuff found in Logitech and Razers. This is an elegant pure white glow.3.

3682,"For years, I have resisted the idea of buying an iPod because I thought that it was over-priced.  I figured that I would be paying a hundred dollars more over a competitor's model just to get the Apple logo on my player.  Then the price came down.  Finally I relented and bought one.  It doesn't disappoint - to a large extent.  Visually, it is an object of elegance.  It measures 2-3/8"" X 4"" X 3/8"" thick.  My unit is charcoal in color with a shiny aluminum backing. There is the 1-5/8"" X 2"" screen; below is a click wheel for navigation.  There is a hold slider and a 3.5mm mini-plug socket on top and a docking/cable socket at the bottom. I see simplicity amid functionality.  It sits in my palm comfortably and well balanced.The display in the LCD screen is bright with high definition.  The LED backlight conserves battery life, which lasts for hours. You can dock the iPod with compatible speakers or connect by a 3.5-mm mini-plug cable at the auxiliary socket.  Use the USB cable (included) for synchronization with a PC and for charging at a USB port.  An AC charger is not included.  The sound is very good with the earbuds (included) and my AC-powered tabletop iPig.  With my battery-powered Sharp i-Elegence portable player, it is another matter.  The signal output of the iPod is weak, relative to my 40-GB Creative Nomad Jukebox, which wears like iron for years and is still functioning perfectly.  To hear the music, I have to turn the volumes of both the iPod and the i-Elegence to maximum.  At these settings, the speaker crackles and buzzes.  In this respect, I was disappointed.  I never had this problem before with the Nomad.  This iPod classic employs a mini-hard drive.  It is best to keep it still on desktops.  It will tolerate minimal activities like walking or riding in a car.  But it is not for joggers who intend to bring their players along.  The large capacity at 160 GB means room for your entire music library.  You can use this iPod for videos too, but I use mine mainly for audio.  A mp3 track management software called iTune comes with the purchase, which you download at the Apple website.  I have nothing but praise for this software.  It is rock-solid.  It crashed only once in over a month.  The tracks are arranged in the same order as the CD's, unlike those in the Nomad software, which are in alphabetical order.  It synchronizes with the iPod seamlessly.  Any update made in iTune gets transferred to the iPod during synchronization. This is not so in Songbird, the software for the Philips GoGear.  In conclusion, this iPod Classic 7G is an appealing and capable player.  Had it not been for the weak output, I would have given it a 5-star."
3683,"I ordered two of them to use between my tablet and my camera so I can quickly upload photos. The description had no indication of whether or not it came with a full size adapter, therefore I went out and bought one.

No worries, since when I take my MacBook with me I usually need a bigger bag anyhow.Plenty of nice size compartments inside for files, business cards, and the aforementioned electronic accessories that I find as must haves for the short trip. Though I haven't used this case for long, I have few doubts of its durability as I've purchased other Caselogic laptop bags in the past and they seem to hold up quite well.For the price, well worth it for a fabric case (I'm not much for the premium price of leather.)"

First of all, I love the size, I couldn't believe how small and light it was.  The capacity was great for what I wanted it for, I plan to just put the music on that I listen to most of the time and use the other ipod for everything else.  I found the click wheel to be responsive, I noticed that others had complained about that.  Now, I do have the bose speakers and JBL on stage.  The nano will play but not charge.  I looked on apple's website and it says that the nano is compatible with the JBL on stage II and III and the bose speaker II.  It doesn't tell you which ones will also charge the nano, I don't know how they are determining whether its compatible, will it just play it or play it and charge it?  I couldn't find that information.  Overall though I would recommend the nano."

3692,"This is absolutely the most fascinating ipod I've had so far....but the only complaint I have is that the ipod battery wastes so fast. I suggest dimming the backlight, not playing with the games or surfing the internet for long periods of time because it wears the battery as well.One little side note if you do surf the web it is hard to read any of the web pages which is kind of discouraging but you can see some things for the most part. And if you have any adapters, boomboxs or ipod docks you may have to invest in new ones because the itouch isnt compatible with much of any of the older ipod stuff and you have to download itunes 8.1 in order to download music aside from that it is fun and you'll love all of the little knick knacks that come with it."

But, I didn't realize that the camera on the Touch is FAAAAAR inferior to the camera on the new iPhone. They ARE NOT the same. I still would have purchased this... because, let's face it... they're the best on the market. But, I wish I'd known that the camera is just okay as compared to the iPhone camera, which is downright great."
3695,"They worked.  They never crashed.  Would have been nice to have had some sort of mark on them so you could tell them apart ... nothing fancy, just a letter or number stamped on it or a white strip where you could write on them with a felt-tipped marker.  Basically, I have to plug them in to see which one has my documents, which one has my financial records, and which one has my home inventory.  Otherwise, they have proven very reliable over the years and have suffered through much abuse."
3696,"It appears the bad economy is hitting drive makers, because it is easy to find this drive at less than half the suggested retail price including here on Company A.  It works great, however like all drives the stated size is roughly 10-15% higher than the actual formatted and usable space;  1.36 TB is the available space.  The LED is very bright as others have mentioned but if you are not sleeping in the same room as the drive, it is not an issue.  The Free Agent drive works without problem with TimeMachine as advertised and should give nearly a year of back-ups with the new 320 GB drives found on MacBooks and MacBook Pros.  The enclosure is small for a 3.5 inch drive and it is roughly 25-30% smaller than Maxtor One-Touch enclosures. Not quite portable, but it would travel in a back-pack with your laptop if you were not concerned about the weight.  The product details do not indicate it, but the drive comes with  three cables:  USB 2.0 full size to mini, FireWire 800 to 400 and FireWire 800 to 800.  This in itself would be about $25.00 in cables if you had to buy them as you do with many other drives.  The two FireWire 800 ports make it real easy to daisy chain with an existing FireWire drive, you can go from Apple's new default of FireWire 800 to this drive to your existing FireWire 400 equipment like another drive of video camera."
3697,"So I will start off by saying that I do really appreciate my Invisible Shield.  It does just what it says - I don't have a single scratch anywhere on my iPod touch, and I'm forever tossing it into my purse with keys, change, and all sorts of other miscellaneous things.  I didn't notice a change in sensitivity or anything, and it's really great.  I liked this product so much that this particular purchase was actually my second one.That being said, I had a somewhat difficult time getting the corners of the backside protector to stay, and over the last 5 months have actually ended up trimming the corners off because they were a catch-all for dirt.  I have also just removed the front screen protector.  After putting a case on my iPod, it seemed to develop a bubble that I just couldn't get out.  I dealt with it for a couple of months hoping it would just dissipate, but it didn't.  It wasn't just a physical aberration; it was quite visible as well.  I am still contemplating whether or not to order another front screen protector.  It's worth noting that I've left the back protector on, which hasn't given me any troubles after I trimmed the corners off."
3698,"When I received the router, I went through and configured everything then nearly tore my hair out trying to figure out why it wasn't working.  CradlePoint's web site going down for several hours while I was working on it didn't help.  It turned out the router that was shipped to me had an older firmware version, one that was incompatible with my cellular modem.  When CradlePoint's web site came back up, I downloaded the latest firmware, which fixed the problem, but also wiped out the configuration, forcing me to start over from scratch.Anyone who buys this router should check to see if they have the most recent firmware BEFORE they start to set things up."
3699,"I just wanted a dual-core laptop in this size and price range and opted for this with its Intel T series processor.  The newerP seriesuses less power but costs more.  Shop around!  I saw differences of $300 in price for this exact same computer.There are too many considerations about a computer to cover in 300 words. I won't repeat specs you can see in the description.While deciding whether to install my favorite Linux or Windows XP, I gave the 64-bit Vista Home Premium a shot and ended up keeping that.  I found compatible drivers and software for everything I run:  OpenOffice (a free alternative to MS Office), Canon camera software, TextPad & Vim, PGP, and SilverFast SE (slide and film digitizer), IrfanView (a free photo editor), and iTunes.  Everything runs great except that IE 7 occasionally locks up on Hotmail or MSN (ironically, both Microsoft sites).STRENGTHS:* I don't like touch pads and prefer a mouse, but this touch pad is great (for a touch pad).* Boot-up, from cold to password prompt, is only 55 seconds.* Good sound, great display, and it's loaded with ports, connectors, web cam, etc.* Good keyboard action. I have large hands and type like a fiend, and I can really go to town on this.* It did not come loaded with ""craplets,"" so I spent very little time cleaning those off.* Even the trial copy of Norton seems to work.LIMITATIONS:* The keys are a sort of light metallic-beige color with small white printing, which makes them impossible to read in low light.  It was a pain until I memorized the locations of the home, del & end keys, etc.* Vista took some getting used to, because Microsoft rearranged things. I wouldn't take Vista Pro if you gave it to me because Vista Home Premium is already loaded with bells & whistles.  (The automatic updates have been great!)* It's heavy. I intended to take this along on an international trip, but my dread grew as the trip approached and I boughtthis netbookfor travel instead, and I am glad I did.* On battery, mine runs just over two hours (2:12) on the ""HP Recommended"" power plan; there are other choices.  A depleted battery takes about 90 minutes to fully re-charge while the computer's in use."
3700,"Ken Parks, a professional wedding photographer reports, ""This is not the best, but it does the job.  There is the OEM that is weather-proof.  And this unit is not weather-proof."""
3701,What can you say about a step up ring? It works fine for my 49mm filter on a 46mm lens.
3702,"I've bought many cheap versions on Ebay in the past and I finally decided to buy a whole set to cover all my bases. The difference in quality is very minimal between Fotodiox and those from overseas - about the only difference being the better quality white lettering on the rim. The threads are not buttery smooth but its acceptable for occassional use.Most people buy these step-up rings when they have multiple lenses of different thread diameters and they want to use a large filter to attach to all their lenses. You can use any sequential combination of step-up rings together to get to the desired filter size. The problem with that is when the position of the filter is too far away from the lens (ex: attaching many rings to accomodate 52mm to 77mm), you can run into the problem of severe vignetting if the lens' focal length is wide enough. For example, my 35mm prime lens using 52-55-58-62-67-72 rings with a 72mm filter will get very dark corners in the pictures. Another possible issue is when using a macro lens and the filter is again positioned away from the lens. In this case, there's greater chance of dust particles/imperfections on the filter that can affect your pictures. Another issue to keep in mind is that when using these step-up rings, your original lens cap will no longer fit on the filter, which is now oversized, and unfortunately, any lens hood that you had will no longer be able to detach/attach with a oversized filter blocking the way.With those caveats out of the way, these step-up do their job just fine, hence the 4-star rating. Ideally, step-up rings should be avoided altogther because there is no real advantage to them apart from ecomonical savings. But if it comes down to it, at the most I would use 2 to 3 rings together as my recommendation. Hope this helps."
3703,"I currently own the original Canon 5D.  It is a wonderful camera that produces velvety images that are very sharp with accurate color rendition.  I was hoping that the 5D Mark II would produce the same quality images, and I would be able to make much larger prints.  The improvements made to the Mark II are very nice.  I particularly like the additional information shown in the view screen.  More options for how the controls operate are also nice.  Expanded ISO is good.  I doubt I would use the video, but it's a nice feature.  My first surprise was that the image on the LCD was quite dark.  I thought the camera was underexposing until I found I could adjust the brightness of the LCD.  That helped, but I was never able to get what I thought was an accurate view of my image.  So the large, bright  LCD was good for gross level reference only.  Perhaps that's good enough, but why bother with making it larger and brighter if you must wait to see an accurate image in Lightroom?  I did not see any improvement with focus speed or accuracy.  I did many 1 - 1 comparisons with my 5D - same lens, same exposure, ISO, same everything.  While the images were often close, I believe the Mark II has a bit softer focus and bit more contrast.  I was not able to ""dial in"" the same smooth gradient of color as with the 5D, and with sharpening, the Mark II appeared more crunchy - more digital.  Does the  5D Mark II make excellent images?  Absolutely.  Is there a learning curve with every new advanced camera?  Of course. Could I eventually adapt a new workflow to get the same quality images as I get with my original 5D?  Perhaps.  Can I get high quality, large prints from my original 5D?  Yes.  For me the Mark II did not have significantly better image quality than my 5D; in fact, I thought the quality was not as good.  The new features are nice, but not worth $2,000. I returned the 5D Mark II."
3704,"This camera takes beautiful pictures in daylight, but once you go above about 400 iso, the pictures get noisy. I expected this with a point & shoot, but didn't expect the noise to be as bad as it is at higher isos. 14.7 megapixels is overkill. I wish it was more like 8-10 megapixels, due to the noise situation. Again, though, I should have expected this before I bought the camera.Pros:Great manual controlVery easily accessable controlsBuilt like a tankHotshoe on topExcellent battery lifeCons:As I mentioned, noisy in lower light conditions"
3705,I like the Hoya brand filter- the promasters that my local camera shop carries tend to stick on my lens for some reason- the last time it was stuck so good I had to take a dremel to it to get it off. The Hoya doesn't seem to get stuck as easily. It is also good quality glass and the glass doesn't rattle like the promaster ones do.  I use this just as a protective layer between my actual lens and the world- it was a bit pricey but worth laying down a little extra on quality.
3706,"I love me some nice bokeh.  Round, smooth balls of magical light in my backgrounds makes me happy.  No hard edges, onion rings, corners.  This lens does not produce as beautiful bokeh as the Sigma 50/1.4 and surprisingly the Nikon 50/1.8g.  You lose a bit of low light capability with the 1.8g, but the bokeh is markedly better, as is the price, and the image quality is great.  If bokeh matters to you, check out this comparison: [...]You might find yourself surprised by what lens you end up wanting to buy."
3707,"This is a nice basic case for the I-Touch.  My husband actually wanted one for his I-Phone, the I-Phone is a little too large for this case.  My only complaint is I paid $20.00 and now I see Company A has reduced the price to $12.99!"
3708,"I have owned this for six months and the sound is pretty decent in my office room.  I own a 32 GB iPod Touch Gen 2 and can dock it without even taking it out of its DLO Hip Case (the best case, by the way).  The speaker is in the back, and has good volume.  I like the remote control, small and effective.  Sony sells a version of this that does not have a CD player, and I saw it at store, it's quite a bit smaller than this one and seems to have same features and is $20 cheaper, so one might consider that if CDs are not important to you.  All in all, I have owned a couple other units for my Ipod, make by I-Home and a couple other no name brnads, and this one excels.  Sony is very strong.  Buy."
3709,"I own two of these and they both work well.  I like the two hot outlets, and the rest controlled by the switch.  Twice so far I have had problems where the switch won't turn on/off the surge protector for a couple of months.  Then it mysteriously starts working again.  There is a button on the surge protector itself but that is hard to reach when it is behind the tv stand.  Overall I am very happy with this though and would buy more in the future."
3710,"This device works well on close up portraits I encounter on the job. The problem is you look like a fool blowing up this odd looking thing prior to taking your shot. If you can get past this, you can make this goofy thing work well for you."
3711,"Strong, easy to install, and equipped to handle a wide range of displays.I hung my 32&#34; Vizio with this unit.Pros:Comes with a cheap bubble-level, which is a very handy installation tool if you don't already have one.Comes with a decent HDMI cable, which is the part I always forget to pick up :)Cons:Holes for the VESA mount screws are too big for the screws ... almost big enough for the heads of the screws to slip through.  Needed washers for a safe mount, and the size washers required weren't provided for the size screws I needed.  The correct screws were provided, and washers were provided for some other size of screws which were also provided, just not for the size I had to use.  Not a big deal ... I just had to find some appropriate washers.Where adjustments could be tightened down requires a hex key (allen wrench) ... some folks expect to see a thumb knob. (again, not a big deal, just keep a hex key handy.I didn't care for the bright blue paw print logo on the mount, but that was fully disclosed in the product photo.My first inclination was to rate this item 3 stars, but in hindsight, most of my &#34;Cons&#34; were fully apparent in the product description and photo ... if the logo and lack of thumb knob (tool-less) adjustment aren't of concern for you, and you have some assorted washers handy, this is an excellent mount, and an excellent value.It's worth noting that I bought this &#34;same&#34; mount (same ASIN) a year or two ago, and what was delivered this time bore substantial improvements over the later model."
3712,"This mount was very simple to install.  The level that comes with the mount was an added bonus.  The instructions could be better, but then again, there is not much to it.  I mounted a 32"" lcd tv with this mount.  The mount is small enough that it is hidden behind the TV."
3713,"I just received these 20 minutes ago and they are the best phones yet. Very even sound from highs to lows, detailed and clean. Sound stage is huge and precise instrument location perfect! Songs that have been recorded what I thought was badly are very good now. I am hearing things that just  were not there or where there but masked by some type of distortion. Voices are very natural and not shrill at all. Spyro gyro sounds even better! I play Bass Guitar so I can tell if it is recreated accurately or not and it is. I have 22 sets of earplugs. Everything from Bose, Sony, Koss, Apple both kinds, and many more. these are as close to high end home speakers as I have heard before. Well worth the price! Oh yeah, to tell right from left, the altec words are on the outside of the phone. So there correct if you cant see the writing. The clothes cords are very Quiet and even more so if you put the over the ears. Very addicting to listen to."
3714,Good camera for the money.  Had it for a few months now without problems.  You do need a very good computer to do any meaningful editing in HD though - at least core2 quad processor.
3715,"Using this camera outdoors I am satisfied. It fits easily in my purse or my husband's backpack. We've used it for outdoor family events and to record mountain biking. For how small and inexpensive it is it does great. The battery life is great too.Let me preface by saying I am a professional photographer so I may be a little too picky, but I am not satisfied with indoor recording at all. We are going to have another baby and I am searching for another camera because this won't cut it for recording the baby's birth. The indoor recording is VERY noisy. I've read that pretty much all flip cameras have this problem though so I guess a potential buyer should just know to expect noisy indoor pics."
3716,I have bought a couple of these now. They are simple to assemble and quickly installed. They hold my GPS device nicely where it is most convenient. No sticky backing that is difficult to remove from car interiors and can be easily taken out to use in another car or truck.
3717,"I have anAllen Sports Navigator Mobile Phone Software and Bluetooth GPS Devicethat works through your cell phone, but my phone screen is very small.  When I received the `Tom Tom ONE 125', I was amazed at how easy it was to setup and use.  I had once visited a friend 65 miles away and it took me almost two hours, due to not being familiar with the area.  With the Tom Tom, I was there in one hour.  Even when I took the wrong highway (on purpose), the Tom Tom recalculated my route with the same destination.The Tom Tom is all touch/tap controlled on the screen.  The driving view is in a nice perspective or plan view (2D) giving you plenty of warning both verbally (you can pick from eleven English voices and several other languages) and visually (large crisp screen).  Some of the great features are its easy Tap to zoom in/out, showing you your current location, names of roads you are on and near, trip time, remaining distance and arrival time.  The GPS signal strength is strong.  Only once did it get lost through a tunnel and it recalculated itself within a minute.To navigate an upcoming trip, just tap the intuitive screen and select ""Navigate to..."".  You can enter an address with a small keyboard (i.e., street, house number, town).  You're done.Some cool features:*Shows current time*Navigate to any address*Add any address or location (ATM, restaurant, gas station, etc.) to Favorites*`Help Me' feature that  addresses `phone for help', `drive to help', `walk to help', `where am I?', `First Aid Guide'.Change preferences allow you to:*Use night colors*Show your Points of Interest (POI) on a map and warns you when you are near one*Guided Tours of Tom Tom*Safety preferences (seven items you choose like, `warn not to leave device in car', `warn when driving faster than speed limit', `suggest driving breaks', etc.*Turn sound On or Off with a Volume control*Display the status bar horizontally or vertically*Can be set to specific units, clock, keyboard, car symbol, brightness, map colors, left-handed option, language (other than English) and moreThe only thing I did not like was the fact that you can only update maps for FREE the first 30 days after purchase.  However, this version of the Tom Tom is simply easy to use (I could learn to use the functions before I read the manual).  The voice and map (a perfect 3.5 inch screen) are a solid reassurance that you are headed in the right direction.  In fact, it guided me to my own driveway parking spot and my parking stall at work.  I would recommend updating maps with its easy USB port every six months or so, like all other GPS devices (the `Allen Navigator GPS' is the only self-updating GPS on the market).  I highly suggest reading the manufacturer's list of functions here on Company A to get a FULL picture of what this great GPS device provides.  This is only a snapshot, but I am very happy with this unit.Caution:  California does not allow windshield mounted devices for safety, and the adhesive mounting pad is a pain to get off.  I'd suggest getting a weight mounted dashboard holder.  Also, never try to use your Tom Tom while driving - pull over safely."
3718,The case fit my computer perfectly. It does exactly what it is meant to do and that is protect my Mac.
3719,"""Hi-definition audio from amazingly small speakers"" - I think the photos try to make this speaker set look bigger than it is. I think the small size is a plus. If you are looking for a 2.0 (meaning no sub-woofer) speaker set that will sit next to a monitor or provide amplified sound for an Mp3 /4 player, then this set would be a good choice.Physically, these speakers are so small that most people could easily cover the front of either of these speakers with their hand. There is only one knob - the on/off volume control, which is on the right side speaker (sorry lefties). There is a port on the top of each one of these to help the bass come out - they can move a good bit of air. You can change the look of the front of these as they have a black acoustic mesh cover that can be removed to reveal a silvery metallic front panel that is finish quality. I like the laptop style transformer `brick' instead of a `wall wart'. It is probably a more expensive configuration, but can really be a help when trying to get everything plugged into one power strip or UPS. This brick has an indicator LED so you can tell that it is energized. I also like the solid feel and rubber, full bottom pad of each speaker. The speakers are also slanted so that they direct sound more at your ears and not your elbows. Another feature I really like is that this set seems to be well shielded - something that Creative might want to pay a little more marketing attention to. This helps this set to keep out radio interference (which more and more homes and workplaces have to deal with) from wi-fi, bluetooth, cell phones, cordless phones, and radio transceivers; and preserve the audio quality. I was not able to test the ipod docking station feature as I do not have one and that requires an optional cable I do not have, anyway.This set worked very well to provide clear, room filling sound with any device I have and with any EQ setting. It is usable with a computer or a portable Mp3 player at your home or your office -- it is not designed to be portable. I would not use it while traveling; there are better choices for that purpose. One big drawback to me is the price when I reviewed it was $150 (otherwise it would be five-star) -- I think this set would be a better value if the price were 25 to 50% less, and they might sell a million of 'em..."
3720,"I got this because I use both Mac and Windows operating systems and this device claims to be usable by both.  Upon receiving it, I plugged it in with Mac OSX and it appeared as expected, then I formatted it to FAT32 so it could be read by both platforms.  I put a bunch of files on it with Mac and it worked great and very fast with the Firewire 800 so I was nothing but pleased at this point.  But I tried to use it with my XP laptop and it wouldn't show the drive.  So I even used my Mac Mini with boot camp XP and still nothing.  I've been updating my Windows service pack, troubleshooting in every way possible, but still nothing.  I have a WD exHDD that has its own plug and that one works fine, so my only conclusion is that while running in XP the USB bus isn't supplying enough power for this portable drive.  But there is no place on it for a power adaptor as it was intended only to be USB powered.  So if Windows systems don't provide enough power through USB and this device can only operate through USB power, then why does the description say it works with Windows?Basically, if you are only using Mac OS, then this is a great find and you won't be disappointed.  But watch out if you are intending on using it with Windows, in spite of what the description claims.-Further details: So when I plug it into a computer running XP, it makes the USB sound as expected, the hard drive starts spinning, the OS installs the driver, it gives me the ""device has been installed and is ready to use"" message, but I can't access it.  I tried another portable hard drive of a different brand and it does the exact same thing on two separate computers running XP.  This is obviously a consistent unavoidable problem that will occur on every XP system, and hard drives intended for Mac should not be advertised as Windows compatible because they are not."
3721,This is the second outdoor camera I have bought from Company A in this price range. I accidentally shorted the first one out while messing in the power box. The cameras work well for the price but are definately less quality than my initial cameras but my initial cameras for my security system cost a lot more. Usually you get what you pay for but i'm tired of paying crazy amounts of money to get just a bit more quality. These cameras should last long enough and are cheap enough to replace when necessary.
3722,"As our media libraries grow, we need bigger drives. It's just that simple. I decided to pick up one of the WD Green drives, and formatted it without an issue. It's not the fastest of drives (I'm using it in an external USB enclosure) but it does what I need it to do: store a lot of data without (hopefully) failing.The only thing that sucks and dings a star from this is the warranty. Most drives are coming with 5 year warranties, and this only had a 3 year warranty. Granted, if the drive goes south, I'll be more upset about the data loss than the drive. WD, in my experience, has been awesome about returning faulty drives and getting replacement ones to me in a timely manner."
3723,"Light Weight Construction however it has worked on 7 of the 10 drives that I have had in it so far.I'm Happy with it anyway.BTW the Drives that it didn't read were 2 White box 3.5"" and a 2.5"" out of a Gateway Laptop."
3724,"Pros:- This pair of speakers sound beautiful...gorgeous! It produces a roomful of sound in the living room and sound fantastic in the bedroom at very low volume level. Just recently, speaker manufacturers are incorporating subwoofers in these smaller packages. The subwoofer makes a huge difference.- Powerful, voluminous sound considering its size and small footprint.- Sleek, shiny, nerdy, cool, looks great. It can be a conversation piece.- Easy access on/off switch and volume control.- Easy setup- With an extra auxiliary input.Cons:- There is no knob or button to adjust the subwoofer level. The speaker are a bit bass heavy.- No remote control. It would be nice to have one, since most MP3 players don't have it's own remote if you are slumped on a couch.- The down firing subwoofers would benefit greatly with a protective metal grill. You might accidentally damage the paper by holding the speakers from the bottom.Great match for your desktop PC's, notebooks and MP3 players. This is not an ipod dock; but the input will work with all kinds of MP3 players. Also excellent as a stereo speakers for a mini home theater setup in a dorm or a small bedroom. The two speakers are permanently connected with a thick cable. It comes with an AC adapter and 6 ft length audio cable. One good addition is a cable splitter to work with a red and white RCA source."
3725,"I purchased two of these thumbdrives and they work great.  They are small and allow for other USB devices to be connected without causing space issues.They disconnect easily.  Overall, I am pleased. Kingston makes great product that can be counted on time and time again."
3726,"This is a great speaker system for the ipod. I love the clarity of the sound, although the volume doesn't go that loud. I used the speakers for about 3 weeks and then I used it in the bathroom while I was taking a shower (away from any water of course). After the shower, the dock was no longer recognizing the connection to the ipod. I have used portable ipod speakers while I was in the shower before and never had an issue (logitech mm50). I called Altec Lansing customer service and they told me they could replace the speakers but I would have to pay for the shipping of my current speaker to them and they would cover return shipping. It was my only option, so I payed $17 for the shipping and received the replacement speakers 6 weeks later. It was really inconvenient. I haven't even tried the new ones in the shower because I do not want them to break again.Other than that, they are pretty awesome speakers."
3727,"I was tempted by the little $20 version, but opted for a couple pairs of these, since the reviewers felt the little ones were more in the toy category.  I'm happy I upgraded.  They have a nice feel, with decent glass optics.  They do float, albeit not like a cork, but that's because they seem to be made of reasonably sturdy materials.  The strap is pretty thin, but while it may not be particularly comfy, it seems sturdy, and that's all I can really ask.I did end up returning one set of these for replacement because the left side fogged up.  I noticed the soft rubber around the eyepieces was hard and cracking, so I wondered if these were stored in a high heat, which may have compromised the seals.  The replacement set was perfect, so I exchanged the second set as well, since it also had the cracking around the eyepiece rubber.  I'm guessing/hoping the failure of the first set was related to what I believe was a distribution/storage issue, rather than a manufacturing or design defect."
3728,"This is a nice case, sturdy, but it doesn't hold up to being dropped on a hard floor.  My baby dropped it on the bathroom floor and the case flew off and broke.  I was able to put it back on, but it's broken.  Since it's suppose to protect the ipod I'm not sure I'd trust it if you need it to be rugged.  However with normal use, it's great.  It feels very nice and it snaps shut very tightly."
3729,"I bought this hard drive to attach to my Dish receiver.  Using it over a month now and have had no problems.  It's small, quiet and fast.  My only complaint is that it runs very hot when used for long periods of time.  Make sure you have a lot of ventilation around the drive.  Definitely recommend."
3730,"Used with my Edmiax AC600 Wireless adapter - Windows reports that the device would be faster if plugged into a proper USB3.0 port, despite being plugged IN TO a USB3.0 port.  But the adapter speeds are right.  Weird error, hence the 1 star deduction, but since it works...."
3731,"Its a simple piece of kit that is priced pretty expensively but if you are plugging in a pretty expensive camera you have to ensure it is safe right? well, I wish it were cheaper because it seems like a crazy price for an adapter. I'm dropping a star for the rating because of the price but otherwise it just works..."
3732,"I purchased this bag for my new Samsung NC-10 netbook as I was planning on taking it to Europe when I go on vacation. I read existing reviews and saw that it was generally well received by people who purchased it. I will admit I was drawn to a similar bag from Targus but read of that bags lack of padding necessary to protect the computer for traveling. So that was a deal-breaker for me and made up my mind for the Solo case. And I am happy to say it was a good decision.I feel the quality and construction of the case is top-notch. The material appears to be durable, yet business-like. The locking clasp in the front is nothing special and is similar to that of many camera bags (how durable the part is waits to be seen). When opened, the clasp allows the case flap to open and expose the interior of the case. The back pocket is for storing the netbook (and in the case of the NC-10, its slip case as well) without allowing it to slide around inside. Inside padding is somewhat thin but is bolstered by extremely stiff walls which bolster the sides of the case. I think this provides an adequate level of protection for the netbook as long as you do not take unnecessary risks with it. The next pocket allows for storage of items inside two smaller cubby-pockets inside the larger one. The last pocket is available for stowing such items as the power cords and adapter. And the case also comes with a decent shoulder strap that is padded and attaches to two steel rings secured nicely to the case.One feature I have yet to use is the case's ability to help speed you through airport security. This is what Solo refers to as ""Check Fast"" and allows you to open the clasp on the front of the bag, then release a Velcro-secured strap along the bottom of the case which allows the case to separate and lie flat for airport security scanning. Supposedly this negates the need to open the bag and empty the contents for TSA people (ruins their ability to inconvenience you further). I hope the bag works as advertised. When the case is open you also have access to a zippered storage pouch. I think this is a great place to store the case's shoulder strap when it is not in use.So all in all I am quite happy with my purchase of this case. Be warned that it adds a couple of pounds to the weight of your netbook. I like it as I can carry my netbook, the power cords, and a wireless mouse (and still have room for a few other items. Also, as another reviewer points out, the more you place in the bag the more it tends to bulge outward. This has the adverse effect of causing the padded carry handle to recede into the case flap. I am unsure if this will stretch out with continued use. It is a little annoying but is not a deal-breaker in my opinion. The only other thing I wish Solo had done was make the pockets more expandable (like an accordion file)as they seem to stay narrow at the bottom as the top of the pockets open.I would recommend this case to anyone you likes having all necessary accessories with them in a relatively compact bag."
3733,I had some issues getting it to program and had to call their customer service people. They were very helpful and got it up and running for me. It isn't the most intuitive remote to use but it does work well. The most useful feature for me was the ability to &#34;learn&#34; from your current remote.
3734,"Adapter works adequately, but pictures won't be suitable for National Geographic.  I had stalled for a long time on getting an FD -> EOS adapter and am glad I ordered the Opteka.  I have a whole case of elderly FD lenses with great optics that hadn't been used since I ""went digital.""  The adapter fits these lenses securely to my Rebel body and does provide focusing to infinity (which not all adapters do).  The Opteka optics are adequate but not comparable to Canon FD -- after all, they are introducing some additional glass.  The Opteka is a slight teleconverter (1.25x) which coupled with the 1.6 factor for the smaller sensor in most of Canon's DSLRs gives a 2x magnification compared to the field of view of the FD lenses on a 35mm body.  With this adapter, my FD 200mm lens has the image equivalent of a 400mm lens on a 35mm or full-size sensor DSLR.  While the adapter makes no sense to use with my FD 24mm (which would become a ""slow"" normal lens), it is quite reasonable to use with the old telephoto lenses.  Like any teleconverter, a tradeoff is the loss of an f-stop -- which is not a big deal with the FD 100mm f/2.8 or the FD 200mm f/4 -- but with this adapter everything pretty much needs a tripod.  Manual focus is no big deal when using a tripod mounted tele lens, but I did discover that I needed to adjust the auto exposure settings; the Rebel's meter didn't accurately read for the 1-f/stop loss. once I realized that, changing the under/over setting solved any exposure issues. All in all, this adapter is not going to keep you from investing in some good EOS lenses but will let you get some mileage out of those trusty old FD lenses in special circumstances. I haven't pulled out the optics to use as a macro tube yet, but I like having that option with the Opteka."
3735,"The Zeikos 3 Piece Filter Kit includes a Ultra Violet (UV), Circular Polarizer (CPL), a Fluorescent (FLD) Filter, and a small protective ""pleather"" carrying case.The filters are fairly good quality and do not effect the normal performance of myCanon VIXIA HV40 HD HDV Camcorder with 10x Optical Zoom. I keep the UV Filter installed on the camera to protect the lens at all times. Since the filters are threaded, you can ""stack"" multiple filters onto your camera.This is a good set at a reasonable price. Recommended!"
3736,"Like other reviewers have said this thing is really big. However there's plenty of room in my Corsair Graphite 600 case. Unlike others, I found the installation to be fairly easy. Didn't need extra hands to replace the CPU fan that come with my AMD CPU. I found that it does block one memory slot on my Corsair Formula-Z board. This may be due to the memory that I'm using. There is a definite difference in the temperatures  in my system. Haven't  had chance to compare yet, but so far very happy"
3737,"I bought this on sale at Target for $220 a month ago. Originally I was going to use it as a main TV in my living room as a first HDTV, but it was a bit small and I ended up buying a 32"" Sony for that soon after. So, being stuck with 2 TV's, I decided to put this one in the bedroom. I tried it on my computer with the comp cable and was blown away by it, so it's now my new monitor, and the bedroom now has cable after running a drop in from a splitter in the basement. The pic on TV wasn't perfect with the presets, but after a few minutes of adjustments it looks great to me. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is the slightly tinny sound, but I can live with that as a second TV."
3738,"After looking over Best Buy's in-store selection of cases, I chose this one -- and I'm still quite happy with the purchase. It looks really sharp over the ipod touch's silver back (the case is slightly transparent), is easy enough to get on and off (when I switch to an armband case for exercise), and seems pretty durable. I think the only downside is that it's just a bit too large to fit inside DLO's armband case --- otherwise, it would be a perfect combo.A friend of mine has her iPhone in a regular hard plastic case, and the thing snapped at the hinges only a week after having it, due to her taking the phone out to put in an armband case. The material for this case is tough enough not to bend all over the place, but pliant enough to get the iPod out easily and quickly if need be."
3739,great filter I use it on my lens to protect the front lens element.....so there isn't much to say...I put it on and forgot about it......that makes it great!!!!
3740,"I was concerned that this camera didn't have an optical zoom or stabilization.  My workarounds are to think of it as a still camera with a live view screen & audio.  I record several very short segments almost every day as a sort of video diary.  I make a ""click"" to show when the camera is still enough to do a screen capture for a still image.  And I move the camera very close to the subject (subject is out of focus but still quite viewable even at a few inches) to give direction, then pull back to get it in good focus.The rubber protector is ugly but does the job.Super easy to use, turn on from side switch, press on, the off.  I'm using it a lot more than I expected because it is always at hand.If left connected to the USB cable the battery gets SUPER hot, so be sure to unplug when the full light comes on."
3741,"Installation was straightforward. It was hard labor to tighten those screws without using power tools as they recommend.It holds my new 55"" TV very well. It even goes nicely with wall mount cable kit I bought. the base mount board hole was exact fit.5 stars for the product.The bonus cable came with it is a joke. probably broken line in the middle or cheap quality control. Just don't include that kinda poor one or put in a good one.-1 star for that!"
3742,it has worked well for me... I have a MBP retina display and added another sleeve to take up the extra space. I think is it well made and have not had any issues yet
3743,"I purchased this monitor to be my 3rd monitor in a three monitor racing setup.  I also use it for my Windows desktop and it does a very good job.  I am somewhat spoiled though because my main center monitor is a 27"" Midnight that cost me over a grand and is a beautifully rich-colored panel.  It's literally the best monitor I've ever seen in every respect.  Rather than stating what my Midnight has, I'll list what the Asus does not have:- no USB hub- no memory card readers- viewing angle is ok, but not great - especially in the vertical direction- colors are not quite as vibrant and deep as other monitors- no 16:10 aspect ratio - only 16:9Even with the above gripes, I can't complain because the price is right for what you get (about $200 at the time I purchased it in November of 2010).  I don't expect a lot of extras or super high picture quality for a monitor at this price.  The monitor does have a button for selecting preset video settings like ""theater"" and ""gaming"" etc. which essentially changes brightness, contrast and color settings.  I found none of them to be perfect for me, but only because I was trying to match its look to my other two monitors.  I used the relatively easy on screen display to make some color and brightness adjustments and it almost matches my other monitors now.  If I was using this monitor as my primary single monitor, I would be disappointed.  It's only because I'm using it right beside my existing $1000+ Midnight monitor that it looks a little sub-par, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.In summary, I'm glad I bought it, and I would buy it again if I ever need to replace my left side monitor.  One other thing to note: if you are thinking about buying this for a three monitor setup, the side bezels are fairly thin (which is a good thing).  The side bezels are thinner than either of my other monitors which makes it an ideal choice for a three monitor racing or gaming setup.EDIT as of 7/9/2011:I just purchased 2 more of these monitors and they work just as well as the first one.  I wanted to set up an Eyefinity system with three identical monitors and the two additional ones compliment the first one very well.  The two newer ones seem to have different default contrast and brightness settings out of the box, but I made some simple adjustments using the built-in on-screen menus and now all three look identical.  Great monitors for the price.  I still miss my Midnight IPS panel, but these are still great looking for a TN panel and worth it in order to get Eyefinity gaming!"
3744,"i use this on my keyboard while my MBP is next to the 24"" LED monitor. along with a Logitech mouse, it's pretty much an extension of my laptop's keyboard with all its function keys. i especially like doing the budget because of the number pad. also, i like some of the quick-launch buttons for iTunes, Safari, etc., which can be customized. it's sleek, low profile matches the gloss of the LED monitor. its keys are soft and silent with quicker, shorter throws than my MBP. battery life is extraordinarily long, too, with its auto standby ability."
3745,"I bought it for the IR dongle to use with my Harmony remote and for that it works great.  The remote that comes with it is about what I would expect for something this cheap.  It works, but could be better.  The main thing I noticed in the little bit I used the included remote is that it has to be pointed almost directly at the receiver for it to work and there is no light on the receiver to indicate if it is getting a signal or not.  My harmony remote on the other hand can be pointed almost any direction and all the commands still get picked up by the receiver."
3746,"Ok, so my original idea was to pop these into a pfsense box, but that was a no-go. So, what I did was put these into a couple of Midnight Dimension 4600 boxes running XP SP3, and they work.MAKE SURE YOU USE THE FULL INSTALLER. I tried to install the driver using the &#34;search for driver method&#34; and that TECHNICALLY installed, but it only worked partly, every other boot, etc. When you run the installer from the disk, it works. Remember, run the installer."
3747,"the Daffodil BT Dongle is a handy little gadget, non-obtrusive [and easily misplaced :-) ] it performed well and allows all the basic BT functions. There were other features I had hoped that I could muster from it but honestly those wouldn't be of concern to a user looking for a basic BT adapter. Nice addition to connectivity needs."
3748,It works very well. The one it replaced just quit so for 14$ or so I was able to get a new one for a really old laptop and it works exactly how it's supposed to.
3749,"This product is still working for my daughters laptop after two years, longer than the battery that originally came with the laptop."
3750,"it seeing to be holding the charge okay,the price for the bat.is also affordable and they send the directions on how to charge it, i would recommend it to my friends."
3751,"Like many reviewers here, I'm a long-time Kensington ""big ball"" user. I've tried other trackballs, but nothing has ever topped the big Kensingtons.I've watched this product evolve over 2 decades of being a trackball fan - my first was an ADB (pre-USB for Apple) version. The previous Kensington models -the ones with steel bearings inside - tended to last 3 years or so for me. Towards the end I'd have to start taking them apart, cleaning the rollers and lights, and eventually the bearings would dry out. My last model was an ""Expert Mouse Pro"" and when I saw it had been discontinued, I was worried - the newer, black Expert Mouse is a huge disappointment with it's tight and rough rolling.The Slim Blade is a giant relief for me - it is SILKY smooth - the ball seems to be rolling on air. The low profile design feels great, too - I've played piano since age 6, and been a serious musician/artist for well over 30 years - so my wrists and hands are ""fine tuned"" to fine motor movements and it's easy for me to hurt my wrists - even the quarter car wash wears my grip out quickly. The new low profile just feels amazing - your hand and wrist sit in a very natural position. The software works fine - I can program the thing to fly across my two large monitors.I still can't believe the basic mouse is still manufactured - a well-made trackball is massively more efficient, and along with the keyboard, it's how you interact with your system. The Company J for doing things like tight selections in Photoshop and the speed you can move across lots of screen real estate is amazing - your fingertips do everything, not your elbow and wrist. You don't need a clear spot on your desk, and you don't have to do the lift-slide-lift-slide thing to cross two monitors.What a relief that Kensington still rules the world of big balls. Give one a try -  it takes a day or three to adjust and get where you're not thinking about it - and after that, you'll never go back."
3752,I have used this carbon fiber tripod for 4 years. I have used it and climbed it up and down mountains. it has all the features of a high end tripod but it wears out faster over time.
3753,"as stated above put 7 0r xp on it and you will be happy for Everyday computing use as HP calls it.not real good for gaming no overclock am2 board so upgrades are limited memory is good up to 8gb ddr2.only one pci express x16 bad spacing for pci and cables, also as usual usb2.0 are not high speed doubt you will see speeds over 20MBs.fire wire is no better hard drive is 500bg pretty small not much for upgrade cable or power wise.I do like the processor very cool and strong can do real multitasking without pause or lag, I tested against one of the new Core i3-330ms it destroys the poser.amusingly enough the 330 actually froze up for 3-5 seconds uninstalling software and changing user accounts no big task.also boot time and app exec are much better on AMD even though it is 2+yrs older and much cheaper.yes I do realize laptops are a bit less powerful due to limitations in heat dispersal and space.also intel hd graphics is a joke not a funny one either my couple year old budget card laps it by 3x.so to summarize still better for gaming or anything than a mid-high end laptop and 1/3 price.as a footnote the puny atom is about 1/20th the power and no multitasking plus pumps out 60-65cs so stick with a desktop if you can more bang for your buck."
3754,"I over clocked these modules to see how they would handle it even though I had no intention on maintaining the OC due to inability to dissipate the constant heat very well, but with AMD's overclocking tools they took the different timings and frequency very well. However, it did not like to keep the settings; every time I restarted the computer they would clock back to default settings despite my having tried to same them a lot of different ways. These modules were not really made to be taken above the factory 1333Mhz so that could have been the reason the clock would not keep.Again, it was not why I bought the modules to begin with and I am very happy with how these sticks have turned out and the price point on them was very reasonable for the value I got. I would recommend them to anyone looking to pick up extra memory that they just want to drop in, and have work right out the gate. If you are looking to over clock then you will want to find another solution as these are not particularly designed for those purposes. To gain the OC, you can't be too cheap :P"
3755,"I'm not a computer whiz but, so far, this has been a good purchase. I base this on price and performance. I didn't have to dig into my savings or max out my credit card to buy it and as far as performance; no problems thus far. I don't get into overclocking or anything like that so I don't know how it would perform under those conditions...only want it to perform the basic pc functions. I would highly recommend consulting the Crucial website to verify that the memory you are purchasing is compatible with your system first."
3756,"Programmable keys are fantastic and putting whatever information you wish to display on the screen is nice.  Can auto switch profiles when programs are launched.  Would recommend, but one gripe:  Lays a bit flat and the thumbstick is a bit stiff.  Was hoping for a more analog experience but the stick only replicates 4 buttons depending on direction pushed.  Makes using as a WASD a bit of an adjustment when trying to achieve console quality movement."
3757,"For the price you pay, these are really good speakers. I installed it at the rear for my 2000 mit eclipse and drove them directly from my Pioneer DEH-P5900IB (4x14 RMS) HU. Now, the reason why I didn't give this a 5-star rating is because, I am comparing them with the stock 1-way infinity speakers. The Pioneer is a 3-way, so you will feel the difference in the high and mid range instantly. The low range freq, however, is NOT MUCH better than the stock Infinity; it is only SLIGHTLY better. The real improvement in low freq output for these Pioneer spkers can only be heard IF you play original CDs that is well mixed by the producers, such as Michael Jackson's Dangerous album or Madonna's Immaculate (I am an 80's/90's person). If you burn your own CDs at 128 kbps transfer rate, and play them thru these spkers, the base improvement is only marginal. Yes, the highs and mids are obviously better since the stock Infinity DOES NOT have a mid and tweeter. And if you play songs thru your IPOD, at a low transfer rate, the improvement in low freq with these Pioneers isn't fantastic.Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that there are NO improvement in the low freq at all for these Pioneer speakers, just that I expected more. But at that price, you may consider my expectations as unrealistic and that I am not making a fair comparison with 8 year olds Infinity spkers.  8)Nevertheless, I will be buying the Pioneer 6.5 component speakers soon for my front speakers... Right now, these 6x9s are overwhelming my front stock speakers...At some point, I will also install an AMP to drive all these Pioneer speakers. I think the sound will be much richer then (and clearer).But regardless, if your budget is tight and you don't want to install an AMP (yet), these are good speakers to buy."
3758,"The thing is large. I have an ASUS Z77 mobo and I had to put this in sideways. ALSO, this is important inf you have an ASUS Z77, this fan will NOT FIT with all 4 RAM slots populated. I had to move my dual channel RAM to slots 2 & 4 for this to fit. Even then, the fan is still slightly pushing on the RAM stick in slot 2. Slot 1 is completely covered. It did fit in my Mid-Tower ATX case but definitely wouldn't fit in a MicroATX Tower.This thing is large, but my computer is running very cool so I'm happy with it. I have it set on the lowest possible fan speed (for noise control) and everything is still running cool. I haven't tested it with my more intense COMSOL multiphysics, or ANSYS FEA analysis yet (they tend to heat things a lot), but for daily applications everything's been great.I do also wish it were a little quieter. It's by no means &#34;loud&#34; but I wanted near silent on the lowest speed."
3759,The thing better than my stock cooler. I used it for my overclock. The max temp is 59c now. The only problem is that it is hard to install.
3760,"This is a good heat sink and fan for the price (currently installed on lga 2011 hexa core 3.4). Unfortunately it does not fit snug against the CPU. I added an additional washer to the mounting bracket to further secure the heat sink down, but still even with all screws fully tightened this unit will easily rotate.  Fan is very quiet."
3761,"I haven't done anything outside of the normal clocking on the 3570k, however, this fan has done what is expected like a champ."
3762,"I got this lapdesk for working on my 13-inch MacBook Pro while in bed.  It looks great, is comfortable, and so far seems that it will last for the forseeable future.  I really got it because of the high amount of heat that notebooks put out, which is uncomfortable not to mention bad for the ""boys down there"".However, there are a few things Logitech could improve on.  First, the surface is a bit slippery.  It's not totally slick, but my notebook, with all it's rubber feet, still can slide around rather easily.  Second, I wish it were adjustable, because comfort depends on how your legs are positioned.  I find myself spinning the lapdesk around too much in order for it to sit properly based on if I'm on the bed, on a couch, etc.  Third, the lapdesk is a bit too flexible--it should be more rigid.  If you cross your legs so one side is elevated a bit higher, it creates a slight flex in the surface, so now your notebook no longer sits properly, which allows it to slide around that much easier.Overall, this lapdesk is pretty nice, and it should work great for most people out there."
3763,"Case suffices to protect Kindle (and its screen) from scratches.  Leather sides aid in carrying the case.  Case does not open completely so that the Kindle can be viewed like a book - it is just a protection for the device.  Unzip - pull out Kindle.  Case construction is good, and it should last as long as the Kindle.  Can't add much more - it is, afterall, just a zipper case....."
3764,"I bought this for my fiancee after she went overseas primarily for Skype video chat and because she like to watch things and play games from time to time. For the most part she is very happy with it and loves it. I played with it before I sent it to her. Updated it and installed items. For the most part the computer itself performs well. I would have given it 5 stars but Vista just rubs me the wrong way.I was jealous that it came with bluray as I have a Toshiba Qosmio and bluray has yet to be included with that model. Oh well. She definitely has an advantage with this model. I'm an IT and I was already a fan of HP so to see her smile and be excited was enough for me to be pleased with another product that they released. Definitely a great bargain.For those parents looking for something for their college kids and still give the great power and performance then this would definitely be a great investment. Primarily because its a name you can trust.17"" screenplenty of memorygreat processorblurayJust buy it!"
3765,"I bought two of these to go into the front of an Antec 300 case.  The fans are quiet, and move plenty of air for my needs.  The only reason I rated 4-stars (instead of 5) is because I have not evaluated comparable fans in this class to make a good judgement of how great they really are."
3766,"Este peque&ntilde;o radio permite sintonizar estaciones am y fm con rapidez y se oyen muy bien con la corneta que trae, adem&aacute;s permite grabar las transmisiones en am o fm pero con una desventaja: debe colocarse el maximo volumen para que la grabacion se oiga bien, del resto el aparato es muy bueno, ademas puedes guardar tus canciones en formato mp3 o wma y con los audifonos obtener gran sonido; otra cosa buena de este radio es que ya viene con pilas recargables y con un adaptador de corriente que permite cargarlo en unas tres horas. Disfrutalo, es bueno."
3767,Its a SONY.  Enough said.  Quality built.  Reliable.  Study.  Tough.  Takes clear photos.  Holds up to pocket or purse.  Battery life is very good.
3768,"It is a basic keyboard, with basic multimedia controls. It came with a USB to PS2 adapter. I like it, the keys are easy to press, the bottom row of keys are sort of rounded at the bottom which took a couple of uses to get used to, but after that I no longer notice. The keys are quieter than the Midnight kbb that came with my PC. I would certainly buy another."
3769,"I bought this after getting my daughter the 10X zoom Z915, and desiring something bigger, zoomier, and more expensive to stay king of the castle.  My daughter now leaves her camera at school and uses this one to do her assignments around town.The 24X zoom performs as promised, and the functionality is simple to operate.  I guess the real question is whether one needs such a zoom, which then requires a tripod in all but the brightest light for sharp pictures at full zoom.  The wide lens lets in a lot of light, helping some.The fixed LCD on the back remains exposed and thus also needs a case more than the reversing LCDs on some other cameras.  The constantly adjusting focus, if one uses that setting, is kind of busy and distracting, although it performs well.Overall, the camera is a good compromise between a ton of features and a 600+ mm lens, a moderate price, and the added work to haul around and use compared to a simpler, lighter, and smaller point-and-shoot camera with less zoom.  I can't imagine why anyone but a pro would get an SLR with interchangeable lens anymore - cameras like this are so much more convenient and plenty capable.The bottom line is that this camera is easy to carry in one hand, starts quickly.  It zooms, focuses and shoots fast, and the pictures look great, especially when my daughter takes them.  In the end, although I usually only use a zoom of 10 to 15, it's good to have the ability to zoom further to select the right parameters.  My daughter, the more demanding of us, says the photos from this camera are sharper and just bettter than her Z915, so in the end I'm quite happy with this camera."
3770,"Cheap wall mount, but I don't like how it's split into two parts. That makes me concerned about structural integrity for larger tv's but for my 32&#34; application I didn't get bothered by it."
3771,"After going through 2 generations of the lumix TZ series (TZ3 and TZ4) which served well as multi purpose cameras, I wanted a multi-purpose camera that also had better video quality and superior low light capabilities. Here is my why not others comparison (it may not match with your needs, but it might help some of you)Panasonic Lumix ZS1 / TZ6 vs Sony H20Lower quality video (same as  WVGA resolution as the TZ4), and could not adapt to the different lighting conditions like its higher model TZ7 (something that Panasonic does not mention clearly so be vary).Panasonic ZS3 / TZ7 vs Sony H20Unfortunately seems to have fallen prey to its high reviews with the price at $399 (even with weekend discounts it was around $340).Panasonic has decided to clam on cheap batteries, so you can't use OEM batteries with the latest firmware (needed as it supposedly fixes the autofocussing issue in videos).  This mean you need to bust out 50-60$ for a spare battery, and since the new battery is smaller than the one's used in the previous models, you need the spare.[Update] Price has dropped considerably, but the battery prices still remain ridiculously high.  After market batteries that work around the chipping proof logic seem to be available but no guarantee if they will work, so not worth the hassle.  One more issue i came across after i tried the unit was that Class 6 SDHC is not good enough to record video in high quality and you need to spend loads of $$ and get high speed SDHC if you want to record in high quality :(Canon SX200 vs Sony H20The canon SX200 though having good picture quality and full manual controls was out simply because it does not have optical zoom in videos.Samsung WB550 vs Sony H20Optics that match the Lumix TZ7 in spec, and yet offering all what the Sony has to offer, so in theory its the camera that's the all rounderBut the reviews highlighted the picture quality was not very good and had the purple fringing problemUncertain quality of samsung camera (Since the samsung mobile phones are a bit low on reliability from experience)Therefore i came to the conclusion the best alternative to the Lumix that also matched my needs was the Sony DSC-H20 though knowing that the lack of a true wide screen (38mm vs 28mm in the panasonic) may limit my landscape shots and group photos.The initial impression once i received the unit was that it was definitely not as slim as the Lumix cameras, and the build quality while good for a plastic unit seemingly a bit fragile compared to the all metal lumix.  I guess its going to take some time for me to shift from the lumix mindset :) The positive being that this sony model was made in Japan.However the pictures confirmed what the reviewers said that it was camera with good potential. The daylight pictures are superb, and the focus is much faster than the TZ4 i had last.  The macro mode is able to go much closer than the TZ4 (and even the TZ7), and i realized this meant even better close up pictures. The video quality in good light is superb, and the zoom speed is decent, and smooth.  The jump to 720p HD is definitely noticed compared to VGA/WVGA and you will not want to revert back :) The Sony focussed quite well while zooming in video mode compared to the TZ4 (and i heard the new TZ7 panasonics also still have this problem).Then i tried the indoor pictures, and the quality again was very good (My wife said the pictures were definitely a lot more clear and vivid compared to the TZ4).  The dual shot capability is also useful, though in most cases the second option is useless as the modes used don't seem very intelligent. The flash definitely is very powerful, and works well even to provide background clarity. The video indoors is much better than my TZ4 as it adapts well to the low light, and in high sensitivity mode while the video can be a bit noisy it still able to provide fair footage.If you are the forgetful type remember to set the flash to auto, if not you are are going to be disappointed when the shots turns out grainy when taken without the flash.The menus are fairly easy to use the feedback from the navigation buttons are bit less than the TZ4, and i miss the context menu capability of the lumix.  Sony hiding the settings menu and requiring the user to press ""."" at the last menu option is unnecessary initially then i realized its to keep the menu's slimmer with the options required for normal use available, and only the lesser used options are in this hidden menu.One feature that i thought the camera had was that it could increase its optical zoom to higher values just like the Panasonic range (e.g. in the lumix when i set it to 3MP, the zoom increased to 15.9X from 10X optical).  However seems the Sony cannot do that, and only has the digital zoom increasing and this is of no use.Another useful feature is that you can press the play button when the camera is switched off to view the photos on the camera without having the lens come out.  The play button also works when you connect the USB connector to connect to the PC again without the lens mechanism getting activated.PROSGood picture quality both outdoors and indoorsVideo is very good, and does well in low light as wellVery good macro photos10X optical zoom an asset for an all purpose cameraNice features and smile shutter works well (yet to try blink detection)Fast focusing specially in low light conditionsLightweight and well balancedNice 3"" LCD which shows pictures wellManual mode useful for indoor and night photosCONSLens cover is a pain, and would have preferred an automatic option like in the lumix, this also makes the camera a bit more bulkyNot a true wide screen optics, so you have a limited view in wide modeOnly 3 modes for video VGA (4:3), and high/low HD (16:9).Use of memory stick as the storage medium :(A slimmer profile would have been nicePop-up flash while effective also mean you need to pop-it in backFlash recycle time is slowManual mode has limited flexibility[Update]Sold the camera the shutter lag and long flash recycling did not suite my type of photography sadly."
3772,"Pros:  Voice activated directions, bright vivid screen, FM transmitter pretty strong, compared to some other devices I have owned.  Accepted an 8GB micro SDHC card with music and photos, no problemCons:  Should give longer than 3 mo for a map upgrade.  I would thing 6 mo, or a year would be nice.Screen doesn't show distance to destination. (Shows the time to destination , then you have to go to a sub screen to see the distance.  A lot of other GPS' allow you to configure what you want on the screen.  This one doesn't.To use the voice activated directions, you have a device that attaches to your steering wheel.  I travel with mine, so I am afraid I will lose this, or forget it in a rental car.  I'd like to see a menu item that would take me in to the voice recognition module, w/o having to carry that unit with me.It could give you a bit more notice before the turn.  It does .4 or .3 mi in front of the turn, so you are aware, but it struggles with the timing of ""take next left on ____ st"".Overall, not perfect, but I would buy it again."

3775,"After my skull candy headphones broke, I decided to go the less expensive route. I really like these, the sound quality is good (although the ear buds are not noise cancelling as the name may suggest, I like them and I didn't spend a fortune!Edit:They broke after a few months, but overall I'm still happy with their performance. The price wasn't bad and the sound quality was good."
3776,installation takes some time but thats to be expected. after all is said and done it works well. my only complaint is with the provided extension cord... it's sooo bulky and sticks off the wall alot.
3777,"I've been waiting for this for 3 years, but didn't order it until recently when they finally got the glass-break sensors (not included).I started with this kit, but added on extra entry and glass break sensors, as well as an extra siren.This could be installed quickly, BUT I prefer using screws rather than the tape, so my installation and testing took about 3 hours total.  It could have been done in 10 minutes, but I was really playing around with the sensors to check their sensitivity and best placement.I think it's missing from the manual, but the motion and glass break sensors can be adjusted by popping out the battery.  It doesn't way anywhere what the range of high, medium, or low is, however.  But I've found that the motion detectors will sense motion pretty well at about 30' on high.The system is VERY easy to program using the USB remote.  The base station will give you an annoying warning if you don't sign up for monitoring.  This can be turned off, but you need to contact Simplisafe to get a downloadable update.I don't like that the alarm audio chimes and verbal commands ONLY come from the base station, and not the control panel.  I'd prefer them from the panel (or both), but this isn't possible.  The chimes and verbal commands give away the position of the base station (though not in alarm mode), which decreases my security level if, say, a contractor were in your home and later told his buddies.The reason I wanted glass break detectors is because in &#34;home&#34; mode, the motion sensors are set to off.  My windows and doors are not easily opened and an intruder would have to break or cut through.  So I'm hoping the glass break detectors would help with that.  It's unclear how well they will work though.  They can (and have) been set off with false alarms if you have someone jumping upstairs.  But I'm not sure how well they'll work if the glass is quietly broken, as the sound of breaking glass isn't always as loud as you think it is (ignore what you see on TV and movies).If your windows and doors are barred (highly recommended for security), then you really don't need entry sensors for every door/window.  Go with motion sensors and glass break sensors instead.Pros:Relatively inexpensive (for both the kit and additional sensors)Easy to useEasy to installWireless set upOPTIONAL monitoringCan hide base station, though it needs to be near an outlet, and they tell you not to place it on the floor, and if you want monitoring, you may need it in a place with an adequate signalCan easily expand system to more sensorsCan add sensors to sheds or other areas that aren't even in the house, as long as they're in range.  Try that with a wired system!Cons:Can't get wireless alerts without paying for monitoring (even though this would be easy to hook up to a router if they would simply allow that)Unknown glass break sensor effectivenessNo verbal commands or chimes on the panelThe sensors feel/look cheap (plastic bodies, small screws), but this probably keeps the cost downKey chain has away, off, and panic, but no HOME alarm setting.  Why not???Non-standard batteries -- these aren't too difficult to find, but you won't be getting them at Costco.No camerasI didn't remove my existing alarm and actually use both.  A bit overkill perhaps, but may as well make life harder on burglars.I do recommend this over any other system, even though it's not perfect.  Great value for the dollar, but can get expensive quickly if you try to get a ton of sensors."
3778,"I was once helping another musician friend with cable roll-up duty and noticed this amazing little cable tie attached to one of the cords. I asked about it and was told it came with the cable. I examined the brand and found it was (of course) Planet Waves. I have a number of well loved and often used products from this inventive company.I wanted to buy some immediately  but, at that time, they were not available for sale from PW. Then one day, Company A, in its often creepy customer tracking intuitiveness, popped them up on my interest list and BAM! I bought a pack of them.They clip right on to standard sized cables with a ""hair band"" elastic loop that wraps around the cord then attaches to an indented hook-like part of the clip. Ingenious! I have seen people use actual hair bands with a large, plastic, festively colored ball attached. They work too but the PW cable ties are not as noticeable.I dinged them a star only because the attaching clips are too small for larger cables and too large for thinner cables. Although they still are functional (they still wrap and hook around odd sized cords) you may loose them being that they are not clipped to the cable. I'd buy more clip sizes PW, thnx!"

3781,"I have had this stereo for about 2 years its still works great sounds great i only have a few gripes, one is that the selection for tuning a station is not as simple as 1,2,3 you have to dial it in on the knob so this becomes cumbersome if you are driving. second some of the options can be somewhat confusing when trying to program it. there are some options that as a user you really shouldnt have access to but they are available. the tuning problem is solved with the remote, as long as you can find it because its the size of a fob for a car alarm. the cd player works great on reading the mp3s it has a display for album,song,etc this also works on the radio stations that transmit in hd, as long as there are stations that broadcast in hd in your area. the cd player once it has been playing for about 6 hours straight it seems to get hot and stops reading the cd.....i am not sure if its the cd itself but you can turn the unit on and off it reads it again....overall i would recommend this unit for anyone"
3782,"Update for this case in Jan 2011 - This case is just like a Noreve case it is just black smooth material with an embossed cowon lettering throughout the interior. It doesn't have the red velvet inside as mentioned by the reviewers, so it must have changed. It fits nicely, allows access to all the ports but doesn't have the red velvet which I was looking forward to seeing to add a luxury feel to the product.  New buyers keep that in mind when reading the reviews."

3787,"This Kenwood subwoofer is really awesome. It performs great and has never given me any problems. The only thing i don't like about this sub is the fact that it's 4 ohm. That basically means you won't get the true power out of the subwoofer. If you hook up 2 subs correctly, they can turn into 2 ohm, but you have to buy more than one sub. Eventually i'm upgrading to a dual voice coil subwoofer, which is 2 ohm and can take a bit more power. But overall, this subwoofer is a steal for what you pay for it."
3788,"This camera is good.  It is easy to use.  The picture quality is excellent.  The only problem is that it does not take batteries, so you have to make sure you charge it up everytime you plan to go somewhere.  It's not like you can pack a couple extra double A batteries in your pocket just in case.  When the battery runs out, you're cooked usless you can get to a computer or electrical outlet to charge her back up.WAIT A MINUTE - just when I thought it was safe to put up a positive review...now the battery has decided that it can recharge in about 4 minutes, but then when you go to use it, you can only take about 5 pics before it runs out. So, left it charging for a couple hours, but then used it for 5 minutes and guess what?  ran out in 5 mins again.  Basically the camera is useless now and I wish I had my money back."

Get theAcer Aspire One Accessory Kitfor a good drive. The mouse in the kit fixes all touchpad complaints, and the case prevents too many scratches."
3790,"It's an excellent little camera and does everything you expect. The positives are numerous so let me just point out a couple of the negatives.- One of the advantages is the huge screen; however, it is very delicate. Mine broke in a soft case. I was at an amusement park and pulled it out only to see a wildly colorful display. It was not cracked on the outside but must be cracked internally. It's just hard to believe it should be that delicate. The camera was never dropped.- The huge display is very hard to see outdoors- Indoor flash pictures are not the bestOverall I really like the camera but I will definitely be more critical of the display on these cameras in the future. Given that it is exposed they definitely need to be much stronger."
3791,"I have owned the 1 GB M240 and the 2GB M250 nd love them both. Use them mostly for listening to podcasts and while exercising.Works well with Songbird, or simple drag and drop files directly on the player. ALso nice that this uses a standard USB-miniUSB cable to connect to the PC.This player supports so many standards that I can take it anywhere and get data from any machine.Buying 2 more extras for when these go out of production."
3792,"These earbuds sound about as good as I suspect bluetooth can, and are the only wireless earbuds I've found anywhere that I can honestly describe as comfortable and well-designed. This setup quite simply makes all other design efforts look bad. I don't mind the lack of controls-- I've always done everything through the phone anyway-- and my only real caveats are the annoying paper tag you're not supposed to remove and the short battery life. I recognize that the latter is probably unavoidable, but anything that could be done to improve battery life would be _most_ welcome. Also, it would be _very_ helpful if this device was USB-chargeable. I carry a large battery with a USB port on it to recharge my stuff, and have no access to an AC plug for most of the day. Active noise cancellation would be nice too, but is perhaps too much to wish for.I like using these earbuds so much with my iPhone 3gs that I plan to buy a second pair to give me enough battery life to last through a work shift, so that in essence I'll be paying over $200 for something that a single pair of, say, Motorolas might theoretically do for about a quarter of that price. But these are _comfortable_ and _loud_ where nothing else is, and therefore well worth the extra expense and trouble of having to keep two pair on hand."
3793,"We purchased this just before Hurricane Irene hit the Northeast in August 2011.  Although this radio provides a USB port and a means to charge your cell phone, you'll NEVER be using it as a cell phone charger unless you're desperate.  Here's why... Instead of draining the battery of the device, you have to use the hand crank, even if the on-board battery is charged.  You have to crank it about 120 cycles per minute or 2 Rotations per Second.  I tried it for about a minute before my arms got tired realizing that I'd have to extremely desperate to charge my phone this way.Other notes. We found the weather radio to be quite functional along with the flashlight and such.  No complaints there."
3794,"I found the Eton FR 600; on sale at my local Brookstone store for less than what I could buy online anywhere (Including Company A).  If you look at the reviews for the Eton FR 600 here at Company A, the Eton got mixed reviews, when I was looking at this item (for example) 12 people had rated it with one star...  So it seems that it was nice to actually try it out in the store before I bought it at the store [sorry Company A] and the unit I bought worked well.  Reception on all bands was good: AM, FM, NOAA.  It also is supposed to receive short wave but I'm not really into SW so I can't really comment on how it does with that.  I really like the digital tuner with the preset memory... many emergency radios out there are analog, which means you have to search for what you want every time... so 20th century.The other cool thing about the Eton FR600 is this new S.A.M.E. feature which allows you to enter the code for the county you live in and the NOAA alarm will only go off if severe weather is headed toward your county (instead of 3 counties away).  Real nice feature if you choose to set the radio to alert you in case of approaching severe weather; not so many ""false"" alarms.  You have to go online to get your code and it's only for counties in the U.S. and Canada as of this writing.  You can also enter multiple counties for this selective SAME feature (I guess in case you have loved ones elsewhere?).I like being able to crank this thing for about 2 minutes and listen to the radio for about 10-15 minutes; not great but doable if you HAD to hear what was going on via radio; basically just crank it when the program ""goes to commercial"" and you won't miss anything important.  Other reviewers have mentioned problems with solar charging through a window... It is a bit tricky, especially with the short days we have this time of year but I've had success with laying it on it's side or tilting it directly at the sun (and then moving it periodically to make sure it is still facing the sun).  I have no doubt this thing would be great on a sunny day at the beach.  The fact that this also uses ""conventional"" batteries for the back up to the rechargeable batteries is also nice.  Multiple power sources means that, in an emergency, at least one of them will be working for you.  The light on the side of the unit is nice as an additional feature; can't have too many lights in a power outage.  It seems reasonably bright, just for kicks I shut the door to the bathroom and used only this unit's light to go through the morning routine ~ sufficient for that job.I was disappointed that it did not come with an ac adapter (because it takes one, and a mini USB power input too) but I'll probably buy one from Eton soon.  Agreeing with others who have posted here, I was disappointed with the manual, one of the many shortcomings is that it says nothing about specs to use the mini USB port to charge the unit and good luck trying to get more info off of Eton's website.I guess my advice is to give this little radio a try, run it through it's paces.  If you got a quality unit keep it.  If not Company A has a great return policy.  Otherwise you could always check one out at your local purveyor of radios...- - - - - - - - - -  U P D A T E  1 / 31 / 2011 - - - - - - - - - -I called the Eton toll free number (1-800-872-2228) and asked for technical support.  After a short wait on hold I spoke with one of their tech guys, Walter Hess.  I called because I had just received my Eton ac adapter and both the manual and the unit say ""5V"" but the adapter they sent me said ""6V"" and when I tried it a RED light came on the unit (when I was used to a green light when I cranked it).  So Walt told me that 5 to 6 volts was acceptable and that the red light is to indicate charging via ac.  Then I told him what I thought of the manual.  He said that they had just updated it and he emailed me a PDF of the new manual.  If you want to email Walt yourself and ask for one here is his email:   - - - - - - - - -  U P D A T E 11/ 29 / 2011 - - - - - - - - - -One other tip for everyone.  The unit takes 4 AA batteries but keep the batteries in a drawer nearby, not in the unit, until you need them.  The batteries seem to be used if the ""dynamo"" batteries get low, even if you keep the setting on ""dynamo.""I hope that helps.  Take care everyone."
3795,"These are no hi-fi ear buds by any means ( For that I have myEtymotic ER23-HF3-BLACK HF3 In-Ear Headsetwith 3-Button Remote Control for iPod, iPhone, iPad (Black)).What's great about these Wicked buds is their small size.  I can fall asleep with them in my ears and they're so small and comfortable I can sleep on my side and they don't dig in to my ears.  I get to fall asleep to music and don't bother my wife.  The woven cable covers are really durable too, so all my tossing and turning doesn't ruin them overnight.I love these little things.  As I said, the sound quality isn't great, but it's good enough for what I want them for."
3796,"You plug it in, it works. Not much to say. However it doesn't charge my iPad-1 as fast as the Apple or Gomadic 2-amp chargers; I suspect this device is a bit over-spec'd.I have been a long fan of Gomadic. The only reason I didn't buy their product here is that they don't offer a 2-port charger with a folding power plug.Also Gomadic doesn't take PayPal and I am no longer to put my credit card # into any old Web site. Never had a problem with Gomadic ... just being more careful than I used to be."
3797,"This is a great improvement over the previous Sony digital recorder I purchased.  The buttons are smaller, so if you have larger hands or fingers, you might have to take it slowly when operating.  All-in-all, a good buy."
3798,"I used this to hang my 40&#34; LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50&#34;.  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs."
3799,"I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen (47&#34; LG) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off!  After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?Fast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4&#34; since there is only a screw on the bottom.Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20&#34; extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47&#34;."
3800,"Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device, the interface was terrible.  It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device. We returned it within 3 days.Next we tried the original Nook Black&White;, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast. (not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)Enter Nook Touch.  WOW.  This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.  Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.  On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.  The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!The size?  PERFECT!  Not too big, not too small.  Very thin.  Well built.  Feels durable.All I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.To boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!"
3801,I couldn't have asked for a better product! I upgraded from the Nook Color to the HD and I am super happy!!!
3802,"This little microphone transforms my iPod into something much more useful for recording events.  There is no way to listen at the same time, but that was advertised as such.  Thank you."
3803,I needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv.  Did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables.  Cables work and were cheap.
3804,This works great. It shouldn't be that difficult and it isn't. We used it to connect an iPod to my wife's car stereo. The sound is just fine--much better than an FM transmitter we used in the past.
3805,I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo.  I did not want a CD or tape player.  This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.
3806,this cable is very good i recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend iti recommend it
3807,Does the job I got it for at a stellar price. No complaints. Buying from Company A saved me money. I would have paid a lot more had I gone to Radio Shack or Best Buy.
3808,I have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer.  I would definitely purchase again. Thanks.
3809,"Well, it has taken three weeks and three different online companies to get the Palm V to me.  Was it worth the wait?  You bet...although it's a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and LCD screens.  After filling up  my address book, downloading e-mail and news (through AvantGo), as well as  various applications and games I still have about 768K left.  2MB may seem  like a small amount of storage to some people, but it goes a long way as  long as you manage your e-mail, games, and amount of AvantGo channels you  read.  The HotSync operation only takes a few minutes, and I spent a total  of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti  language.  Once fully charged, the battery never seems to diminish no  matter how much I use it.  Even though the Palm V did not come with a nice  checkbook program, I found a free one immediately at download.com.  Now  that the US version is sold out in most places, I would highly recommend  considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the  same as the US version with an international AC adapter."
3810,"Should have copied my comments from the other CAT 5e cable I endorsed.High quality product, fair price and reliability are the reasons I chose this product."
3811,"Cables showed up exactly like I expected them.  Packaged neatly and correctly.  I honestly don't know what else to say, they are exactly as advertised."
3812,work great
3813,The Brother M231 1/2-Inch Black on White Tape for P-Touch Labeler is a very good purchase.  I have been using Brother products for years but I especially like this purchase because I can use it for creating files or placing it on the outside of the building for tenant apartments bells so fedex and UPS can locate the tenant for deliveries.  It is a great purchase and I highly recommend it.
3814,I bought this CB radio for my Jeep.  I use it when I am wheeling with my Jeepin' buddies and it works very well.  I like how I can plug it into my Jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the go.
3815,"Shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product. The lock and cable appear to be of good quality. The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models. It was listed and purchased as a used item, but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones. How much abuse can a lock like this take? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Company A. If there is ever a problem, it is accepted back immediately."
3816,"I don't know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap; they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions, but the sound is even better. They are powered with a standard 50-watt Sonos receiver/amplifier unit, and still sound teriffic.  In fact, I like them so much that I'll probably take them down for the winter, to avoid having to replace them in a few years."
3817,"I ride a scooter (aka Vespa) and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp3 player while I'm riding, so I decided to buy this and so far I'm pleased. I love how I can clip it on my shirt and easily access it. One thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go. I believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great. Overall I'd recommend it based on my experience."
3818,"Work well and easy to use.  The cord is to short, but the sound, build quality, and weight are are outstanding.  These headphones excel in these most important areas.  I will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set."
3819,"I've been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under $100. That might not be correct, though... You may have to go up to $250 to find cans as good as these. For the price, they simply cannot be beat. They are light, super-comfortable, and they sound great. The only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently, the cord *will* break. It's not even a matter of ""if"", it's a matter of ""when"". I've gone through 4 or so pairs of these things. They're cheap though, so it doesn't bother me."
3820,they work well and seem very strong. more than enough length on the cord and extremely great sound.
3821,"I have owned a lot of headphones over the years, and I have never found any reasonably priced headphones that approach the sound quality that these have.  Yes, they aren't exactly stylish - the design dates from the 1980s and it shows.  But there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years.  You don't survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for it.They aren't perfect for all occasions - I wouldn't go running with them because the old-school foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty.  You could use them on a plane, but they don't have any sound-isolating/noise cancelling features and they don't isolate your ears.  But for like commuting on the subway, at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep, they are perfect.  Good base response, but nicely balanced throughout.  Crisp, not muddy at all.  They hold up well if you don't abuse them, I had a pair years ago and they lasted a long, long time."
3822,I like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my (large) head.  Good sound and comfortable enough :)  They seem well enough made.
3823,"These are by far the best headphones i have ever used. Agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time, but the sounds completely makes up for all that. The bass is perfect.. great treble and mids.No complaint what so ever."
3824,The construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb. It is lightweight and comfortable for long hours.
3825,Someone told me that Plantronics was cheap but I beg to disagree!  Yes; the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is great.
3826,"It's not a solid 5 star, BUT it still deserves it. At this price, the sound quality is wonderful. I did burn-in with an app on android, using pink noise. Before the burn-in, the sound is good but not smooth enough. Now it just sounds right. The sound is much smoother. Good build quality. Nicely packaged. A decent leather bag is included.Now the CONS or insufficiency:1. don't expect light weight but it is ok;2. cable is ""telephone wire"", maybe good for moving around in studio, but ugly and unnecessary for other use;3. the can doesn't hug your head tightly. It is comfy for home use but you probably can't go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail.Overall, a great quality headphone for the price. Try it with flac/ape against other can, you will feel the great sound quality."
3827,Best headphones i ever bought! Fits on my head perfect no need to press down on it to feel the bass! Works well with trance music! Alots of bass!
3828,"I bought a set of these to replace an old set of MDR-V600 I had that were falling apart. These are great phones for the price!  Very light, good reproductions, comfortable to wear.  The headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the V600 but good enough.  I'm sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency, but for my money these are the BEST in their price range."
3829,"Nothing fancy here. I ordered two of these 10 foot usb extenders and they do exactly that, extend my usb devices. Awesome."
3830,"I used to be a professional photographer, TV news videographer and news producer, so I was weaned on high quality broadcast quality TV pictures from expensive pro equipment. They are sharp, with excellent color and low noise. Consumer camcorders, even digital ones, left me cold. They just didn't cut it compared to the pro gear I had used. That is, until I saw the Sony TRV900.This baby is really a sleeper. The picture quality from this 3 chip camera is professional quality. The picture is very sharp, digital artifacts are not noticeable, and the picture is amazingly noise free, even in marginal light. (In low light,it's noisy, like all CCD cameras.) Manual controls on almost everything let you tweak the picture as you learn more.It doesn't look &quot;pro&quot; so it might not impress your friends, until they see the results. And the sound quality is not quite up to the picture quality, at least with the built in mics. But if you want to really do some fine quality videography which could be shown anywhere, even on network TV, this is your best choice."
3831,"I have had one of these receivers in my collection for about 17-18 years.  I have been worried it will stop working, so I looked around for a new one to replace it, found it and the price and delivery were great.  Radio arrived new and well packed exactly like I expected.  Nothing bad here, this purchase is all good."
3832,"I have used both Western Digital Green 1TB and Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 1TB in DLINK 323 NAS device for about a month. These are my experiences... Seagate didn't need firmware update.Packaging:WD was packaged very well with cushion padding where as Seagate was packed really lousy. I had ordered 2 drives in each brand and one of the seagate boxes looked like it was opened already (may be it was human error while packaging; I didn't bother).Noise:Seagate is noisier than WD but it is much smoother than WD. Meaning, WD produced lot of hard clicking sounds that really irritated me (both drives; may be just the two I received were defective). Clicking sounds from Seagate felt normal to me (and it was muffled).Heat:Seagate got much hotter than WD. I figured WD didn't produce as much as heat because it uses ""intelliseek"" that runs the motor at optimal/slower speeds rather than the advertised 7200rpm.Speed:I couldn't compare speed as I was running WD in RAID1 and Seagate as Standard drives.Overall, I am very happy with Seagate mainly because of its much smoother operation and brand reputation.Hope this review helps!"
3833,"This switch is now located behind my entertainment center.  It handles the Xbox, satellite, blueray, desktop computer and a spare wire for a laptop. It does a great job and the price including shipping was better than the local shops."
3834,"I bought this to supplement my internet connections for my home theater system. I have my office with modem and router upstairs, and powerline networking for downstairs. Lots of people dump on powerline, but I have NO problem with it. I used this connection for my PS3, because I personally hate wi-fi, especially for gaming. I recently upgraded my TV and theater system to internet connectible equipment. My options were to buy a new powerline adapter for the multiple new connections, use an old router I had laying around as a switch, or buy something like this. I am glad I went this route.The unit is very solid, and heavier than you would expect just looking at it, but that doesn't matter, because you wont be holding it. It really is as trouble free to install as everyone says. I have ZERO loss of speed in PS3. I can even can still stream Vudu in HDX with full strength. This unit is attached to a Belkin Conserve power strip, and comes on like a charm everytime power is restored. If it helps those with a similar setup, here's what I got:Sony Bravia 46"" TV ethernet connected, Sony Blu-Ray home theater system ethernet connected, and PS3 ethernet connected to this switch. Everything is connected to Belkin Conserve Smart F7C007q AV Energy Saving Power Strip (TV master)with Netgear powerline adapter providing the internet connection from my upstairs Netgear router.And finally: Yes, it is only 10/100, but find me one thing in your home, starting with your modem and signal from your ISP that needs more. If you aren't a business or have a super home network based on 1000, you really don't need it. This will be fine for 99% of everyone, and perfect for home theater uses."
3835,"I recently replaced my cable provider with AT&T;'s UVERSE, a combination of internet, cable TV, and telephone.  My PCs and other devices were hooked together with a Linksys network, but the installer told me that the Linksys devices wouldn't work properly with his equipment, and everything had to hook directly into the AT&T; box.  After pulling lots of cable, he hooked up 4 devices, and that was it.  Everything else had to be wireless, or I was told to get a Netgear switch.  After some internet research I found I could probably get the Linksys to work, but the Netgear was reasonably priced and should be worry-free.Sure enough, the install took all of 5 minutes, including swapping cables from the AT&T; box to the Netgear box.  Everything worked perfectly, no problems encountered or adjustments needed.If you have UVERSE, and need more ports for your devices, this is just what you're looking for.  If only all networking problems were this easily solved!"
3836,"Don't think of it as a VCR, think of it as a personal broadcast network that only broadcasts the shows you like, only when you want, and without commercials.I've had one since June and it's rendered every other TV in  the house obsolete.With TiVo's current $50 off recommendation from  existing TiVo owners through November, it's an especially good bargain."
3837,I have always used Linksys products and very good reliability from them. This is no exception as soon as I applied power and hooked up all my devices the unit performed without incident.
3838,This handheld is made with great quality!  I myself had a Palm M105 which has very similar stats.  The Palm Vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome!  I would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or work!
3839,"I like this a lot.  It has a longer cord than most power strips.  It is also a soft cable so it is easy to organize.  For the discounted price, this is a super deal on a great strip."
3840,Kind of pricy but I have forgotten it exists which is exactly what it's supposed to do. It survived multiple power outages and the color coded plugs are nice. Other than that it exists behind the table in a shivering world of dust bunnies and small toy parts that my kids have lost. It would be nice if they developed technology for the surge protector to self repair using the bunnies and small toy soldiers but until then I guess it does it exactly what it says.
3841,Did exactly what I needed. Split the cable from my wall to the TV and Cable Modem.
3842,"Easily installed in my PDA, this little chip lets me store hours' worth of MP3s for portable listening.I can also use it in my digicam to store hundreds of photos at a time. Voila! No more lugging a PC or PDA every time I plan to take pictures."
3843,"These are full length (700 MB) disks that are able to take advantage of today's faster CD burners (my 24X Yamaha burns a full one in &lt;3 mins!). The price per disk can't be bettered, and the quality of the first 50 I got was 100% perfection. Sweet!"
3844,"I had given that honor to the (now sold out) Kodak 280, but the Olympus is now the clear winner. Its classical, Stylus-like design is attractive and functional. It is well made, well-balanced in the hand, and has intuitive controls and menus. It features 'burst mode' shooting (great for sports events, etc), superior optics, a great 3x (plus 2x digital) zoom and USB transfer (though only a memory card reader will make you love the simplicity of digital cameras). The included 8 meg SmartMedia card will handle about 100 480 X 640 pics, and larger cards are easily found and reasonably priced. The 1.2 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for everything from emails to printing 5 x 7s. The flash, battery life and software are acceptable. The price is a real bargain and makes this the #1 mid level digital camera at this time."
3845,I was very pleased with this product. It worked beautifully.Unfortunately it could not be used with newer PDA's.
3846,"This is my second Microsoft mouse since December. I purchased the Intellimouse Explorer as a Christmas gift to myself and loved it. The size and button placement never bothered me, but the color and overall  appearance did.Microsoft got it right with Intellimouse Optical! Its  color more closely matches the rest of my system, the placement of the  extra buttons is admittedly more logical, and the price is even cheaper!  Best of all, it's identical to its more expensive sibling in terms of  features and performance.The included Intellipoint software allows you  to customize the mouse action (scrolling speed, cursor speed, etc.) and  cursor appearance to your liking, and each of its five buttons can be  reprogrammed to perform some other function if you'd like. As with the  Intellimouse Explorer, my favorite feature allows you to lock the scroll  wheel by depressing it momentarily. Then, to scroll through a document,  simply move the mouse upwards or downwards. The farther upwards or  downwards that you move the mouse, the faster the scrolling speed will  be.It's rare for me to spend this much money on a product, especially  when a previous product is functioning properly, but I gladly parted with  the money for Intellimouse Optical. It performs beautifully, looks and  feels great, and is worth every cent of the purchase price."
3847,great product - and at this price - truly an amazing buy!  you can't go wrong here.
3848,"I bought this product three years ago.  It is a high quality product that works well, for a very reasonable price.  I bebated between this 12x25 higher magnification and a lower power Bushnell.  The issue was a smaller view with higher mag and more optical leverage and shake than the lower power.This higher power binocular was not too much magnification.  In fact, a lesser power would be too weak.  This unit has the needed power to really get a closeup view.  I would think the lower mag would disapoint most people."
3849,"Have tried different scopes and binoculars and this is the best for my backyard and woods. Easy to use, I support my elbows on the desk, and am able to use without a tripod. Perfect birdwatcher!"
3850,This has now  been running for 8 years and it rarely gets turned off.  Wish other things lasted this long.
3851,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 64MB SmartMedia Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs."
3852,"First headphones that I can wear with glasses that are super comfortable for long listening periods.  Fantastic sound, very long cable."
3853,"I got this for power outage times, but find I use it in the shower and in random moments where I feel a good song is what I need. It also reminds me of my grandparents house where they always had one just like this (only metal) sitting in their bathroom. As a kid I would always play around with it, antenna and tuner dial, it was fun."
3854,"It was cheap, or rather I should say inexpensive. Lightweight, comfortable and the sound is very good...  I despise the ear-bud type headphones and these sound better to my ears. Can't beat it for under$5."
3855,"I purchased two pairs for my kids (8 and 10) to use with an iPad in the car or on a plane.  For kicks, I tried them on my Macbook playing back lossless audio tracks from iTunes.Turns out these diminutive headphones sound really good, much better than I expected given their price.  Not exactly hi-fi, but nothing's missing, either.  Tight enough lows, no edginess to the highs.  And they weigh almost nothing so they're comfortable for long periods, even over glasses.For the money, it's pretty hard to go wrong with the Panasonics.  Cheap headphones for the kids, an upgrade to the cheesy phones the airlines hand out, or a decent option for iTunes."
3856,"I love them.  I bought them to replace another pair of cheap, light-weight head phones that I use for nothing else except listening to my radio in bed, at night, when I'm wakeful.  They sound really good and the weight and shape of them makes them comfortable to wear."
3857,beats the earpieces in your ear by a mile--i use it while walking--so i am not too voncerned about ll the features--it LETS ME HEAR MY MUSIC
3858,I use it for bird photography when I need to spot birds. Clear and easy to focus better than spinning a ring. This feature is important because a difficult focussing system is not useful in bird photography. It is also light and does not slip in your hands.  More power makes difficult to spot small birds.
3859,"How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.

3860,I am able to get clear and crisp images of landscapes and cityscapes. Would recommend this product to any photographer.
3861,"Certainly a better us of my hard-earned government pension.I spent about the same amount of money on my FIRST new car:a 1972 Chevrolet Vega -- boy! Was THAT a waste of $1875...spent the ame amount on my Canon binoculars, and CAN even seeSatelites pass by... if I'm patient.Imissd the asteroid last Friday, but Russia didn't. Sorry, THATwas uncalled for.Great bi-nos!"
3862,"This keyboard feels very much like a regular fullsize keyboard. I found it easier to use than the smaller versions. The keys have a great feel to them, and your hand rests comfortably in position. There are even places to put your stylus. I love this thing!"
3863,I have 2 of this and I'll buy another 2. This camera has no cons for me if you know what you are getting. I need controllable light and this bad boy does the job! I had on of this on a light stand and fell - and nothing was broken. If you are a fancy photographer then go for the more expensive ones. It is all about the light not how much your flash cost that makes good lighting. This is excellent for manual flash as I don't do TTL. I have a 580 EX II that I use indoors but this always comes with me day or night. I use 4 Eneloop rechargeable batteries on this flash and it just keeps flashing consistently.
3864,"This bag is well worth the price.- Black color doesn't get dirty.- No ostentatious logos, doesn't scream ""EXPENSIVE CAMERA IN HERE.""- The outside is made out of a tough fabric that seems fairly water repellent and won't rip or tear. I wouldn't go and submerge the bag, but if you're caught in rain you shouldn't have to worry about your camera getting wet.- Has plenty of padding.- Spacious interior - more than enough room for a Digital Rebel XT/XTi. If you have a bigger camera, it will most likely fit inside as well. I find the extra space left over is useful to hold my wallet and iPod, in case I don't want to carry another bag.- Two pockets, one inside and one outside. Great for storing lens filters, lens caps, small papers, and memory cards.- Adjustable and/or removable strap. 4 D-rings to attach whatever you want. Loop in the back so you can use a belt or a chest harness.If you have a big camera with a big zoom lens, you might want to get the next size up. On the other hand, if you want a snug bag for your small DSLR, then the Mini would probably be better."
3865,"Cables are always a hassle. Laptop power cord (actually 2 cables), phone charger cable, even that rats nest behind the computer, these keep things neat and tidy."
3866,This is my first use of a trackball and I far prefer it to moving the whole mouse around.  Very smooth action and precise.  The wireless feature is perfect.  Line of sight is not needed.  Totally frees up the mouse with no cord.  Just makes it a clearner operation.  I got use to the trackball with my thumb in a day or two of use.  Now I wouldn't trade for anything.
3867,"I got this during my freshman year of college and am really glad that I did.  It helped keep me organized and was cheap enough that it didn't break the bank.  I could also play games before the professor/instructor came to class.Suggestions:I would definitely suggest getting a case for it, so you don't have to worry about the cover flipping open. I would also suggest getting a keyboard for it because you can type your notes out and sync them with your computer when you get home.  Get an extra stylus, too.  I lost mine a few times (always found it), but that what you will have one when you need it."
3868,"What can one say about a mouse? In this case, a lot! After years of taking apart mice (mouses?) for cleaning, I finally have a permanent solution. I actually bought this mouse a year ago, and have waited to review it until now.The optical nature of this mouse means that there is no little ball to pick up dust and crumbs and collect them where they don&#8217;t belong. The rolling action on this mouse is just as smooth as a normal mouse, and yet the optical feature is great. Frankly, I cannot imagine going back to a regular mouse.If you need a new mouse for your computer, then I strongly recommend that you buy this great mouse!"
3869,"Try using USB Overdrive instead of the supplied software.Once you use a wheel, you can't go back."
3870,"First off while the name given by Company A only lists the 580EX, 550EX and 420EX speedlites, the STE2 transmitter will also work with the 430EX.I got this transmitter after being inspired by the potential an off camera flash can have after reading Strobist. I got two 430EX flashes to get a very portable and easy to set up lighting system.The STE2 Transmitter allows you to control an unlimited number of flashes in a few different ways. As long as the visual signal can reach the flashes, they will fire (indoors this is easy because the signal bounces off walls).The STE2 lets you control the relative flash output between two flashes (or groups of flashes) through a simple control on the back. For example you if you set it to 1:8 between A and B, B will get 8 times the 'power' as A.Even without two flashes, the STE2 lets you move the flash away from where the lens is and creates more pleasant lighting. Additionally, if you take photos of people with glasses or of objects within glass, you can angle the flash so that glare is eliminated.All in all a great investment, I doubt I will mount a flash directly to the camera ever again."
3871,"We purchased this bag to carry a Rebel S1 and it works perfect. We have a 75-300 mm  lens (it barely fits), the camera with a 18-55 mm lens, a spare battery and the battery charger. there is some room left for a few filters. the camera comes with a shoulder strap that can be adjusted and a belt strap that can be concealed when not in use."
3872,"I love this remote with the 7D for several reasons.One, it is tiny and light and comes with slots to mount it permanently on the Canon camera strap that is supplied with the 7D (and other Canon D-SLRs).  So mounted, it is so small it is unnoticeable. In fact, for several days of shooting I forgot it was there!Two, the piece that mounts to the camera strap is actually a remote cover that the rest of the remote clips into, so you just pull a small recessed tab on one end of the remote to remove the remote itself, and the cover also serves to prevent button presses while the remote is clipped on, preserving the battery.Three, the cover/clip design seems quite robust and I do not fear losing the remote, so I plan to keep it on the strap eternally.Finally,  the remote supports the optional mirror lock-up 2 second delay for tripod mirror vibration elimination.  Combined with the camera's AEB feature, you can simply momentarily press the remote button once then sit back and marvel as the camera:opens and locks up the mirror,waits 2 seconds,snaps 3 bracketed frames instantly.Recompose and repeat at will!You end up with perfect, vibration-free HDR with very little effort(at least with the 7D -- I have not used it with the other compatible cameras).  Of course, you don't need to use the 2-second mirror lock-up feature and/or the camera AEB feature to get benefit from the remote, but I love to use these features."
3873,"This remote does everything it was advertised to do.  It has great range as long you are in front of the camera.  For a 'behind the camera' remote, you should get the wired RS-60.  This remote has a nice fast response time - making family portraits with the kids and the dogs and everyone trying to run away a little easier.  Just turn it around in your palm, or crop out your hand and no body will notice you are using it.  It is better than the RC-5 because you can choose the instant shot or the delay.Pros:  works great - just as advertised.Cons:  ...... still looking for one I guess."
3874,"I have the discontinued wireless remote that occasionally worked for a while but finally gave up for good. This one is fool proof. Its hard wired, so it works every time. Their is another wireless by canon which I will eventually try."
3875,"I always use a remote when shooting on a tripod and sometimes when i'm not. I like to shoot evening and night shots. With a remote I get less vibration which is a killer for long exposures. This is my second remote (for a different camera). I've had the first one for about 3 years and have never had a problems of any kind with it.  You can pre-focus with this remote as the button goes half-way down just like your shutter, or you can push it all the way down if you are manual focused.  There is no risk of radio interference from other photographers with a wired remote.  The length of the cable is adequate for most all situations.  I keep the remote in a ziplock baggie in my camera case at all times."
3876,The ruby pearl color is real attractive and makes the thing look like a 1955 T-Bird or something. Glad I bought it.
3877,"These zip ties are for sure not going to break on you.  I was zip tying 0 degree weather and other brand zip ties broke in half when they got too cold, and so i tried these and they held with their normal strength, very pleased."
3878,"I found the bag to be the perfect compromise between portability and storage space.  It fits my D50, 3 medium sized lenses and SB-600 flash in the main compartment.  The camera is easily accessible by lifting the top flap, which can be closed either with a zipper (for storage or transport) or three clips (useful while shooting, when you don't want to mess with a zipper).  The pocket in the inside of the top flap is perfect for holding filters, while the flip down side pocket provides convenient storage for memory cards. I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the side pockets, which have non-ideal velcro closures that make me wary of placing anything breakable in them for fear that they will fall out.  However, the pockets are still useful for storing lens caps, a blower brush, etc.  The strap is very comfortable, and I've found it easy to carry the bag on my hip for long periods of time.All-in-all, I'm impressed at the amount of thought that went into this bag.  Highly recommended."
3879,"Image from this lens is superior, deep and field come incredible and very sharp pictures. The macro allow you to take very small objects...almost every picture I take with this lens come out as high quality wallpaper.It's a little bulky but this is what you can expect considering the optics involved.Highly recommended."
3880,"I got this product 8 years ago and it's still running good. This product was discontinued by Cisco after acquiring Linksys and [...] was showing it's a power line A/V adapter what a joke. I got help by learning from users' reviews from Company A that it requires a static IP address to function. I reset my EFSP42 during DSL(static setting) to FIOS(DHCP setting) conversion then I lost the access ability to configure this device because I reloaded Bi-admin management utility but it can not locate it. Bi-admin needs IPX/SPX to function I discovered this hint from google search. This product can be run under IPX/SPX, TCPIP, MAC and EFSP42 is a very popular product when Novell/Netware was a king before Microsoft/Windows.This product has gone through, Win95/98/2000/xp/vista/sorry not windows 7, Apple talk and Netware PC client life cycle and retired gloriously."
3881,"I purchased this Handspring Prism so i was able to store my contacts. It not only stored all of my contacts (approx 325) but also let me sync with my computer for emails as well. This prism takes the place of my smartphones ( one got wet, one was dropped and the third was given to my granddaughter). I love the color and the ease of putting info into the unit. This unit may be old school but still very functional in todays world."
3882,"I use this to take notes in class and it has worked very well.  It is actually quieter than most notebook keyboards and more like a standard keyboard in the way it feels.  You can make it almost completely silent if you place a magazine under it.  The space bar is split into two keys, which took me a little while to get used to because my thumb is used to hitting the space bar right where the split is.  Of course, the FN keys are also missing, but I haven't needed to use those for years anyways.It folds and unfolds easily and quickly.  Its very sturdily build and of high quality.  The little wire and plastic flipout that props up the journada seems flimsy at first, but I've had no problem what so ever with it.  One minor drawback is that you do need a flat surface to make it work.  You can't use it on your lap.  Other than that, this is just like using a full-sized keyboard except that you can fold it up and put it in your pocket!"
3883,"When people talk about this or anyother EOS lens and the 28-105mm digital being equal to a 44.8-168mm film, You need to understand ""THIS IS NOT AN INCREASE IN FOCAL LENGTH"" but instead is the crop factor. This Lens 28-105mm WILL NOT MAGNIFY THE IMAGE EQUAL TO A 48.8-168MM FOCAL LENGTH LENS. It instead has a field of view ie:""CROP FACTOR"" equal to a 48.8-168mm film lens. The only way to increase the magnifacation is to increase tha FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS=PHYSICS.Thank YouMichael E. Burk"
3884,"Purchased as a gift and it was a great hit, just what he wanted and couldn't find in the store"
3885,"Was upgrading and cleaning my gaming rig. As an electrical engineer, you can never be too safe when touching small pieces of electronics. I decided to pick this up and I guess you can say it worked great haha. You don't want to run the risk of picking up any type of electrostatic discharge on valuable and expensive hardware. This is a must item!"
3886,Does what it is suppose to do and I use it for a controller keyboard. I bought  3' because ti limits the ltency between the controller and computer. Going with a shorter cord has worked like a charm. Good product!
3887,"It's pretty hard to screw up a thing as simple as an ethrnet cable. I guess any ethernet cable would do, but this has been perfect so far."
3888,"Beware, as it is but 2.0. Other than that what else is there to say about an item like this one? Maybe I should add that it seems well made and came in good packaging."
3889,love this item can't go wrong. Works as described. What else can I say it does what it suppose to do
3890,"If you have a few days, know what you need as far as plug end style, and can factor in the shipping costs (I ordered with another item to get free shipping), this is the best way to go for computer and data cables.  With shipping, the savings is small on one cable.  Two or more, the savings is significant.  The local chain stores, such as Best Buy/Radio Shack/Sears and even Wal Mart, make a killing on overpriced cables.  Belkin is good name for a quality product.  No problems.  I hooked up my new Canon laser 4-in-1 across the room (under edge of carpet) with the cable.  Works great."
3891,I have a Toshiba Satellite (L645D-S4030) and I needed some laptop tools to install some upgrades. The Philips screwdriver worked perfect to undo the back panels which is mainly what I needed undone.
3892,Tiffen has been around a long time. Why? Because they make good products. This is one of them. Worth the price.
3893,"Took it with me on my trip to Italy...made my photos really come out crisp and colorful and not washed out.  You have to remember to remove it, when necessary."
3894,"You have to have this for better quality photos, both indoors and outdoors. Its easy to assemble and it protects your lens glass"
3895,"I got this filter for my NX20 but it didn't seem to fit my camera lens, but besides that, the picture quality was great in very lit up areas, and it pretty much does what you'd want it to do."
3896,"I have a Canon 5D Mk 2, with L series lenses. I have more expensive filters by B&W and this one looks just as good! They are stackable as well. I have a 3, 6, and the 9. You can screw them together to make it even darker and do really long exposures (4 seconds plus) without it blowing out! My advice is it's great buy all three!"
3897,This product does the job it is intended for. It is well made and does not affect the quility of the picture. I am very pleased with this filter.
3898,"Fit nicely on the end of my Canon EF 28-90mm lens.  Takes good(not great) photo's in most light conditions.Like the title says, for 7 bucks shipped I'm not sure you can beat the protection.  If you want high quality glass and perfect shooting in every condition get out your checkbook."
3899,"Um... it's a UV filter... and it fits 52mm lens... um... um... and it's clear and stuff... Oh, and it's very rigid! Buy it!"
3900,This is a very reasonable priced filter that helps both protect your lens and assists in diminishing light glare.  Worthwhile to have it on your lens at all times.
3901,Good protection for my lens without sacrificing imagine quality and sharp nessHas protected me from damages many times already
3902,"Always secure your camera bag cover. I wasn't paying attention and tripped in a parking lot. I saved the SLR camera I was holding but my telephoto lens came out of my camera bag and landed on the asphalt. The UV lens protector took the brunt of the impact as it was shattered with the lens cap partially wedged into the ring. Amazingly, I removed the lens protector, and found the lens to be intact with no loss of zoom or autofocus!"
3903,An insurance policy for you lens. I'll gladly replace one of these over a lens.  It's very clear and doesn't have any ill affects on your photos.
3904,"Picked these up for use with my NEX 5N. I use them in a variety of settings and have been very pleased with the results. The carrying case has been very helpful and since I don't have a lot of other filters to fill it up, I keep some spare memory cards in there. I have exposed them to some less than ideal conditions and they haven't scratched or smudged and seem to be of a rugged construction in addition to their great optic quality."
3905,"Kodak makes great film, and 400 speed is the only way to go.  You may thikn this is overkill, but consider that if you are taking pictures of kids, you need a slightly faster speed than 100 or 200 so your photos do not get blurred. With nearly all cameras these days, you can always adjust your speed down (so if you have 400 film in the camera, you can set it for 100).THe actual picture quality is very good, with grain structure great and holding well up if you blow it up to an 8&quot;x10&quot; print.Best part about this film is the price... you just cant find this price in Wal-Mart"
3906,"Works great. Extremely fast installation. Perfect for being between a router and a computer. I have my wireless router hooked up to a modem, and the DI-704 hooked up to the wireless router to act as one of two firewalls before reaching my desktop computers. Very energy efficient too :)"
3907,"I needed a long, cheap cable to connect TiVo to my home network, and this did the trick! Now I can transfer recorded programs to my computers to view later."
3908,"bought this with my radeon 6870 hd and it pulls out alot of heat, works great and no problems, will update if i run into a problem."
3909,"Great power cord, It work well I am recommending you to purchase this product it well last a long time"
3910,With this cables you can't go wrong. This cables are perfect for my job. I'm a KJ/DJ and I need use this cables to connect my equipment to my rack. I centralize all the connection with an eliminator 10 switches.  The cables are very good quality and the price is just right. Good product
3911,"I bought 2 other brands and found that unplugging sometimes pulls the plug out with it - I've been shocked more than once and also tripped a breaker.  The Tripp Lite strip is excellent - very robust and I have no issues with unplugging.  The cord is much longer than my needs, so I've had to get creative about tucking it away."
3912,The product performed flawlessly.  I've purchased about 40 of these disks for a special application and they work as expected.  There are no negative aspects to them.  They've formatted and work great.
3913,"I have another but decided to get more to accomodate my extensive electronic collection and to better protect them (very important). I went to best buy once to get one and the look on the girls face was one of &#34;what are you talking about&#34;. I don't shop there normally, but I thought I'd try to see if they had one. Not even the manager knew what it was, I had to tell them. This product will do the job very well!"
3914,"I offered (stupid) to fix my nieces old emachine XP computer that quit working. It got hit by a power spike which killed a memory chip.  I replaced the memory, but the on board NIC wouldn't work.  I ordered this very inexpesive card hoping it would work.  I pluged it in and booted, it self installed but I did not see the New Hardware Found message.When I rebooted I noticed that during startup, the system paused and attempted to boot from the new NIC card (i.e. network boot).  After 30 seconds or so it would then continue on with the normal startup.  The next time I booted, I hot the key to enter BIOS.  I made sure that the boot order didn't include the NIC and also remembered to turn of the on board NIC - but it still tried to boot from the NIC first.Finally I saw a message pop up for 3 seconds right after the manufactures screen where you can hit a key to go into BIOS and when it frist tried to start up.  IF you hit Shift-F10 you will go into the NIC card setup.  You can turn of trying to boot from the NIC card first.  Other than that is works great for about $8."
3915,"It's a fast fan that brought down my case temperature by about 7 degrees C, which is a significant improvement. For about $8 it's a good investment even if it is a little loud. It fit perfectly right below my graphics card."
3916,This monitor extension cable has worked fine to extend a cable that was too short. I've had no problems with this product.
3917,I have not encountered any problems yet meaning surges or overloads but I know from the reviews that it will do its job and protect any devices connected to it.
3918,"I had read all the reviews on this product, and most of them had a positive review, I decided to purchase the product, and yes! it was that easy to set up, and it's working great... no problems to date... this product delivers.. 110% satisfied customer... Before purchasing this product, I had heard that setting up a network was going to be a hassle.  but with this product, It was no problem, everything is automatic, you just plug it in and the router configures it self. even when I have friends come over the bring their laptop plug in into the router and have instant net access, no need to configure, the router does everthing automatic.  Now, that's automatic!"
3919,Nice blurry backgrounds at F2 and with a Double dip how can one resist.  If canon upgrades this the price on that will double like the 24-70 and these will hold there value and with the beautiful pictures who needs the next version.....
3920,"Sold it after a year because I was tight on money and few months later I bought the consumer grade Canon tele zoom for those odd shots. Tried to believe that I dont need the focal range that much so I stayed on the non L canon and even tried the cheap Sigma telezoom. When I was reviewing the pictures on the album in my computer with my wife, we notice that the pictures taken by the Canon 70-200 F4 non IS are outstanding. Hands down the best telephoto lens that I use I don't care when people say that it is comparative to consumer lenses NO IT IS NOT. My wife even notice the difference and she doesn't know anything about photography. I bought another copy because I know I gotta have it. Something in the glass that makes this lens outstanding. I do understand if some people say that they are on a tight budget but this is the cheapest L you can get and if can afford it....you owe it to yourself, trust me it's that good. Needless to say that it is awesome period."
3921,"I use it for everything from portraits, weddings and everyday shootings.... fantastic results and good bokeh."
3922,"I was sort of dreading getting a new modem to replace the one leased from AT&amp;T Broadband.  You know how every new thing for a PC takes a day or two out of your life to get it set up?  Not with this!  AT&amp;T support had me up and running in less than 20 minutes.  (The support guy said his record for Best Data modems is 8.5 minutes, but I held him up because I hadn't even unpacked it, yet.)Seems to run faster than the 3COM I had before, but I don't really have an objective way to measure that."
3923,"I bought this product when my old ball mouse went kaput on me.  So far, I'm happy with the optical mouse.  It glides effortlessly across the mousepad, unlike my old mouse.  What I like best about the optical versus the ball is its maintenance.  I don't have to worry about dust and particles finding their way inside the mouse.  Therefore, I don't have to take it apart to clean it, as I had to do with the old mouse.The scroll wheel was cumbersome at first; however, if you click gently on it while the cursor is pointed in the scrolling area, it works just fine.  This mouse comes with software, although it works fine without.  It also has an adaptor, which allows you to hook it up to a USB or PS/2 port.  I haven't tried it on my Performa yet, but if it works I think I'll go out and buy another one."

3925,"I was waiting for a good deal on a 128MB secure digital card and the offer for this card came through my gold box coupon. I decided to give it a try since the price was so right, even without the rebate offer.I tried it out on my Kodak digital camera (DX4330) and it worked fine right from the start. With the card formatted, the camera said I had only about 103 pictures at the highest quality (3.1M pixels). But I think the camera just gives worst case scenario. I ended up taking about 175 test pictures at the high resolution. I downloaded the test pictures onto my computer and examined them carefully - they looked great with no problems whatsoever. Also, the total size of all 175 pictures was around 123MB. Guess I lost about 5MB, but I think that's expected. (With the same camera and a 64MB card, I never get more than 62MB of total pictures captured).Sent in for my rebate and will update here when I get it. Even without the rebate I think that this was a great buy!Update on rebate - got it about 8 weeks later. Took a little long, but it finally came. Really glad I decided to try this out!"
3926,"Although I'm hardly an expert photographer, I feel like one now with this camera.  I love just about everything about it.  First of all, it looks like a real camera, not one of those pieces of junk that pass for cameras these days.  It takes incredible pictures right out of the box.  I have the option set for the camera to ask me everytime I take a picture whether I want to keep it or not.  That way, I can quickly zap any bad pictures.  The LCD monitor is easy to see so you have instant feedback as to whether or not you want to retake the picture.  The manual was very well written -- I spent a good deal of time reading it.  Even thought the camera does many things, the menu function is very intuitive.  After a day or so, I was able to do pretty much anything, even use shutter priorty mode or aperature priority mode.  Although many software programs have color options, I love the fact that you can shoot in black and white, color or sepia tones.  Also, this camera has both a digital and an optical zoom -- beware of false claims by other cameras.  I did a great deal of research before buying this camera and I'm happy to say after a month of using it, I have not been disappointed at all.  Some suggestiosn for accessories:  buy a card reader!  You don't want to drain the battery by using the USB cable right from the camera.  They only cost around $35.  You'll want at least a 64 MB card!  The one it comes with is too small (for the price of this camera, I think Olympus should throw it in).  The battery it comes with was dead on arrival and since it is not recharchable, forget it.  Buy AA rechargable batteries (one charger, two sets of batteries) and switch them often.  The batteries lose charge fast when you use the monitor feature, so beware and carry spare batteries when you travel!  A great camera."
3927,Reminds of the Deadliest Catch where they have to spool in the long fishing lines in their spoolers.  Everybody who sees one wants one.
3928,"I've been using this card with Minolta Dimage 7i for a few weeks. It's completely worry-free card. It works properly, fast and doesn't create any problems at all. It has room for over 100 5M pictures (low jpg compression), so it will be probably enough for the most events. Plus Company A has a very nice memory finder wizard so you can make sure it is compatible with your camera. And price is also great comparing to the other brands. Solid 5 stars."
3929,"I'll try the review again, I guess the first attempt didn't take.. We installed wireless LAN at work, so I thought this was a perfect opportunity to install at home on two laptops. I had also been told I should add a firewall to my DSL connection, I also have 3 Company Ks that would remain connected via CAT5. I purchased the BEFW11S4 and 2 WPC11s and had everything running in about 20 minutes. The BEF* had everything I needed: Firewall, 10/200 switch for the wired Company Ks and 802.11b for the laptops. Because everything is in a single unit, I keep the box count down in my wiring closet. I'm sorry to hear others have had problems using the BEF*, my experience has been great."
3930,"Very good and the best cost for a complete all in one wired/wireless unit. I love this thing. 10 mins or less to hook up, i just unplugged my 2 Towers from my old netgear ethernet switch, plugged em to this one, plugged my USR Veverything 56k modem in, turned on my toshiba laptop plugged in my orinioco pcmcia wireless card - bought the orinioco after reading bad reviews on the smc &amp; the linksys one. but i had an smc card (purchased the smc access point pkg first - now returned) so i did test it against the orinoco, reviews were right. about 15ft away the connection dropped to 45% (smc pcmcia) but the orinoco stayed at excellent 95-100% even after 50 ft. that was with 2 walls and my metal front door. this combo smokes everything else i tried. been running it 24/7 and the printer port allows me to put my printer in a diff room giving me room 4 my scooter (i'm basically a bedridden ex hdware/sftware nasa engineer) so i do know my stuff. get this sucker.. the manual is pretty bad but not needed) so when cable modems are ready in this hick town i just have 2 plug it in. For some reason i had to name the default config network name &quot;WLAN&quot; in the orinoco but that was all. can't recall why i had 2 do that cause everything else in both units was default. u won't be disappointed - for new users it's a snap. excuse the misspellings &amp; run on sent. i'm pretty ill &amp; have eyelid spasms but even that didn't stop this from being one of the easiest setup/config hardware i've ever used."

3932,"I bought the camera for my wife's b-day. She is a professional photographer and she has been interested in dabbling in digital photography. I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case she was disappointed. We are also going to Europe shortly and I wanted a point and shoot camera that wasn't bulky and something that a novice, like myself, could use. At minimum, my wife wanted controls over exposure, white balance, and shutter speed.After months of research I was down to 3 cameras - the Canon S110, A20 and a Sony DSC-P50. Since they all have received very good reviews it was really down to ergonomics and personal preference. ... My wife loved the A20 because if had excellent ergonomics with a grip on the right side and room on the left side for you fingers. The layout of the buttons on the A20 was also straight forward (as were the S110). All cameras had a solid feel to all of them. Personally, I would have chosen the S110. I love the size of the camera.Overall a great camera that met my wifes expectations. We will be taking this camera to Europe and leaving the 35mm at home.Strengths:Ergonomics - the hand grip and locations of all the controls, lcd, and viewfinder remind my wife of a 35mm camera. The camera also has a build in lens cover when off. Size - not too small, not too big. It is smaller than our 35mm point-and-shoot camera.Photo Quality - excellent excellent excellent. The colors and sharpness are better than I ever expected. Prints come out wonderful.Features - for our purpose it has everything we need. It doesn't have a manual shutter control but that is ok. The auto shutter does a pretty good job. You can affect the shutter speed by placing the camera in manual mode and by using, or not using, the flash.  I also appreciate the camera not having a ""movie"" mode. That is what a camcorder is for. I've seen ""movies"" made with digital camcorders and i don't find them useful or even viewable.Shutter Lag or lack of - this puppy is quick. I pretty much treat this camera like a 35mm point and shoot. This is especially true when the shutter is pressed half way to first set the exposure and focus.Uses AA batteries - this is how it should be (I think the Sony also allows for Lithium batteries). If I need batteries in an emergency I know I can easily find them almost anywhere. I bought a great charger (Maha C204F) and 1800mAH batteries.Price - it can't be beat.Menu Layout - the menus are easy to follow and have a simple hierarchy. I hate having to got through layers of menus to get to where I wanted to go.Download speeds - very quick.Weaknesses:Compact Flash I only - doesn't allow the use of IBM's microdrive. However, a couple of 128MB CF cards have been more than enough for meFlash - it could be more powerful but that could probably be said with all cameras that I've looked at.LCD Screen - the size is fine but it is difficult to read in bright sunlight. I think the S110 has an advantage here.Bottom line ... if you want a great point & shoot camera at a low price then you can't go wrong with this."

3935,"I got the NB-1L battery when I bought my Canon Powershot S200, and I've since bought two extra batteries, one Canon (the battery reviewed), and one DigiPower equivalent.The original Canon batteries perform noticably better than the DigiPower battery, and they also stay fairly cool, as opposed to the DigiPower battery that gets dangerously hot during operation.I've had no problems running my Canon batteries, but the capacity is not all that impressive - hence the 3 batteries. An absolute minimum here would be two batteries for your camera.On my S200 with the LCS screen on, I can get somewhere between 75 and 150 pictures out of one fully charged battery. With the LCD screen off (only a 2 second preview after each picture), I can get around 200 (sometimes a few more) pictures out of one fully charged battery.I've been using my newest battery for about 10 months, and so far I haven't noticed any decrease in capacity. It appears to hold its charge very well for weeks at a time.I would probably have given it a 2 star rating if I took the general battery capacity into consideration, but since you don't have any real options to this general battery type, I'll give it an overall 5 star rating. It performs better than other brands for my camera, and I've been very happy with it in all aspects.I would also recommend that you to buy this battery and not a Canon equivalent from another manufacturer. This battery's worth the extra money!!!"
3936,"WOW! its amazing!did i say its awesome?It has very nice IQAmazing low light performance for photos AND video.Light wightedNOT as bad constructed as many online reviews says.... yes it is plastic.... so?.... well, if you think of knocking it against the floor you'd like to think it twice before you do it... :SAF works fine, a little noisy.... but i wont use it for wild jungle animals.The bokeh is really nice. Some says that bokeh coming from lights with pentagon shapes as a CON... but i say: COOL!Depth of field with 1.8 is impressively narrow... but you loose some IQ at f/1.8. In my opinion, you better use it at f/2.8, get the insuperable IQ of a prime lens and set a more usable and controllable depth of field.Using it for portraits? PERFECTUsing it for cropped landscapes? NICE!And so on....Fully recommendable....PS: I have a canon 550D T2i, APS sensor."
3937,"After downloading the XP drivers for the printer server, the printer worked in both wired and wireless (DWL-120 USB) PCs, XP- and ME-based.  The DMZ enabled feature did allow netmeeting and video-conferencing to go through.  Speed is great and range is adequate for a 100' wide house.  The tech reps were responsive and helpful.  At 8:00 pm EST they were still there, contrary to some other reviews.  Excellent product."
3938,"I use the DM-50 on my Canon HV40 and am very pleased with it. The forward (full) shotgun mode is impressive, as well as the other settings. I bought a Mini Windjammer windscreen for it which helps eliminate wind noise.  I found a sound test for the DM-50 on Youtube.com where the tester recorded audio (with video) setting the mic in each of the three settings. That test sold me on the DM-50. I use a pair of full-ear headphones to monitor while shooting which is highly recommended."
3939,"The Nikon 18-35 is a consumer-grade ultra-wide zoom (the Nikon 17-35 and 16-35 are the comparable pro-level lenses). The 18-35 is much cheaper and lighter than the pro lenses, and the build quality is a little less robust. Having said that, the 18-35 is an outstanding lens for the price, and is very easy to lug around all day on trips. It is well-made and can easily handle the abuse of travel and daily use in basically any environment. The lens feels perfectly balanced on a D700, and I tend to carry that combination all day when on trips.Performance is surprisingly good, with great saturation and color. I usually shoot mine wide open at 18mm (f3.5) for a little background separation, and while the corners are definitely not sharp, they're not distracting. The corners get better a few stops up, but they're never really pin-sharp at 18mm. At settings above 18mm, the softness goes away and the images at 24 to 35mm look excellent. This lens works perfectly for most street photography, family snapshots, action photos, nature shots, and travel photography, but does not fare as well for architectural or true landscape shots due to the softness in the corners, though it's still usable if you're very careful about what you put in the corners. Autofocus (with the D700) is fast and accurate enough for action photos of my golden retriever at close range.I've been using this lens with a D700 for over a year now, and if I could improve one thing about it I would skip the corner sharpness and go for slightly faster glass. This lens really only makes sense for FX bodies, and if it were just a little faster it would really be perfect. As it is though it's tied with the Nikon 50mm f1.8 for my favorite lens. It's tough, light, and takes beautiful images for less than half the price of the pro lenses."
3940,"This is a must have fixed lens for any serious photographer. The small issue it had was - it would not auto focus with my Nikon D3000, but then it is not a AF-S lens, only a AF lens, so was not supposed to do. Even then, I was able to get some lovely portraits in manual mode. Recently I got my Nikon D90 and this lens auto-focuses with the camera like a charm. Of course the Nikon D90 has its own motor. But the lens produces outstanding results, no questions about that. Will definitely recommend."
3941,"To get a 1.8 aperture, super sharp, prime lens ""with"" the coveted Nikon name on it for under $100 dollars is still hard for me to comprehend.  I continue to be awed as I go out shooting in a dreamlike state...  Wake me when its over...  My only lingering question... ""Will it last?""... Hey Nikon, how about offering up some more of this prime candy for some of us who consider a great value an important part of the purchasing equation.  Thanks. enjoy :)"
3942,"I had initially tried the 50mm f/1.8 version and hastily returned it due to its soft image characteristics at f/1.8.  This lens on the other hand maintains great sharpness at f/1.8 trough f/16.  While it is more expensive than the f/.1.8, it is worth the extra money if you are looking for a a lens that you can actually use at f/1.4.  SWM focusing would have been nice, but the focusing on this lens is quiet and fast.  I am very pleased with this gem's performance on my D300s."
3943,"This lens exceeded my high expectations! I read all of the reviews here and did extensive research before I paid this amount of money for the lens. The first thing I was worried about was the reports of slow focus because of the older auto focus in lens gear system. I use this lens on a D300, and though it is slower than an AI-s, I find it much faster than previous users mentioned. (This could be due to the camera, as I have read that on the newer models it does focus faster than the older models?) The lens focus is perfect in my pictures of lighthouses, sailboats and scenery. Admittedly I have not used it for fast action, and it may not be the best for that, but it is not what I bought the lens for. Most of my pictures are of my travels. It is heavy, without a doubt, but it is such a versatile lens for DX. It is a digital equivalent 120mm to 600mm that I can hand hold for sharp pictures even at 600mm. A trick I use with the D300 is to set my ISO with a low of 200 and a high of 3200 with the lowest shutter speed of 125 so with VR if I can take the picture and do my part, it will be sharp. It is a lot of money, but I think well worth it to be able to reach out that far."
3944,"As with almost everyone else who reviewed this product, this is my first dvd/vcr player. Upgraded from stand-alone VCR when dvd players were starting to appear en masse. I wanted a dvd player but during those TRYING times, I also would not part with a lot of my VHS collections. So I got this. This is simplicity itself. Not a lot of figuring out to do. It was meant to be a combo player and thats what it is exactly doing. The build is solid for this machine, I never encountered any problems except the usual skipping due to dirty or scratched discs. In fact, I am still using it till now, 8 years after I bought it and it shows no signs of breaking down. This was my 2nd experience with a Samsung product, the first one being a 35mm film camera and I must say, I am quite impressed with the build of its products. It can play CD's, CDR's, MP3 CD's (yes mp3 files recorded on a cd), VCD's, DVD+R's, DVD-R's, regular VHS and S-VHS. It will not play CD-RW or DVD-RW. This product has served me well and will continue to serve me until it finally breaks down. I highly recommend this!"
3945,"I've had my eye on the C-4040z since about January this year.  After extensive reading, the choice came down to the G2 or the 4040.  The 4040 won out simply for of features-for-price.  And I've not regretted it... (well, until I saw what the 5050 has to offer and now all the regret I have is whether I should have waited for the release of the 5050.)I've had the camera now for about 3-4 weeks.  I've done some experimenting with the controls and considering this is my first REAL forage into the world of photography, I think I've lots of mileage ahead.  The sepia tone function tends to make ordinary shots look surreal.  Photographers have been experimenting with shutter speed for eons, but it just seems so much more awesome to be experiencing the effects for myself with this camera.  And the remote control is a nice improvement on the timer photos of old.Good camera; just about as idiot-proof as it can be yet at the same time providing all the manual controls a non-professional might need to produce all types of photos.  I've had so much fun with this camera, it is unbelievable.The quality of the pictures is astounding.  At 2272x1704 (which gives you 16 picts on the 16MB card), you can manipulate it in so many ways and not lose either quality or content.  I took picts at 1024x768 and the quality was not distinctly different although I assume that the quality would probably decrease with magnification.All in all - this is a wonderful acquisition.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in photography as a hobby.  It's definaltely a little too much for someone who only wants a point and shoot for vacations and the family dog."
3946,"Writing a weekly blog, these were totally necessary accessory for my Dragon Naturally speaking program. Just sensitive enough to work well as I dictate my work, and comfortable for use over a few hours of use. Also great for listening to music downloaded on my computer."
3947,"I've had this in my 2005 Silverado Pickup for 6 years now.  I purchased this unit because I did not want to have to tear up the inside of my truck dash to fit a regular CB.  The unit installs easily. The CB came with a little clip that attaches to the dash, the CB just slides in there when not in use.  I added two detachable Fire Stick antennas and 10-4 old buddy."

3949,"I really love these headphones, have used them for years. Sony to me has always been quality, and something that will last."
3950,"The sound quality is fine.  I've not noticed any difference between these and the expensive HiFI ones I paid way too much to buy.These are light.  The let your ears breathe so in the summer you'll not have to drain sweat.  I can pull a stocking cap over them in winter, no problem.I view them as disposable.  Inevitably, the wire snags on something, and after a few snags, one channel stops working.  Still, they last months and months, and I think they're well worth the $."
3951,"Despite the proliferation of wireless devices, there are times and places when you need a corded trackball. Of all the models of trackball that I've used over the years, Logitech's Trackman Wheel is the best. Ball action is smooth and very accurate. Working it with my thumb is very natural and I have better control & more comfort than with trackballs that use the fingers. Logitech's software for customizing the buttons works great.I've been using the same Trackman Wheen for years, hauling it with me from country to country, and it's still working just fine. It's a shame that this device has become so hard to find, and that the few out there cost 3 times the original price. If you can find a good used one, like I did when I needed a second one for a different computer, grab it. You'll never have to worry about the batteries in a Bluetooth trackball dying unexpectedly, or interference with other devices, or not getting a strong enough signal because the transceiver is attached to a computer in a metal cabinet, or getting moved at work into a space where wireless isn't permitted."
3952,"A couple years ago I'd purchased the cordless version of this (Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel) to use at work, in hopes of eliminating some bothersome hand/wrist/arm pain that I'd started to experience.While I frequently became frustrated in the first couple of weeks while trying to get accustomed to it -- until you get the thumb-ball action down, the cursor can be difficult to control -- I soon found that my pain had completely vanished (helped along, I'm sure, by the fact that I also bought a terrific ergonomic keyboard, theFellowes 98915 Antimicrobial Split Design Keyboard (Black), so I hung in there just a little while longer and sure enough, I came to love the thing and missed it when I was working away from my desk.  Once you find a comfortable place to set it, so that your palm can naturally curve around the top while your thumb rests atop the ball and your wrist is unbent from the elbow, you never need to move your hand or arm to control the cursor.Recently, while outfitting my home office more ergonomically, I purchased this corded version and am even happier with it than the cordless one.  Not only is it cheaper -- and doesn't require any batteries! -- but its darker color helps hide smudges & wear.  Having owned both, I see no advantage in the cordless one: Both mice use a USB port, both remain stationary during use (i.e. the cord never gets in the way or catches on things during use, like with a traditional mouse), and both have a cord.  In the cordless mouse's case, the cord is for the receiver, but it's just as long as a mouse cord and the receiver is not tiny, so there's not really any advantage to having the ""cordless"" one.The only drawback to this mouse is the learning curve.  But once your thumb muscle is trained :), this is a really enjoyable tool and hard to live without."
3953,"This is a wonderful trackball, still going strong after all these years. I learned how to clean it and that helped tremendously (there is a hole in the bottom, use a pen or something and simply push the ball out. all the yuck comes with it). before learning hast, it would get very slow an unresponsive."
3954,"I wouldn't use this all the time, but for those times that you need a B&W photo in less than an hour this stuff is great."
3955,Lens caps come and go and some fade away but a good lens cap all ways comes in handy especially when it is a Nikon.
3956,"This camera has enough good features to make it quite useful. The 2:1 optical zoom is fine &amp; the 1 megapixel resolution is adequate for all internet applications as well as for printing 4&quot; x 6&quot; photos. The docking station included in this package makes this a very simple camera to recharge and it also makes the transferring of images to a PC almost foolproof. That means a great deal, as the 3215, left in its cradle, is always charged and ready to go, and once returned to its cradle, archiving or emailing becomes an easy task even for a novice. The overall quality is okay but not spectacular, with a cheap plastic feel to it. The weight and balance are also just fair. Lastly, the included memory card is too small but larger cards are readily available. Overall this is a very nice package for the casual user or new digital photographer."
3957,"This is a well manufactured, sturdy DVD holder.  I've owned several DVD shelves/racks/holders in the past, and this is the best one.  The metal poles and shelves have a nice solid feel to them, the only weak part being the plastic clips that are used to hold the shelves onto the poles.  They are functional enough, but feel like a weak link in an otherwise solid product.Assembly is a breeze, only took about 10 minutes.  The screws and straps used to bolt it to the wall and keep it from tipping over are a nice touch.  I've had a LOT of problems with DVD racks tipping in the past years, so this is welcome.  However, the metallic heft of this unit makes me think it probably wouldn't tip over anyhow. (though I do have a carpet...)My favorite part is the little ""dividers"" that they provide so you can segment your racks and support DVDs/VHSs/whatever so that half-full stacks don't tip over."
3958,"I picked this camera because it received a 9 out of 10 at cnet.com along with the Nikon but this one was rated as more user friendly.  How true.  It has tons of functions I havent used but I was able to point and shoot for a 5 week trip to the UK.  According to my sister, 4 mega pixels is near professional quality (and allows you to blow an image up really large).  I didn't realize this when I bought it.  I just thought 4 would be better than 2."
3959,"I bought these ear buds to monitor sound input from specialized microphones for my camcorder, but I'm also using them with my computer. Sound quality is very comparable to a high-end headset I've been using for the same purposes... maybe even better. I can pick up sound details in both the high and low freq range you can't hear on our home theater sound system. The base is very strong for an ear bud -- not too strong. The sound quality is so excellent I can hardly see spending any more.I also rate the comfort very high, with the understanding that for any given pair of ears, a given ear bud configuration will seat only so soundly for exercise (retention), or lightly, for comfort at a desk for instance. The diameter of these buds is quite large. When I took them out of the package, I first wondered how they were going to (possibly) seat in my ears. One thing a user needs to understand is that the speaker portion of these buds needs to face forward. In other words, there's a left and a right bud. In my ears (to my surprise), they lay lightly where they're suppose to -- which of course is great for an office environment. There is very little pressure to create hot (bearing) spots during longer use... but as a consequence of that plus, I would think some folks will find (as they might with any other bud) that they might not stay in their ears so well during vigorous exercise. The goals of each require mutually exclusive design approaches.I do however intend to use these to monitor sound during relatively vigorous wilderness filming... and they do seem to stay where they're supposed to be enough that I don't anticipate any trouble keeping them in my ears. The bottom line I think is that you need to choose either a headset or ear buds for either vigorous or gentle conditions. Particularly if your ears are sensitive to pressure, it's probably not reasonable to expect one ear bud or headset design to work best for you over both conditions.Overall then, I don't think you're going to find better sound quality; and I think the large diameter speakers of these ear buds is instrumental. These were a great buy."
3960,"I've owned this camera since 2002.I wanted to purchase a really great camera that was next to professional, as I design websites and have an Interior Designing company and wanted to be able to put up professional pictures of my work on my website.I did an extensive search on the Internet and found that the Powershot S30 was rated in the top 5 cameras at that time for the price range of around $300.00.  This rating was consistent with many top rated sites such as Company A and CNET.It was not what I was looking for in size and weight as at that time smaller cameras were the rave, but I decided to trade that in for it's features and picture quality.  I went ahead and made my purchase over the net.I have not regretted it.  The camera was just as it boasted.  The pictures were awesome!  I still own this camera to this day and among the sea of 8 mega pixels and all the latest rave, my 3.2 mega pixel pictures sits just perfectly right up there with the rest.On the downside, the camera has a clumsy way of powering up and down, as you have to slide this piece of metal accross the zoom lens.  But this is really nothing to write home about.  Also, the delete image button is a little testy as well, but again, you can get around that.Since my camera is 6 years old now I do have some wear and tear and other problems.  when I power up with that sliding metal, the lens sticks and won't open out and sometimes I have to give it a little shake and a thump for it to open out.  If the lens doesn't open out the camera won't turn on.  And that is all the problem I am having now.  I managed to drop my camera a couple of times and even cause some dents on the body but no internal damages... still works perfectly.I wouldn't bother to buy a new camera until it breathes it's last breath, but now I will have to as I am having problems turning it on.  I think it's trying to tell me to let go and move on.  But I'm moving on to another Canon though, they are tried and true.  Although I must say I own Sony this and Sony that, but the Canon Digital camera to me is much better.So I'm on to researching again... although I do say I still see Canon in the top 5 so far.Dione,Kingston Jamaica"

3962,"I just got the Sigma 20mm lens and it is just fantastic! Whether shooting close ups, landscapes or portraits this lens seems to do it all and does it very nicely. It's a solid lens which may put some of those who prefer a lighter lens off. The filter size is a whopping 82mm, focusing could be a little faster and it's a bit on noisy side. None of these attributes is a deal breaker for me, especially since I picked up this lens for $200. I like a hefty lens with a large cap size, I won't be using it for sports photography so speed isn't an issue, I also use a Nikon F4 so obviously noise isn't a factor either. All I can say is if you want a quality wide angle lens, the Sigma 20mm lens fits the bill, especially if you don't want to break the bank. Of course if money is no object I'd highly recommend the Nikon 14-24mm lens, its sharper, faster, and quieter. As of this writing, the Sigma 200mm, goes for just over $500, Ebay, you certainly could do like me and score a used lens for even less. I'm sure there are detailed, scientific ways to measure this lens' sharpness, and again if that's important go with theNikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens. I haven't had any problems with sharpness. Also when considering sharpness one must also consider depth of field and bokeh. I think some of the reviewers may not understand those concepts when considering the sharpness of this lens, also I think some reviewers think only Nikon or Cannon can make a great lens and for them by all means purchase Nikon of Cannon. I personally love Nikon but also use Sigma as well as other 3rd party lens'. If size, weight, speed, or noise are not factors in your photography, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this lens and I'm sure will get some great shots and have some fun with this lens! Don't let the Sigma nay-sayers dissuade you, you love this lens!!"
3963,"After a few weeks of use I am very satisfied with this unit.  As the description says, it will only fit into a cassette deck if the deck accepts tapes end-on.  Sound is consistently good from my portable CD player, the cord is nice and long but not bulky, and the unit seems durable.  I don't know what could be improved."
3964,"We use this to listen to our iPhones in our 2005 Toyota Highlander. I have no complaints about the sound quality, so it gets a good rating."
3965,"These speakers are a steal.  The quality you get for the price is remarkable. Crisp, clear sound mounted in a near transparent mount.  Impressive!"
3966,"Very easy to install, great sound.  Aim-able tweeter helps with correct sound distribution.  Can't go wrong with these, will be buying additional ones for other rooms!!!"
3967,"This product was easy to figure out, and does what it's supposed to."
3968,I bought this speaker wire to connect all of my speakers to my receiver in my home theater system. Sound quality is excellent and cable is sturdy. It was great to see that one side of the speaker cable had writing on it all the way down the wire so that it was easy to keep track on which side of the wire was positive and negative. If you are looking for great speaker wire defiantly buy this!
3969,This RCA speaker wire does the trick. It is flexible and easy to work with. Good quality for the price. Would I buy it again? Yes.
3970,"This speaker wire is solidly built, easy to strip and it's not hard to figure out the negative and positive . 50 feet of wire for $8. can't beat it."
3971,"I bought this speaker wire along with my new receiver, because why not upgrade your wires as well? This wire was a great choice, it is a good gauge, yet still flexible enough to work with easily. The positive side has a tiny but easily discerned white stripe so that you will be sure not to cross-wire your terminals. Otherwise, the wire has clear insulation showing its inner copper core."
3972,"This is the second time I've purchased this brand of speaker wire. The first time was about five years ago when I replaced my surround sound wiring in my big room. It really enhanced the sound as the original wiring was the cheapo stuff. This recent purchase was for my son's surround sound and without fail, the sound is incredible. This brand of wire is top shelf!"
3973,"It's copper wire, works as intended. A little expensive for what it is, but way cheaper than Monster wire or some other &#34;fashion&#34; names...As a side note- you can buy from a home improvement store 14AWG wires(2 colors) and use for the same purpose, will be cheaper in a long run and surely better conductor"
3974,I'm using this for my home theater and computer.It has all the connections I need and I love the 10' cord.
3975,"The only thing I would add not included elsewhere is that they use a 3.5 mm connector. Not the best performing (seeKlipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black)), but the best buy."
3976,The Sima lens cap keepers are the only ones that I have found that are worth buying. There are a couple of other brands that are usually cheaper but I have had bad luck with all of them. These actually work and they aren't all that much more expensive than the really cheap ones. Use the Sima brand.
3977,"It was time to replace an old worn out mouse that I was constantly cleaning.  I did not have much room to move the mouse due to the set up of my desk, so I decided to give a trackball a try.  This was the smallest trackball that I found and fits very nicely next to my keyboard.  It did not take long to get used to using the trackball, and I will not be going back to a mouse."
3978,"This is the first cable modem I have ever purchased, I used to just rent mine from the cable company. This is way better, it's way faster and way more stable then the old one's they gave us.Linksys makes good products and it's definately work the buy."
3979,"I use my Mac full-time to make a living and when ever I get a new Mac Company K, I try to use the mouse that comes with it.  But the Apple mouses only last about six months while the Microsoft Mouses last about two years.  The Apple mouse has a shape and pressure points that cause my finger tendons to get sore.The Apple Mighty Mouse has the same shape as the previous Apple mouse designs that caused soreness in my hand.Four years ago, I started using the Microsoft Intellimouse Optical Mouse.  It fits just right in my hand and keeps my hand from getting sore and uncomfortable.I used to get the Intellimouse for $15.00, new, but it is in demand these days and it is hard to get one for under $30.00, after shipping costs are added.I still go with the Microsoft Intellimouse, for my Mac desktop and Mac laptop, when ever is is time to get a new mouse."
3980,"These connectors are a SUPERB solution. The wire (whether thin gauge ""zip wire"" or thick Monster Cable wire) is splayed out in this connector and locked in securely via a screw in fastener. The banana tip then feeds into the amp's banana socket with a minimum of fuss and ensures a low-impedance connection. The plugs themselves are very rugged and make a solid, reliable contact. You shouldn't ever have to mess with them again.If you have a 6.1 system, you need three packs of these for the amp-side connection. Placed on high quality speaker wire, these connectors are a permanent solution. But don't worry, if you upgrade your speaker wire later, these connectors come off in a jiffy. Worth the price!"
3981,"Amazingly powerful set of speakers, this thing gets loud, and I mean loud. When you come home late at night and want to listen to some good music while chatting on-line and annoying the neighbors, these speakers are the best. When you want surround sound--can't beat them. If you want to hear you enemy creep up behind you--these babies will serve you well. With a 5.1 surround audio card and (maybe) some extension coord these speakers create the perfect audio environment for computer sound. The box these things are packed in is HUGE. When i lifted it I would swear it weight about 70 pounds, but that's mainly because it is so...boxy. The sub is the heaviest thing in the package, and also the largest, about the size of my computer tower. When you pick it up, you know you have some good quality inside that...sub. The setup is extremely easy, and the remoute is more than handy, although I figured out how to switch the power between the front and rear speakers only after I had to return my package because the sub died. I was so happy when it came back! People, buy these speakers, be smart, get youself some greaat sound at a low (for this system) price."
3982,"This is my third digital camera with each buy being a step up. This is a great camera that takes great pictures. Some of the great features are the manual controls like focusing and lighting. Another big plus is the Nightframing mode which allows you to use infra red to view and focus on your subject in total darkness and then the flash pops up as you take the picture for a perfect color shot. The Nightshot mode is also pretty neat if you want to take pictures in the dark with infra red like results.Overall this is a great camera with only one negative comment and that being on the red eye reduction feature. Once you press the shutter button you no longer see your subject through the viewfinder/LCD screen because it goes blank for the second or so while the red eye strobing occurs. If you're not careful, this can result in your moving the camera off of the subject during the strobing... or your subject themselves decided to move and you won't know that until after the picture is taken and the viewfinder/LCD picture comes back.I recommend this camera to anyone wanting a great 5M pixel camera at a very reasonable price (compared to others) with exceptional features."
3983,"Apparently, all you have to do is wait a few years and you can get all the benefits that are due to ""those who wait"" when shopping for elecronics equipment! Right now, I am the proud new owner of a great little DVD player that, while lacking a carousel for multiple discs, has most of the features DVD users want and need for a LOT less than $100! Stereo, scene jumping, compatibility all across the disc spectrum, (it can play MP3s and ordinary CDs too!) I defy any other manufacturer to come up with a model that offers so much for so little.NOWHERE are any shortcuts visible, except in the fact that it's not a changer. The construction is decent, the performance is faultless and you'd expect to find the DVD specific features on something costing at LEAST fifty to a hundred bucks more!I'll get back to you on the long term, but for now...NICE GOING, TOSHIBA!!"
3984,I had this lense on my new Canon XSi and took it to bermuda.The lense is pretty fast. Picture came out great and clear even know it doesnt have IS (image stabalize). A little big and heavy but image quality was real nice.
3985,"More than 10 years ago I invested in a Palm 505.  It recently died and I was lucky to be able to replace it with the PalmOne m515 color.  What do I do with it?  I carry it with me when I travel for playing Scrabble and other games.  A ""color"" Palm works best for some game features like for viewing the actual Scrabble Board as it is seen in reality, with the colored tile squares.  The Palm is small and works nicely.  After having it, I became aware that it can also be used for an address/phone book and that it interfaces with the computer via its own computer program so one can synch computer entries with the Palm OR one can make changes to the Palm Info then synch that info with the computer info.  This is a wonderful tool!  One does not need a telephone or have to pay a monthly fee or ""be connected"" to use this gadget.  It is wonderful!  Just buy a Palm, store info.  One can also buy a Palm keyboard and input info via a version of Palm Word, then too, synch the info with the computer, meaning, update computer info to be the same as the Palm or vice-versa.  Journal while traveling via the Palm and keyboard, then synch it with the computer when returning home.  GREAT!  I was so thrilled to be able to still buy a replacement.  The replacement Palm m515 works great and uses the same Scrabble SD card that I purchased for the first Palm.  BUY a Palm!  I hope there will always be something of this nature available."
3986,"I bought this Legacy 8"" woofer to replace the driver in a 10+ year old Infinity powered sub that I picked up second hand (8"" 4ohm).  The sub was bad, but we didn't know if it was the driver or the amp, so we decided to pick up this low cost driver as a test.After a week of listening, I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.  It produces deep strong bass, much better than I expected at this price point.  This will work great attached to the soundbar in our bedroom."
3987,"The good:The sound is simply amazing for a $150 system with small speakers! It's among the best sound I have heard by far. By saying this I should say I am not an audiophile and do not have a high-end compoent sound system to compare w/. (Please see my updates in my review for Logitech Z-2300)The bad:The design and build quality looks a little bit cheap. A MAJOR DRAW-BACK: Too many wires are coming in and out of the sub and one of the sat speakers. These speakers are wall mountable (w optional brackets which I bought from Klipsch's website). But the problem is that if you mount them on a wall, they look urgly with 3 or 4 wires coming out of a sat speaker and it is very inconvienent if not impossible for you to reach the volume control which is located on a sat speaker.Suggestions to Klipsch:Put all the controls on the FRONT pannel of the sub cause the sub is ususally left on the ground and easily accessable. By doing this, there is only one wire going to each of the sat speakers making the system  more acceptable to those neat-looking people including me. Personally I do not like the idea of adding a control console because this will mean more wires are used."
3988,"These are by far the best sounding three-piece PC speakers you can buy today, buy without hesitation - you will not be disappointed."
3989,"I have owned one of these for about 5 years, and have had no issues with it. They have enough plug ins to fill my needs. The only thing is, depending on where you will put it, the LED's can be a bit bright. I solved this by putting a strip of blue painters tape along the top, which 'dims' down the LED's enough not to be a bother. All in all a great piower strip for the price!"
3990,It's exactly what I needed and the quality is good. I use this adapter to hook up the sub in my game room system and get a snug fit and a clean signal.
3991,"Using this in a Jeep Wrangler.  Decided to not have it screwed down in favor of using ties, in case of bad weather it can be removed, and it sounds and works great."
3992,"Looks professional, low/slim profile, functions as expected.  I haven't had a failure after many hours of use (I've had sometime before providing my review."
3993,"I have been using these keyboards for years in my high production transcription business.  I find the laptop or standard rectangular keyboards too &#34;crunched&#34;.  This keyboard has been my go to one for over a decade and I have NO signs or symptoms of carpal tunnel, in spite of hours and hours a day of typing.  Many fear they will not &#34;get the hang&#34; of it.  It took me a day to get used to it, and I have never looked back.  I do recommend that once you start with an ergo board that you try to buy only the same model, so the placement of the keys never changes from what your hand/brain are conditioned to expect.  However, saying that, it wouldn't take long to readjust."
3994,"This is a sleek little thing for the $13 I paid for it. I had absolutely no problem with the power issue that others have mentioned. I was able to connect a digital camera, as well as a USB 128 MB Flash memory from PNY technologies quite easily. My Windows ME laptop picked it both the items up rightaway, and both the items showed up as separate ""drives"" under ""My Computer"". I did not need any separate 'power adapter'. Despite the warnings about the power issue, I took a $13 risk, and it paid off!"
3995,"Excellent headphone overall. Only complain I have is with comfort but having used other similarly priced headphone, I realize that comfort comes at significant price.Sound quality is very good. Many of headphone at this price range has flat sound with exaggerated bass. But HD202 has very balanced sound. Decent accent on the bass but not overwhelming. High treble is there and decent mid-range. But it doesn't have that cheesy punch that other similar priced headphone may have. And that is a good thing for me.Headphone is not comfortable. Its heats up on the ear and creates pressure spot like most other low end headphones. But the remedy for that seems to be 100+ headphones. Especially with my eye glasses I have difficult time wearing it for more than an hour. Question to ask is if you wear headphone for more than an hour. I usually don't. But if you do time to pay for comfort.Build quality is pretty good. Cord is not the thinnest even though it is not thick. It should hold up for few years. 10 feet long cord is definitely a plus. I do not like short cords that pulls on the device or unplug itself. 10 feet is a very respectable length. So it is good for your receiver, your pc. But when you are mobile, it includes a cable wrapper that can shrink the length. It is a bulky plastic but you didn't pay extra for that so can't complain. Plastic feel is okay the padding is very thin and light substance that I am sure will flake off and britle away in matter of few months. Oh well, it's what I paid for. Overall for what you paid it is very well built headphone. HD201 is really cheesy. and I have used cheapest Philip that just broke a part. So this is pretty good.Sound leak. Someone mentioned. It is pretty loud. I got good volume on my iPad. And if I was at library I will check on my leakage but when the can is seal on to your ear, leak isn't that bad but when it is not it is pretty loud. But little bit of volume control should fix it. If you are knucklehead who love to blast your own ear off, you probably won't be buying this.I don't look good on this. My biggest problem. I will probably get another one. Open one with around the ear design. But it is good to have a cheap decent headphone rolling around.==After using for a month, headphone is a bit more comfortable. I can wear it for 2-3 hours even though the hot spot is still there. It doesn't have as much of a pressure spot as before for some reason. Sounds great. Not much bass to speak of though."
3996,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fan of the Koss KTXPro1 headphones, so much of what I write is in comparison.My pair of headphones at home were recently broken and I went to buy another pair, and asked my kids if they needed headphones. My son wanted a pair like I had, so he was getting the Koss headphones, and my daughter wanted ear-enclosing headphones, so after a little Company A searching and filtering, I came across the Sennheiser HD 202s. For about $6 more, not a big deal. I'd finally get to hear these famous Sennheisers!I prefer the non-enclosed form factor of the KTXPro1, so I can hear what else is going on around me (phone ringing, doorbell, kids yelling, etc). I was going to try the Sennheiser PX 100s, but they're a little pricey in comparison. I was going to offer my daughter the Koss UR40s but they apparently let the sound out for the world to hear, which we didn't want, and the Koss Pro4AATs were too expensive. It seems that these 2 were the best choices from these companies for what we were looking for.They arrived, and they were compared on an iPod classic. Who knew that there was so much sound hiding in that iPod?! We definitely addressed the weak link for personal music listening. I haven't tried those soft-foam inside-the-ear-canal earbuds yet, but they have a tough act to follow.Both sets sounded great, but I have to give the Sennheisers the edge. There was a little more detail coming out of the music, but in my opinion gave up a little bit of bass. It would probably be very hard to tell without back-to-back comparisons. I think that the HD 202s gain a little more detail than they lose in bass compared to the KTXPro1s.The HD 202s are _just_ big enough to tuck my ears inside without too much discomfort, and they fit over my glasses. I can see that comfort could be an issue for larger heads, but luckily not for me. The HD 202s have a thicker wire, so may be more durable. The KTXPro1s have an inline volume control, but in my case, I rarely if ever use it, since the audio source is generally close at hand.Among the headphones I've tried and looked at, if I were to sit back, shut out he world, and hear what I wanted to hear, I'd go with the Sennheiser HD 202s. If I wanted to hear the best sound that I could get and still hear what's going on around me, I'm sticking with the Koss KTXPro1s and giving up a _very small_ bit of sound quality. If I want to get ""high fidelity"" headphones that will fit in my pocket, I have my eye on the Koss KSC75s, which look like they're clip-on KTXPro1s. I may one day try the Jbuds J2 or J3 earbuds to see if it's possible to get good sound out of such a small package.I'm never going to spend a lot of money on headphones, but these are far beyond the earbuds or the like that come with an iPod, smartphone, MP3 player, etc. Not that they can't be good, but so far I haven't seen a pair that are really up to the task of being used primarily for music. For smartphone sets, which include a microphone, the Palm Treo/Pre headphones with chrome and magnets aren't too shabby! I'm going to try the JVC Gumy HA-F140 as cheap replacement headphones for trips where I don't mind them getting lost.In summary, for less than $25, try one of these larger headsets if you haven't already. IMHO, it's a very big improvement.Not to pick on Dr. Dre, but I can't imagine what the Beats high-definition headphones can offer at _10 times_ the price over these. I hope that I'm not blessed (or is it cursed?) with eardrums that can tell the difference. I can't afford it!"
3997,"To be sure I'm no audiophile. In the past I've only been casually interested in listening to music. I bought these because I wanted headphones to shut out the noise while listening to music and audio books while traveling. Was I ever in for a surprise when I plugged them into my pc.  Using them with my pc immediately exposed all the flaws of my sound card.  So I upgraded that to one of the new soundblaster 24 bit cards. Not to be overly dramatic, for me the resulting sound has been life changing. The sound (amplified by an average quality amplifier) is much, better than anything I have ever owned. I've even started listening to some classical music, music that I never had much appreciation for before.By the way, I've had the 280's a few months now and they seem to be very sturdy. Also yes they do improve after breaking in.time passes......the head strap has considerably cracked with pieces of the plastic falling out.  I wrapped electrical tape around the cracked areas so it doesn't look too bad and still works fine.  These are now my work headphones.  The isolation works both ways, I can crank up the volume without disturbing my co-workers.At home I've upgraded to Sennheiser HD 595's using a usb HeadRoom Total Bithead headphone amplifier with my pc which doesn't use the pc's soundcard.  This rig sounds noticeably better but you give up the sound isolation of the 380's.One other thing, be sure and install the Izotope Ozone free plug in for  winamp.  It noticeably improves the sound of your music."
3998,"Ok, so I just realized I've had these headphones for almost 3 years now! Truly now I can say that these are simply fantastic.Like people say, they are snug-fitting. These are over-the-ear headphones and in order to keep the sound out, they gotta be tight fitting. I've had ZERO issues with my head hurting. They feel really comfortably snug. I have had ZERO problems with the headband cracking (maybe they changed the materials int he newer models).In terms of noise reduction, these cans are really fantastic. Sure they don't stop it all but they do a great job of significantly reducing outside noise and while letting you enjoy the music without the changes that occur from active reduction headphones. I use these when I mow the lawn and at 30dB rated reduction they are really awesome. Sure they get hot and sweaty (just like ear muffs) but hey, the music is great. And as someone else said, they are great for plane rides because, oh wow, do they make those movies enjoyable and that screaming baby 3 rows back pleasantly muffled. =)Sound quality is amazing compared to any other cheap crap you've listened to. Sure they're not as good as the higher end Sennheiser or Grado cans, but they sure hold their ground for their amazing price. They'll easily beat all the others once you have a loud talker in the room next to you.I'll note that it's worth looking at the graphs supplied by HeadRoom when you are in the market for getting some headphones. [...].But really folks. As a multi-year owner of these headphones I have ZERO complaints. These are simply a fantastic pair of cans at a great price. Countless friends of mine have bought their own. My only warning, make sure your cellphone ringer is set to LOUD so you can hear it ring (or the doorbell for that matter) when you are listening to your music. =D"
3999,"Bought this for my son for Xmas 2012. Since it is now June 2013, a review is in order.In short, my college student son, an accomplished musician, continues to rave about the sound quality and durability 6 months after receiving this for a gift.GOAL!"
4000,"This universal remote is simple to setup and works great.  It is easy to program devices and setup in our crazy electronics world we live in.  I previously owned a more expensive Harmony remote which broke down over time recharging.  This remote simply needs batteries when it runs out and that took a long time to reach.  I have a Tivo and this remote allows me to do everything with my Tivo that I used it for.This is one of the best kept secrets.  So many electronic reviewers marvel at the Harmony remotes, but they do not work nearly as well as this unit.  The MX 500 is perfect for me and I could not be happier."
4001,"We are going to Peru soon, and both my wife and I are learning Spanish.This gives really rich sound and clear.We highly recommend this for all!!"
4002,Coupled this with a Fotodiox lens mount adapter to connect my Nikon D40 to my Celestron telescope.  Have been taking awesome pictures of various planets and the moon with this set up.  Definitely enjoy!
4003,"The most important features to you should guide your decision in the complex hand held GPS market.  Sometimes new technology replaces features that I personally find essential and kick myself when the product is discontinued. My needs for a GPS was portability between two vehicles and sport boats as well as portability off the trail.  Being able to replace batteries is critical rather than being out of luck with no charger available. That ruled out the Quest series for me.  Color is nice, but consumes power. Waterproof is critical. Design with ergonomics of the GPS V is great in that the screen can be oriented portrait or landscape. Mounting in the vehicle or boat is perfect for my needs and on hikes the belt holder is nice. Living in the Northeast I was able to load detailed maps of the areas I travel 90% of the time and have plenty of additional space for planning road trips. Despite the fact that there are many nice features on the new units, for my personal purposes, there was no other unit than the GPS V that combined the features I desired."
4004,"as others have said, the price is steep. But, from the side in certain light settings, people think I'm looking at a blank screen. I treasure my privacy, and really hate when people snoop in on my email, and other personal information. For me, it's worth it."
4005,"I love these little battery packs. I have two of them. Charge up all 32 batteries and you can flash away or use in your camera for a long time.  These packs are compact and fit inside my camera backpack, or fit right into one of the outside sleeves."
4006,Good for transferring sound from your tv to surround sound it works very well I like it very much it works
4007,Great for someone who wants to hook up their computer to a tv or some audio system. Still use it today.
4008,Good audio clarity.  Wire seems sturdy.  I have been using this for 3 years now without issue.  My kids us this for the Ipad.
4009,Worked well.  I bought it so my husband and I could share the same Android tablet in the airport and airplane.  The sound was good.
4010,"Bought the Belkin F8V234-WHT Speaker and Headphone Splitter on 8/19/2010 for $[...] (Super Saver Shipping) from Company A; shipped USPS Priority Mail 8/23/10, and I received it 8/26/10.  Great turn-around on delivery from ordering - 1 week! Splitter works just great on our iPod and on our Sansa Fuze.  Maintains stereo separation between the channels also.  Great deal!"
4011,"I havent see any loss of audio quality with this headphone splitter, I use this with my Bose headphones as well as I have tried in my car. Good quality product. Happy with the purchase."
4012,I use this to run video from my DSLR to my Android tablet while using a camera crane/jib.  It's the perfect length and the thick jacket should last for years.
4013,Good price and great value. High bandwidth cables. Packaged nicely and shipped promptly. High quality cables with nice snag-free connectors.
4014,"What is there to say, wanted some smaller cables to reduce clutter. These cat6 are sturdy and don't feel cheap at all. Very happy with them."
4015,Got my cables today.  Wanted to replace some old Cat 5 (yuck!) and Cat 5e cables.  Need the best for my network.  Bought in many lengths and colors.  Work great and the price is fantastic.  Need a Cat 6 cable in various lengths?  This product does the job!

4018,"Can't have enough charging cables I always say. It's a little short for some applications but for my purposes, it's just right.  Works fine too.  Doesn't have to be expensive and it isn't.P.S.  My review is for a C2G/Cables to Go 27329 USB 2.0A to Mini-B Cable, Black, 1 meter long.  Why my review ended up for a product that looks just like it has an old-fashioned set of antenna connectors on it, I'll never know."
4019,i have made several patch cables ranging from 3 to 5 feet and ran one about 200 feet from the bedroom to the living room and every single cable is perfect. it feels well protected and gets the job done.
4020,"Had cds and DVDs laying around getting scratched. Video games, data files, songs, movies. Doesn't take much to damage the disk. 50 cases for under $10 is fantastic. They even color coded them. Thin cases, easy to store."
4021,"needed a rs232 cable quickly and the price can't be beaten, worked great and I have ordered several again. Even with the prime shipping it was way cheaper then going to a local store a hunting down one there."
4022,I am a low voltage electrician and I have never had any problem with any cable or equipment from Trip Lite. Ever.
4023,I chopped this cable up for a custom installation.  The wires were easy to splice not to thin and flimsy like most cheap cables.
4024,"No complaints. I'm using this cable on this monitor right now and loving it, for the price it was a no brainer! Crisp text, fine color, no problems."
4025,It was nice quality wire for the price! I have no complaints!! Worked great with the wall plate I purchased with it!!
4026,This adapter allowed me to connect the dvi input on an old tv to the hdmi outputs on my cable box. Seems to work fine as tv tells me it is at highest resolution which is 1080i for that particular model. As for construction it feels good and solid.
4027,"These arrived in a cardboard sleeve in a soft gray mailing envelope. I was kind of surprised they weren't all cracked, but they are just fine. These are cheap cases, but they do the trick and they're very inexpensive. When you give a CD to someone, they just burn it to their music collection and then throw the original CD away anyway, so I don't see the point in spending a lot of money on these."
4028,I read the reviews and got the sleeve that was designed to insert discs in. It works and its cheap
4029,Jewel cases. None were cracked or broken. Just as expected. I used them to handout promotional DVDs. I don't know what else there is to say. These are just jewel cases.
4030,I recently bought this right before vacation because I wouldn't have access to download pics from my smaller digital memory card. I stored about 140 HQ pics and didn't run out of room. It was perfect for my vacation trip.
4031,good cheap cable with a quality build.  Does the job perfectly and cannot hear any hum or feedback noise from this cable.
4032,"Hose cables are always a great buy. They are high quality and low noise. If you want durability and not have to pay much, this is a great option. Work great, have no complaints. Cheers!"
4033,This is a quality cable. No static or noise in my PA setup. It should last for a long time.
4034,"long black and flexible, plus it's thick and meatyi really like how long it is, long and black are good"
4035,"Nice cable but on the light weight side. However, might be perfect for someone looking for it to be lightweight.Thanks again to [...] and Company A for the outstanding service and fast shipping !!!!"
4036,"Exactly as pictured.  The insulation is better than I expected.  It's a thick cable with a nice feel in the hand.  Not entirely free of 'cable memory' like true rubber cables, but a step up from the ordinary quality.  Sturdier housing on the ends would be nice, but they have those and they're 10x more expensive, so I'm very happy with this cable for the price."
4037,Have a few of these they come in handy :) good buy
4038,"I bought this to extend some RCA speaker wires with another pair of wires I had lying around. It serves exactly that purpose, and I have not noticed any quality degradation by using these to connect them.I do have to mention though, the picture is misleading. These are actually two separate couplers, although the picture makes it seem like it is on piece. For me, this is no big deal, and actually works better in my opinion, but be aware of that."
4039,This adaptor functions very nicely for what it was intended and so far do not have any issues with using it.
4040,"After living with my Jukebox 3 for about nine months, I'm just now beginning to appreciate its full capabilities.  In addition to listening through headphones, I also purchased the accessory Home Kit which allows me to play through speakers using a remote control, as well as the Car Kit which comes with a cassette adapter and power cord for playing the Jukebox 3 in my car.I've loaded every piece of music I own -- as well as my own custom playlists -- into the Jukebox 3 -- so I can now enjoy all of these everywhere I go.  No more CD's to catalog or change.  No more stations (in my car) to tune.  The Jukebox 3 has even begun to replace my home stereo -- as my music player of choice around the house.To make sure that ambient noise isn't a problem, I also purchased a set of Sennheiser HDC 451 Noise Canceling headphones which work great, both indoors and out.  (Other brands incidentally are junk.)  There almost isn't a place where I can't listen to my Jukebox 3 -- except maybe, of course, underwater.The Creative software is very intuitive.  It will load both WMA (Window Media) and MP3 files with ease.  Transferring songs utilizing the Firewire connection (which I use) is seemingly instantaneous.  And the EAX (music equalizer) settings offer a variety of modes that increase the highs, lows, stereo separation and reverb (echo) to match the type of music, the quality of the speakers, or the acoustics of the room (or car) in which I'll be listening.Before I acquired the Jukebox 3, enjoying my entire music list was often times a challenge.  Today, since any song in my collection is now easily accessible -- my desire for new music has become almost insatiable.  And with its 20 Gb hard drive, so too (it seems) is my Jukebox 3.To utilize my Jukebox 3 more, I've begun to scatter stereo PC speakers around my home and office.  And I've also purchased a set of Sony portable units for use on business trips (in my hotel room).When I originally obtained the Jukebox 3, I never imagined that it would revolutionize the way I listen to music.  I went from a casual listener -- to a super heavy music lover.  I now listen to music everywhere I go -- just the songs I like -- because it's now so easy!  I love it!Other jukeboxes (hard drive MP3 players) will probably sound just as good through headphones.  But when it comes to listening to my tunes at home (through speakers) or in my car -- the Jukebox 3's EAX equalizer settings and the Home Kit's remote control -- make my music sound better and easier to control -- than would be possible with other jukebox brands.I don't mean to sound cornier than I already have, but when it comes to music -- and my Jukebox 3 -- I literally won't leave home without it!  Enjoy."
4041,"This cleans all the fingerprints off our touch screens, and the non-touch screens which we all seem to touch anyway!  I love that it only needs a tiny amount, and there is no smearing at all."
4042,"This is my third CD-MP3 player and my favorite by a long shot. I have also owned a Philips Expanium EXP103 and a Pine D'Music SM200C. This Sony has the fit and finish of the Philips device, but the ID3 tag support of the Pine device.Pros:* Battery life. Sony claims 24 hours. I only use it for 4-6 hours at a time and in doing so I've only depleted 25% of the battery so it seems about right.* FAST startup. It is about 10 seconds from the time you put the CD in to the time it actually starts playing. Usually MP3-CD players with ID3 tag support take much much longer.* Great ID3 tag support. You can view the title, artist, and album information.* Folder navigation (and shows the names of the folders as you are navigating)* Fantastic anti-skip protection. I was unable to get it to skip without doing something that might actually damage the unit. For MP3s it actually reads the current MP3 into memory and stops spinning the CD. For the most part the CD is not spinning when you play MP3s. I assume this is how they get such long battery life.* Good repeat options for CDs and MP3s (on MP3s you can repeat just the current folder)* Intuitive controls* Size: slim and very lightCons:* No ""line out"" jack (not a big deal for me, but it is for some)* No backlight for display* Size: while it is slim it is somewhat longer than the smaller Sony CD Walkmans. It is still smaller than the Philips and Pine players I had.* Sort of cheap looking, especially the bottom of the unit. Since nobody sees the bottom there's no big deal. For me this is a bonus since I spend a lot of time listing in the airport. If it looks cheap nobody will want to steal it. It's not cheaply made, but it doesn't have the ""cool"" factor that some of the other Sony CD Walkman products have."
4043,"I received this product within seven days after order, at an APO address and during the annual Christmas rush.  Speak volumes for Company A.com and Cables to Go.  A good combination of customer service and price.  The cables' timely arrival averted a loss of system usage between computers and Smart Boards at our school.  Indeed, the teachers had nothing but high praise for our quick response and materials acquisition.  This is all thanks to Cables to Go and Company A.com."
4044,"This item is very useful to me.  I leave it connected.  This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase.  I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it.  Thank you so much Company A.com for the great price,  good value and prompt delivery.  I use this item frequently."
4045,I bought this router from Company A and selected Super Saver Shipping. It arrived in only 3 days. The router was very easy to install using its web GUI and setup wizard. It also includes a firewall and now I can block ping requests coming in from the WAN interface whereas my Westell DSL modem couldn't do that. The Linksys EtherFast PCMCIA ethernet card on my KNOPPIX linux laptop couldn't talk to my 4-port Linksys switch (might be due to an auto-sensing problem) but it works perfectly with this router. This router has plenty of features for a very reasonable price.
4046,"This USB hub is excellent, it works as expected. No extra drivers needed, looks good. Enough number of USB ports... I bought two of this, happy :-)."
4047,Hands-down the best looking USB hub I've seen. Everything has worked as expected and the fast charging ports do respond to charging cell phones.
4048,Easily installed and nicely positioned on top of my Midnight tower pc.  This hub provides easy access to USB ports without having to hassle with the back of the pc unit.  Works as advertised.
4049,I connected this at the end of a 65' USB extension cable and it works great.  The bonus is a 2.0 Amp charging port for Smart Device fact charging.
4050,It is a USB hub so there isn't much to talk about.  It works like it should and I haven't had any issues with it.  Good device for the price.
4051,"We have Polycom phones and were buying a cheaper version on this cable, however, Polycom decided to change something in their architecture. After hours on the phone with many incompetent people at Polycom support we finally found the problem. We needed this cable in stead of the cheaper one. We will buy these from now on..."
4052,Perfect for offering protection for the electrical items located in my central A/C unit located out of site and out of mind.  Electrical damage to the unit would be costly so this low cost protection is comforting to me.
4053,Bought new HDTV for my mom and wanted a surge protector for her TV. A friend suggested this and checked it out and bought. Great little product for simply protecting her new TV. Will buy again for any of my needs.
4054,"I plug it in, I plug more things in, they turn on.  That's really all I wanted.  I like the side outlets too."
4055,I only have one issue. I can't keep them around. People keep taking them for various things and they don't come back.
4056,"Needed a Parallel port for some legacy equipment at work.  Could have replace the connection for $250/each, but bought this card for much less.  Installed card and software and it has work flawless for over a year now."
4057,I installed one of these a few weeks ago on my computer which runs 24/7 and I can clearly see quite a bit of dust it has captured. Well worth the money for a sloth like me who hates to clean out the dust bunnies from my computer case. One note on my case I had to trim the removable side where it bends around the back because the filter housing has a slightly larger footprint than the case fan and was interfering with the covers fit. I used a sheet metal nibbler to trim off the metal that was hitting the filter and was good to go
4058,"I bought this for several reasons, and it succeeds on all counts.First, I need a flat plug since this is behind our bed. I have a sideways/flat plug for my wife's surge protector, and this one goes straight down. So both fit nicely and the bed can be (almost) flush against the wall.Next, I wanted good spacing on the plugs to accommodate wall warts. I have my cell phone charger next to the bed, and sometimes plug in other stuff. Most of the plugs on this device are sufficiently separated that device plugs don't interfere with each other.Finally, I wanted something with a moderately short cord. Six feet is not short, but most of the flat-plug surge protectors I found had longer cords. This needs to go a whopping one foot, so the less slack the better. You will be hard pressed to find a shorter cord than six feet without going into the realm of &#34;I would be scared to plug in anything more expensive than an alarm clock&#34; surge protectors.If I find myself needing another surge protector, I would strongly consider purchasing another one of these."
4059,"I love it.  I have other external floppy disk drives (yeah, I'm still using floppy disks) and this one is the quietest and fastest one I have."
4060,"This switch is as advertised.  It works out of the box, without any problems, setups, uplink switches, or anything else.  Just plug and play.Silent, fan-less operation.  However, it does get a bit warm to the touch.  If fully loaded (using all ports at high volumes of traffic) and running in warmer room, overheating may become an issue.  Even so, I'll take that possibility over yet another noisy fan in my office."
4061,"Over the past couple years I've had both my garage door openers fail because of some type of line surge that I still haven't figured out. I decided to buy these surge protectors to save me as I try and resolve this issue. Last week I had another sure and found 1 of these surge protectors with burn marks coming out of the outlet. I checked the outlet and there was still power, I checked the garage door opener and it still worked, but my surge protector was fried - It worked!! So, looks like I'll be a customer of my own recommendation - I'm ordering a replacement."
4062,"This surge protector is well made and very easy to install.  Aside from the protective aspects of the product, it provides more plug in capability for your normal 2 plug wall socket!"
4063,"I have bought and used maybe 100 of these minidiscs over the years, and they have not failed yet (unlike Memorex discs!).The ""Shock Absorbing Mechanism"" actually works(to a small degree). I happen to like the red, green, blue and purple colors, though I really have no use for them.  I know some people who use the colors for categorization.  I don't want to know what they use the purple ones for, though.Sony is exagerating when they claim ""highest level of performance"" ... that would be HHB brand discs at three times the price.  If you are a pro making once-in-a-lifetime recordings, you probably use HHBs already.  The Sony minidiscs are perfectly fine for the rest of us."
4064,"Pros: excellent pictures/colors, light, easy to use (point & shoot), very good PC software, and much better priced compare with other 3.x Mega Pixels.Cons: plastic body, shuttle lag.I recommended this nice toy to all of my relatives and friends. We all love the outcome of pics."
4065,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this antenna for my VBox USB HDTV Tuner. I received the product yesterday and tested it rightaway. I am living at a Chicago suburbs, about 18 miles from the nearest broadcast station. This model is just perfect. I am getting a 100% signal strength from all the available UHF DTV stations in Chicago.16 Feb 2006 (update)I've been using my antenna for almost a week now and I am really happy with it. A word for those who are not getting good reception even within 10 miles: This is a UHF antenna. Make sure that you are focusing on UHF channels and not VHF. I live around 18 miles from the nearest broadcast tower and I am getting a 100% signal strength on all the UHF channels."
4066,I purchased these compact binoculars immediately prior to an Alaskan vacation because I wanted a good pair that was convenient to carry and use.  The Nikon Travelite V 9x25 binocular served that role beautifully.  It was great to wear the case attached to my trouser belt and handy for use in all situations.  It is as good as a larger pair of older binoculars I have and Nikon makes a quality product!  I would recommend this binocular to anyone needing a compact pair. Totally satisfied with this product.
4067,"This is a nice keyboard. I believe it is the most inexpensive Logitech model.  The good news is that Logitech doesn't make junk.  It's slightly tweaked from a standard keyboard, in that keyboard is not inclined upward but horizontal.  There is a also a plastic wrist-rest that attaches to the front of the keyboard.  These changes I believe are supposed to make typing more comfortable since your wrists are no longer twisted upwards.  I am experimenting using the keyboard with and without the wrist-rest; I think it largely depends on the height of the chair you are sitting in--if your chair is high enough, then the wrist-rest is good, if your chair is lower, the wrist-rest leaves your wrists uncomfortably high.  There are some other slight differences in the keyboard; the 1st row of keys (spacebar, control, alt, etc.) are tapered toward the front of the keyboard, I assume for ergonomic reasons.  I like the feel of the keyboard; it requires only a light touch.  It is also fairly quiet i.e. no loud clicking.  The only things I don't like are minor--the function keys must be enabled using a F-lock key--however they stayed locked for the remainder of the time the computer is on.  I also couldn't get the software to work--the one that is supposed to map various keys to things like e-mail, your internet home page, etc.  I don't really care about that, so I didn't really try very hard to get it to work--it probably would have if I persisted.  I also had some problems de-installing the drivers--when I removed them, the keyboard wouldn't work.  I had to reinstall the drivers again.  The keyboard worked OK in Debian Linux (Sarge/3.1), as well as Windows.  The keyboard looks attractive enough, although the wrist-rest if charcoal and the keyboard off-white so they don't match.  In all, an excellent keyboard for the price."
4068,For the price there is nothing better.  Hoya is great and these are quality filters.
4069,Instructions easy to follow. The product is strong and well made and does what it is built to do.
4070,"Got this as a gift for my Dad who is a musician who needs this to record his live stuff.  He was ecstatic with it, and he used to work in film and tv.  He thought it cost way more than it did on quality alone.  That should tell you all you need to know."
4071,The Power Strip arrived today (26 Oct 2011).  I plugged it in and no problems are all.  the cord is long enough to go around my space so no one can trip.  Great Power Strip.
4072,simple tool for a simple job. it works just fine and I'm happy with it. Simple install. nothing else to report
4073,
4074,Our computers at work ran very slowly because they only had 512mb of RAM. I upgraded them to 2gb and they are much faster now.
4075,"It is not very cheap. True. But by far the best mouse I've had.The addition of useful but not overwhelming buttons make it a supreme tool.The kick is how well it performs as a remote tool and how smooth the motion is. I usually don't buy pricey products, but a mouse is like a shoe. You have to have the most comfortable and preferably sharp one. The charging cradle is very efficient and full charge takes minutes even if the mouse was not returned to the cradle for a day or two.Pros:+Extremely ergonomic+Extra buttons (the back/forward buttons for web-browsing rule!!)+Smooth movement/response+Prfect communication with the remote base+Ultra fast charging (indeed never got it drained)Cons:-Not the cheapest.Good day!"
4076,"This are great speakers. Bose keeps delivering reasonabably priced products in the market. ALthough I dont think these were meant for music specificly, they work great for sorround speakers and make a great compliment to the Acoustimas 7 system since they can be hooked up directly to the rear and fx channels from my amp.Lot of people rag and complain about Bose but I am very eagered to purchase from them again. Klipsch and Bose are great companies with decently priced equipment."
4077,"If you use this lens and get bad images, well it's your fault.  By the way, it's only one aspherical element off of an L lens."
4078,"Purchased this used for $450 and am VERY impressed with it. It only has 4.2MP which is fine because if I ever need images above 2464 x 1648 I can just use interpolation. This is a very solid body, I love the 8fps, and for a 10 year old camera this still blows away the Canon rebel series. I also own a T2i which is great for the video, high iso, & high MP but the build quality of the 1D is far superior as well as the fps, & af points.I highly recommend this, or if you have some extra cash then get the mark ii"
4079,"This is a fantastic piece of technology and I really like it.If you think about it, there really are only 4 ways to exchange technology between computers (for the average person).You could use a floppy drive -but they are not standard anymore on next generation computers, and they only hold 1 megabyte of infomation -hardly enough to handle more than a picture or two.Or, you could use a Zip drive.  But here's the problem.  You now have 100, 250, and 750 megabyte drives, and though you can read any of the older zip disks with a newer drive, you CANNOT WRITE ON THEM (and the reading process is REALLY slow).  I made this mistake, and I am stuck with a 750 Megabyte drive that no one else has, so I can't do much more than backup my own data.Or, you can burn information to a CD-rom and move it that way.  Yes, you can do this, IF you have a burner and a blank cd on the computer you need data from, but that very likely may not be an answer either for casual transfers.Amd finally, what I had been using most of the time, email.  You can realistically email up to 3-5 MB of pictures or files.  Pretty easy to use, and everyone has it, but not a solution for photos or large files.This is where the jumpdrive comes in -and I think it is the perfect replacement.  It is the size of your little finger and (this version) holds 128 MB!  Best of all, the price is VERY reasonable at the moment.Here's how it works.  You pull of the cap and plug the drive directly into your comuter's USB port.  (You don't need any software or drivers to preload -you just plug it in to any computer.)  When it is plugged in the computer automatically recognizes it as a new drive right on your desktop.  I.e. Go to your ""My Computer"" section and it now shows up as ""Lexar Media (H:)""  You then treat it like you would any other drive -you can save files to it, or you can just drag and drop files to it.Here's another cool thing about the Lexar version of this drive.  There is a little green light on the memory stick that lights up and blinks when it is first plugging in, and also when it is loading data.  This will prevent you from removing the stick before the data is loaded -which is usually something that happens very quick!I am very happy with this portable drive.  It is something that is effortless to use, and is small enough that it can basically hang on your keychain so you have it wherever you need it.  (In fact, there is actually a hook on the top of the drive so you can clip or hook it to whatever you want.)Finally, it is something that I can feel confident that even non-techies will be able to use with ease -in other words, this is what mom and dad get for Christmas!"
4080,"Fit perfectly on my 18-55 lens love it,A friend of mines lost my old one very good price for a very well needed cap."
4081,"I just purchased this radio for my home office so I could listen to the radio while I'm working on my computer.  I'm very impressed by the number of stations I can get.  The sound quality is good, and there's even a high/low tone switch which emphasizes either bass or treble, depending on your preference.I get a lot of TV and radio stations and there is a tuning LED which helps you easily tune in stations.  Although the tuning isn't digital, it still works very well.Additionally, the radio has a nice size and weight to it, which leads me to believe that it would be pretty solid and reliable for many years to come.I'm sure there are better radios out there, but for under $30, this might be the best value out there."
4082,"I recently purchased Ooma internet phone service from Company A and needed a router to split my Comcast cable service so I can connect the Ooma. Last week after receiving the TrendNet router, I connected the ethernet wire from the Comcast cable modem to the TrendNet router. After that, I plugged in my computer and Ooma to the router then turned on the power. Everything worked great and still does today. The TrendNet 4-Port broadband router for your Comcast cable is plug and play and no installation of software on your computer is necessary."
4083,"Been using Tripp Lite surge protectors for over 20 years. They've worked well, so no reason to change manufacturer now. If you care enough about your electronics to use a surge protector, you can trust Tripp Lite."
4084,"This is my second ICF-7600GR. What a great radio. Sony started their career making radio's and their engineering team is second to none.The build quality, fit, finish and most of all the sensitivity of the radio couple with their Synchronous detection works like a charm.Every other manufacturer out there is basically copying SONY design and function.Its a shame they are not making their other coveted models anymore, but this might be their last. So grab one without hesitating and you will be happy you got it.No one in the review mentioned this, but i am going to. The antenna seemed to be a little loose. So i thought it was defective and returned it. Got another unit and it was the same. Upon closer inspection, i found that its not loose, the base just extends a bit so you can point the antenna vertically, when the radio is laid on its back(with a stand). So dont do the same mistake i did by returning it. Its just fine and by design. Of course Company A rocks with their return service etc.I also have a ICOM, Yaesu and other radio gear. But when it comes to portable radio, nothing beats the SONY period. Its sensitivity rivals my much expensive ICOM's and Yaesu's.Update : I just ordered one more for my friend as a gift."
4085,"I seem to have those kind of ears that most ear buds just fall out of - one side or the other always flops out, no matter which manufacturer I try.  Regular headphones always seem to slide off my ears.  It's been a hard life, I tell you.  ;->These headphones - hallelujah! - stay in my ears and sound great.  I have definitely gotten value for my money, and I thank all of you who took the time to write reviews about them, because I bought them based on your recommendations.I find that they're easy to fold and unfold, and very lightweight to wear.  My Zen player happened to come with a black velvet storage bag, so they fit inside there with the player.  But I would think that one of those small plastic ZipLoc bags should also do the job for those of you who don't have a similar item."
4086,"The single axis or rotation is perfect for my 3 section Bogen monopod. It is a lot lighter than the 486RC2, which I originally bought for the monopod. It isn't practical for a tripod due to the limited adjustment possibilities.I searched for a long time for the type of mount I would use on my Canon 40D. I wanted only ONE tripod/monopod mount on my camera, and it would stay there. I chose Bogen, as they are 100% NO COMPROMISE. Now I have the 3 section mono, and the 190 4 section tripod. On the tripod I use the 486RC2-FABULOUS!I am blown away by the quality, and the Bogen equipment continues to surprise me every time I use it (the sure sign of quality). I've had to make no excuses since owning the equipment, and can't reccomend the Bogen line, and the RC2 adapter, enough."
4087,It was easy to install and I am much pleased with its performance.  It may even work better than the original.
4088,"I bought a pair of these about a year ago and love them, so I'm back for another pair to keep in my gym bag.  These are not for high fidelity listening, but for their intended use as a sports headphone, they work great.  While working out or gardening, these do the job while staying on my head and out of the way. They are quite comfortable too."
4089,Works well and doesn't take up too much space in my gadget bag.  It also works well for the small lenses on today's point-n-shoot digital cameras as well as my DSLR.
4090,"This is the way to go! I don't know if I received something extra or what but I think the bristles on this unit ""Nikon"" branded one are a little more nicely trimmed than on the LensPen version. Also mine came with a large LensPen puffer that really puts out the air. Both for about the same price as the LensPen version by itself. Highly recommended."
4091,"This lens pen really does work on my DSLR.  The cloth-like part gets rid of smudges and oily stains while the brush gets rid of dust.  I used it on my camera's LCD screen too.  One downside is that if you rub the cloth part on your skin, it might leave some black smudges on you, but it's no big deal."
4092,Carry this at all times;  you don't want to wipe your lense with anything that may scratch it and if you don't have this with you  that's exactly what will happen.
4093,Made installing aftermarket system in my '02 F150 a breeze. Nice to have the little storage pocket (can be mounted up or down).
4094,"First, let me say that the only thing I have to compare this to is my JVC TH-V70 Theater System center speaker.  With that being said, I think this speaker sounds great.  I have it hooked up to my Pioneer VSX-1020-K and the sound is very smooth and detailed.  I'm not really an audiophile, but I'm happy with it!"
4095,"This was another purchase that exceeded my expectations on Company A.com, I received this order very quickly and the quality of the product is great and well as the sound and they are really comfortable.  I would recommend these and for the price you cant find a better deal anywhere!!!!!"
4096,The only bad thing its only good for one pass and the tape is done.  Need a 3 pack or more. ;)
4097,"For such a small radio it gets surprisingly good reception, even the AM band works quite well.. Highly recommended for the price."
4098,This works great with both of my monopods and my DSLR and P&S cameras. About to buy a second. Strongly recommend!!!
4099,I got two of these and have been using them ever since.  Works very well for me.
4100,"Very useful cable management solution.  I wasn't using it on a rack, but the attached plastic piece was removeable (rivits), and I was able to attach the plastic to my TV stand."
4101,"I don't know what the &quot;quality&quot; of this disk is compared to others since it's the only type of disk that my camera will take, but I don't have any complaints about it. What I wanted to mention was that in addition to having the absolute best price, Company A's package also included a card holder that can keep up to 6 of these disks from getting damaged. Thank you!"
4102,"I bought a few sets of these cables for my home theater. I loved the picture they brought to my 50"" plasma tv....however, in pursuit of the perfect picture- I also bought a Monster HDMI cable to upgrade a couple months later. Long story short, these component cables produced a better picture than the hdmi cable at 1/5th the price. These cables produced a sharper picture with more vibrant colors than the hdmi. The wife and friends agreed also. You will be happy with the results you get from these cables."
4103,The unit was plug and play and very easy to install. There have been no problems with it ever since I put it in place. I recommend this switch.
4104,"I bought this switch to expand my Gigabit ports in my office.  There are not many products available with these features for this price point.  Thankfully Netgear made a winner in this product.  It is fast, reliable and was a breeze to setup.  It does exactly what you would expect it to do."
4105,This switch box is working very hard and it does so with ease.  Last one broke down after several years but now our internet lines are super fast.
4106,"If you need a desktop switch with front ports and front indicator lights this is great device.  If you need the cables at the back, and the lights at the front I would recommend the D-Link DGS-1005G 5-Port Gigabit Desktop Switch"
4107,"It only took a minute to plug in all of my computers and a new Infrant terabyte network-attached storage system.  The switch works great and file transfer time is much quicker than when I had everything plugged into a 10Mbit router/switch.  No reading of the manual.Mounting the Netgear underneath a desk with two little screws turned out to be a 20-minute harlequinade with a drill, sweating, cursing, etc.  You need to get the screws spaced exactly right and then back them out of the wood exactly the right amount."
4108,Great add-on for my Directv and BluRay network connection system. I am very pleased with the results of the interaction.Thanks!
4109,The headphones produce amazing sound for the price. Buy them.I really dont have anything better to say about it...
4110,"I bought these headphones to replace an older set. I have them plugged into the headphone jack on my TV. Since my TV remote does not control the volume of this jack the in-line volume control is a necessity. They sound great and fit well. They are ""on the ear"", not over or in the ear which allows me to hear what's going on in the house but doesn't negatively affect my TV listening."
4111,"I have been using these headphones for years and I've owned several pairs. I remember when they used to be in Circuit City retail stores. Koss and RCA have made these headphones. I've owned both brands although I think RCA stopped making them or Koss bought it from them I'm not sure. However these headphones sound great and both brands had the same titanium name and amazing sound. They have amazing stereo sound and rivals headphones 8 times their price. There's a nice mix of highs mids and rich bass. YES I SAID BASS. You'd probably look at these in a store and walk right by them and say, ""those probably sound like crap"". You'd be VERY mistaken. I always keep these in my wish list and if anything happens to the 2 pair I have, I'd order 2 more without thinking twice."
4112,this little thing has been working great for the past year. didn't meed anything fancy and have had zero issues
4113,"I had this old 200MHz MMX notebook from eons ago that was serving a pretty good role as an expensive doorstop. Decided that I wanted to try and use it to stream Internet radio to my stereo - did some minor upgrading, patched it into the network, and everything worked great except that I found out that notebook sound cards don't really seem to be meant to be piped through good stereo systems, as it sounded [bad]. Looked first at the Creative Extigy (sp?) or whatever as a solution, but it seemed like overkill and I read that it was a resource hog, which was no good with this old machine. Saw the original Xitel HiFi-Link, which looked good, but decided to try the Pro to make sure the sound was the best possible. Setup and install took like 2 seconds, it doesn't hog up like any resources at all, and best of all, the sound is really impressive! Good lows, good highs, good sound in general. I would put it equal to, to maybe slightly under CD quality sound, given that the connection now and again makes for the occasional extra noise depending upon the station/connection. I *highly* recommend this if you're trying to stream audio to your stereo and you're pretty picky about sound quality! (btw, am using the analog outs, but have a really good [but older] Yamaha receiver - the Pro also has 2 other types of digital outputs too)"
4114,"No drivers required. Works great on Linux and Ubuntu, Mint, Debian and other Open Source Operating Systems. Good and simple plug and play."
4115,An actual canon back lens cap. Fits my 16-35mm lens perfect that I bought used. Received on Monday after placing order on Saturday. Gotta love Company A prime!
4116,"I'm not an audiophile, I just wanted some nice comfortable headphones for sharing via headphone amplifier for music, computer stuff, and electric instruments. These phones sound great, isolate the outside quite well, are good (not great) build quality, and they are comfortable to wear for 2-3 hours at a time. I quite like the screw on 1/8"" to 1/4"" adaptor. I also have the ATH-M50, the M50 is a better headphone, but not by much. If you are on a budget you won't go wrong with the M30's! At 50 bucks they are a bargain."
4117,"I'm a beginner recording artist, so I needed nice studio monitors! and this seemed like the best choice since there are such great reviews.I record metal/alternative/funk/halloween music and these headphone hit hard with the guitars, drums and bass.I strongly recommend these if you are serious about recording music!:) I love them!"
4118,These headphones are extremely comfortable and the sound is superb for the price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a solid pair of headphones.
4119,"I bought these with a gift card that I got for Christmas. I have several pairs of more expensive ""high end"" headphones from different manufacturers that always seem to end up in use by my wife and kids....So I wanted a pair just for me. The price was reasonable, the reviews good, and I am familiar with the AT brand. They arrived 2 days early and were well packaged. The first thing I noticed when I unpacked them was the outstanding quality of material and craftmanship. Extremely light weight, but not at all flimsy or cheap feeling. The chord is extra long and very well made with stress relief at the plug end. It also came with a screw-on 1/4"" adapter plug. Listening to music is a pleasure, the light weight and padding make them extremely comfortable. The sound, even at low level is clean and crisp. Music, talking, nature sounds, gaming, all give the impression that the sound is not coming from headphones (kind of hard to explain it). These are the best headphones, by far, that I own. For the price, I would argue that you cannot buy a better set of headphones."
4120,"Forget the plastic mount, the plastic construction, the fact that it's not USM, etc...  This little thing is AMAZING!!!  I own the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8, and even though I like the focal length of that lens (and also the fact that it has a constant f2.8 aperture), I always find myself increasing the sharpness of my photos a little bit in post processing.  With the Canon 50mm 1.8 I don't have to do that.  This thing is RAZON SHARP and for $100+ dollars, you can't beat that.I was a little worried (before I bought it) about the focal lenght.  I thought because of the cropped sensor in my Canon T2i, the lens was going to be too close to use in close quarters, or that I would have to stand 50 feet away from my subject, etc...  Boy I was wrong, this lens is just perfect.  GET IT, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED!!!"
4121,"I wanted a fast lens, compared to the ones which I purchased with my Canon 2i, but I wasn't prepared to spend the money for an L series lens.  For my needs, this lens fills the bill.  More &#34;tele&#34; than I would have liked (a 35 mm would have been ideal) but the price was right."
4122,"Most people don't know this:  for every interval you go up on your aperture (f-stop: like  1.4  2.0  2.8  4  5.6  8  11  16  22  which you can find on your camera lens) then your camera requires TWICE AS MUCH light to make the picture.In reverse, when you go DOWN a full stop (from 2.8 to 2.0 for example), your camera needs HALF AS MUCH light to take the photo.Most off the shelf consumer cameras have a lowest setting of 4 or so.  What that means is that THIS lens (at f1/8) requires LESS THAN ONE QUARTER of the light that your stock lens requires to take the same shot!  So... you'll be able to take shots in darker circumstances, and you'll be able to avoid using the flash (which often makes photos look terrible.)The other advantage this lens has is with depth of field.  You know those shots in fancy magazines where only a part of the image is in focus, and the rest is blurry?  This lens makes it so you can take those shots too.  You'll feel like a fancy photographer, I promise.And man is it cheap. And light.  You'll be glad to have this lens in your bag or on your camera."
4123,This is Canon's best kept secret and is a lens that everyone should have in thier bag.  It is a good all around lens for most lighting situations.  I added close-up filters to turn it into a macro lens.
4124,Great glass in a cheap housing makes for prime fun.  I picked this up after several friends recommended adding this to my lens collection.  It's well worth the money and is a great choice for inexpensive (but great) portrait work.
4125,"after reading the reviews, I decided to make this purchase. I am more than pleased. Images are sharp and in very good color. I would recommend highly."
4126,"Using with a Canon Rebel T3I really like this lens. Autofocus is a little noisy, but the pictures look great. If you ever wanted to take those nice looking shots with blurred backgrounds, this is the one for you!If you are used to shooting with the kit lens that comes with a Canon Rebel, zoomed all the way in is 55mm, which will give you an idea of what your pictures will all be framed like with this lens. (It's a prime lens so it does not zoom). You may not want to use this lens shooting in small spaces for that reason if you have a Rebel, but if you can move back this is a fantastic lens. It would be really good for nice portraits, or taking &#34;detail&#34; photos. The f 1.8 not only gives you small depth of field, but it also lets you shoot under lower light conditions. I have used it with some success on the rides at Disney World.There are better lenses in this category, but definitely not for the money. They don't call it the &#34;Nifty Fifty&#34; for nothing."
4127,The Canon Zoom Pack 1000 is a great quality waterproof holster bag for $22.  It's nicely padded  with room for a tele lens.  It has a zipper to entirely close the bag or you can use the velcro for quick access to your SLR.  The shoulder strap is well padded with non-slip material.  It also comes with a built-in waist snap-on strap that can be hidden when using the shoulder strap.The con side to this bag is that it is a bit bulky as compared to the OP/TECH neoprene DSLR case.  And this bag will not fit in a camera bag without taking out most of the padded dividers.
4128,"My compact flash cards fit snugly inside this case.  The case snaps shut and feels fairly secure.  It's about the size of my iPod, so it's not a big bulky thing.  It's not tiny either, but it's small enough to carry in a pocket but solid enough to feel like it's really protecting my cards.  Removing cards is fairly easy."
4129,"This was recommended on a photography website and it is amazing. I use it with my t3i, and even when i have the 70-300mm lens on it still feels great on my neck. The strap that came with my camera was very painful but this one does an excellent job of minimizing the stress on my neck"
4130,I purchased the Sekonic L-358 because of all the great reviews and because I wanted reproducible results. I was using it the first day without the manual. I am now getting into the manual. Great product.
4131,"I bought these because I wanted something cheap that I could run with that wouldn't fall out. Ear buds tend to make my ears sore so I thought I would give these a shot. I have to say I am very impressed. They fit both my ears and my girlfriends very well, and she has small ears. My ears don't get sore at all with these even when wearing them for extended periods of time. I have never had a problem with these falling out, and have even accidentally yanked on the cord while running and they still did not fall off. As an added bonus, if you don't turn them up to loud you can still hear sounds around you while listening to your music, offering a much safer running experience. I use them with my iPhone and have been able to talk on the phone using these headphones, not sure if they have a microphone or not, but it works and the sound is clear on the other end."
4132,These are the most comfortable headphones ever. They stay on your ears always. and unlike those round bud ones they arent a pain to have in your ear. these are good for working out. go sony
4133,A definite must item for any camera lens. Don't take the chance of scratching your expensive lens. No flare ups. Pricey but I'd rather go with this than one of the cheapies out there that can have multiple issues.
4134,"I love this thing! With this thing, I don't always have to be the one stuck behind the camera. I've bought two of these. My first one broke just recently because I dropped it a lot. It's a great product that not only lets the photographer join in the picture, but it also helps you get sharp photos. When you use the remote, you don't press the shutter, so you shake the camera less and the photos are sharper. It's also cheap! Because of this, I recommend you get this if you have any of the compatible Nikon cameras."
4135,"This inexpensive infrared remote controller is a must have because you never know what situations you want to shoot a picture of. It's so small, you better immediately attach it to your Nikon strap so that it cannot get lost! Also, it's so easy to use: make sure the camera settings are right, set the camera to fully remote, slightly press the shutter button till you hear a beep (to ignite the remote) and then you can use the remote by pressing the button on the remote to shoot. It's a marvel of technology making the life of a photographer more convenient and allowing more sharp pictures without blur."
4136,I purchased this remote for a gift.  The remote seems to function at described and my family member was pleased.  I have a Nikon camera as well but have not tried the remote myself.  I would like to try the Company A model this year and compare both units.  I have a plan to use a small telescopic inspection mirror (not in camera field of view)indoors and outdoors to test the use of the remote behind the camera on a tripod.  I believe bouncing the beam will work.  I will try to update the post after further testing.
4137,"This remote works as expected, nothing more or less. You must make sure you have it it on the remote setting in the camera for it to work. You must also aim it at the front, or side,of the camera (line of sight) within about 15 feet. This is for the infrared signal to function. Works great with my Nikon D40 and my D90. Battery lasts a looonngg time, I haven't replaced mine in my original remote for a good 3 or 4 years."
4138,"I bought this to plug into the headphone jack of my computer. I was using my headphones for other things as well, and got tired of crawling on my belly to find the jack to plug them in again. This extension cord was much cheaper than at the store, and serves that purpose perfectly. No complaints."
4139,The sound quality this cable provides is fine for me. If you are looking for a cheap longer cable look no further this will do the job.
4140,"This has proved to be my standard wildlife lens, great for distances and really small birds.When you can't afford to put 10-12K in a lens, this is the perfect replacement."
4141,"Hello everyone. I bought this lens earlier in 2009 and had it for a couple of months. I bought this lens solely because I tend to shoot a lot of portrait for my friends on my cropped-sensor Canon 30D . I was usingTamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP ZL Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Camerasas an all-around lens and it was a great lens for portraits.However, I have heard and read a lot of great reviews about this lens and it was reasonably priced so I bought it when I had the money. I was blown away by the quality of the photo it took. It is good for low light shoots and for portrait in general. The focusing is smooth and silent but I wish it had better build quality (I still use film camera and old lenses from the 70's-80's so you will understand why).The camera also gives a great bokeh (background blur).Now, I thought I'd write this review after I lent the lens to a friend for use with his 450D. He called me after a week and said that all his friends liked the quality of the pictures. One of the guys took the camera and shot random shots and said this lens always takes good shots, it just can't take any bad ones! Coming from someone who is not very enthusiastic about photography, I think for us Amateurs/Enthusiast/Professionals would find it even more convenient.You can read a lot of professional reviews for this lens and also view sample of pictures taken by the lens. Go read websites like Ken Rockwell's and browse through pbase ([...]) and you wouldn't be able to wait to get this masterpiece.I recommend this lens for anyone who wants to take quality portrait for family and friends and even on a professional level. You will not be disappointed.If I had extra money, I would consider 135mm f/2.0L or 70-200mm f/2.8L."
4142,"This is an excellent lens for shooting portraits.  Very sharp even in the corners.  Reasonably fast focus.  I think f1.8 provides all the versatility most photographers would need.  If anything, I find the depth of field at f1.8 so shallow that it is useful only rarely.  I don't see the point of f1.2.  Usually I need more depth of field to get someone's head in focus unless I am some distance away.  For just 20% of the cost of the f1.2 L series 85mm, this lens is a great value."
4143,"I really like this lens.  It's made a huge improvement to my images.  I even added a Speedlite 430EX II which is a great combination.  This focuses much better than some of the cheaper lenses I have.  I find it easier to get a sharper image, but I think more of that has to do with my body."
4144,"I bought these after witnessing a gouge in my friend's unprotected LCD screen on his Brand New $500 digital camera ! I have several cameras with varying LCD sizes. This product is perfect as it allows me to cut out the different sizes that I need without spending a small fortune. Btw, it comes with cut-out templates on the back of each card which is extremely helpful ! A Must-Buy !!!"
4145,"Bought this for a multimeter to computer interface. I have used Radio Shack versions before for other applications, and found them to give a bit of trouble occasionally, however this one has worked every single time I have used it. I am confident enough with it, that I don't even think twice about using it, which is sure a change from the other ones where I always wondered how much trouble I would have to go through to get it working.Easy to use, and just forget about it!"
4146,Purchased this cable to connect my laptop to a display sign that uses a telephone jack to receive serial communications.  Works very well when you need a serial RS232 connector and don't have one.
4147,Works great for connecting my Windows 7 64-bit HTPC to my Nuvo Essentia E6G whole-house audio system.  My only complaint is that I had to rip out the connector posts since I wanted to connect it directly to the Nuvo.  A little time with a vise-grip fixed the problem though.
4148,Price was right so I decided to splurge and buy this to attach to a TI calculator.  Seems to work on my 83+ and my N-Spire.  Now if it would just cure the N-Spire from randomly erasing all the material I typed into it!
4149,"Being something of an electronic gadget klutz, I admit to having trepidations when I ordered this piece of equipment.  I had never set up a network -- to say nothing of a wireless one.When the product arrived, I could not have been more surprised at the ease of set-up.  Following the advice of the quick start instructions and set-up CD included in the package, I had the network up and running in less than five minutes.  Not even a glitch.  In what seemed to be no time, I was wirelessly surfing the web with no apparent loss of speed compared to my wired connection.To sum it up, this is a great product."
4150,I have installed three of these in the past Year. With the new installation CD that came with the last two units it is a snap to set up a network and get on line. The price is right and you will have to work hard to mess it up. The range is good and it works with no problems. Can't expect much more for 50 dollars.
4151,"I'm going to be moving soon. One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection. Got the Linksys after reading some reviews. Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. But everything worked out for the best.After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo. Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity."
4152,The people who sold this were extremely fast in dispatching it to me. And since Linksys is a trusted name in Networking products so I was never disappointed upon recieving this product. It just worked wonders for me.
4153,"I decided to dust off a 5-year old laptop (Winbook Z1) the other day and install Ubuntu on it. I selected this card because of the Atheros chipset. I can't believe how easy it was to get it working. I plugged it in, installed Ubuntu and the new OS recognized the card. With in minutes I was on the internet, thanks to my neighbor's open WiFi. After a few hours of reading some wiki's and messages, I had WPA running and my ""new"" Linux laptop was on my network. Piece of cake! Great card and great chipset!"
4154,"This works very well and have had no problems,easy setup for broadband.I am very satisfied.Also great price"
4155,This is a nice Hands free headset.  It works great.  I use it all the time and like it a lot.
4156,"I know that this doesn't come with any buttons, but that's fine with me!It's better to have something basic!  It gives me more security that it won't break down!This is awesome!Some people have said they can't hear me, but I think it is because of their connection, because that happens VERY RARELY!I work over the phone at least 20 hours a week, and this is my life (and arm) saver!"
4157,"after couple days of use, I have to re-write the reviewthis card has very good receptionhowever, it shows only when not under heavy loadthe reception drops dramatically when under load (file transfer, streaming radio)after talking w/belkin ts, they suggest the driver from web, unfortunately, I am using with THIS driver, not the one with CD (I lost it the way back home after purchasing)I'll give it back 5 stars once I found the solution of this issue (it happens on both laptop, even with any configuration)"
4158,"I been using this pci wireless card for about a year on my computer, first with windows vista x64 and now more recently with windows 7 x64, and no problems so far, windows doesn't have this card drivers, you have to put the cd in the computer and install the drivers then they will get updated automatically to the latest version via windows update. I din't install any of the linkys supplied software."
4159,"just what I needed to go put my disks in, now for the other 6 words words words words words"
4160,I buy these to record an hour long radio program on each side without a dead spot.  After about 15 years I've found the Maxell's and TDK's about equal and I buy them in bulk from whoever has a good deal.  They do the job.Good service from the the vendor too.
4161,I LIKE THIS DOCKING STATION THE BEST. I HAVE OWNED OTHERS. KODAK HIT A HOME RUN WITH THIS ONE.
4162,I bought this item (black) and when it failed I went to Belkin website and they exchanged it without question. The replacement is the same model number but white.
4163,"I use these headphones everday at work.  They are very comfortable.  The foldup design along with the case you put them work well and are high quality.  While their sound does not compare with my full-sized Sennheiser HD555 headphones I have at home, their sound is not far behind!  I hate to admit it, but they are much more comfortable to wear than the SD 555's.  I would not hestiate to recommend these PX 100's to anyone who is considering compact headphones, or to someone who wants to wear headphones for hours at a time."
4164,"The sound out of these headphones is very defined and balanced. Probably the best compact earphones I have ever used. There is plenty of low, without being over emphasized or boomy, and the mids and highs are very clear. The price pushes them easily into 5 star territory.There are three issues to be aware of though. 1) They are probably inappropriate for use in an office if you listen to your music loud, since others can hear what your listening too. However, they do allow you to hear coworkers through your music :) 2) They do not block ambient noise, so they are poor choices for train or plane traveling. 3) Finally, They will force you to rerip your songs to a higher bitrate, since you WILL be able to tell the difference between a 128 bit MP3 and a CD with these phones on."
4165,"These are really great headphones.  They have have rich, deep bass and beautiful high end.  Everyone who tries them on remarks immediately &quot;these are great headphones.&quot;The other great thing is that no matter how loud you blast these, and I've gone waaaay up, no one can hear what you are listening to.  Be cautious though, because I've almost been hit by the train wearing them in the morning, and the conductor gets really angry when I don't here him ask me for my ticket."
4166,The subject modem was easy to install and the enclosed CD software made setup a breeze.
4167,"When I ordered the patch panel, it wasn't quite clear to me what I was going to get.  I was getting one because people I respect in this area told me to get one to clean up the space where 8 CAT-6 cables come together, but I really didn't know what I was getting or how it would be helpful.To start with, the picture is misleading.  You don't get everything in the picture.  The picture shows what 16-, 24- and 48-port patch panels look like.  You only get one--the one you order.But here's how it works.  You cut all the CAT-6 cables coming in to length, then use a punch tool (two were enclosed) to push the wires into receptacles on the back side of the panel (the side you can't see in the picture).  Then you just plug ethernet cables into the openings in the front--and voila, you have a very neat-looking setup.One concern I had coming in was that I wanted to mount the patch panel between studs (16"" OC) in my basement, but the patch panel is designed to be used in a rack with bars 19 inches apart.  It turned out that the 16-port panel worked great--the outside space on both ends is vacant, so the whole thing slid in easily between studs.  I don't think this would work with the 24- or 48-port panels, but it worked great with the 16-port panel.  In fact, I found that one space that was double-studded left exactly the right amount of room for the patch panel, and I was able to press it into place and have it hold without using any nail or screws at all!I've been using the panel for several months now and have had absolutely no problems so far."
4168,"I git this proudct for 2 reasons: I live in one of the crappiest areas of the country for radio reception, and I'm legally blind.I really thought I'd never enjoy playing with a radio again. Boy, was I wrong.XM has brought the thrill back. In spades.If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would."
4169,"My Bose CD player with add-on changer are four years old and I use it every day.  My CD's were skipping so I bought this cleaning kit.  It did the job and I was very pleased with the results.  I have tried other cleaning systems, and they were not as effective as this."
4170,"The bad news first.  It is discontinued.  The good news It is discontinued and you can pick this marvel up at a more than reasonable price.  I bought mine for under 200.00 brand new and with waranty.I won't bore you with photophile lingo and tech stuff there are others far more capable of such information who have already given their astute observations.  I will tell you the the clarity of this lens beats the Panasonic Lumix by a mile and I know that because I have one.I just got back from a week of shooting at Cape Cod through all kinds of weather conditions from bright sun reflected off of calm waters to dim foggy lit terrain and I am ecstatic with my portfolio.I have had the c-765 and it was just too small and then the 725 and it was too big with only an 8x zoom.  This camera size weight and layout were perfect.I am so pleased with the distance shots and the clarity of all the shots as well as the capability to capture visual nuance and light I am selling my lumix and buying another one of these while I can.Yes I know it only has 3 something image mp but 3. 2 or 9 with a razor sharp lense is worth all the other mega pixel cameras in the world. NO there is no photo stabilization but I know how to use a tripod and to steady a camera so I don't see it as a loss.  Stabilization is for the film maker in my mind and I am tired of people whining about not having it in every still camera.To me photograhy is about the light and the lens and now that I have hundreds of beautiful poetic or razor sharp images I know the brand and kind of digital camera I want ot use.I strongly suggest this camera and some basic photography lessons for those who can't get the shot right because then you will see what a gem this little beauty really is.From animal to seascape to haunted fields with fantastic depth of field or moody expressionism this camera gave me its all.Great lens, easy layout, uses rechargable aa batteries, full function for manual and cheap. My God what a bargain."
4171,"These are great.  They worked well.  I haven't measured them, but they are close or at 3 ft.  I would recommend these and would buy again."
4172,"Noiseless, lightweight and oh yeah...WORKS GREAT!!!Silverish color really adds a special touch.  Who cares if it doesn't have multiple slots?  It plays just about any format(check before you buy if it plays yours.)If you watch DVDs once in a while like I do, get this!  Apex is made in USA and is one of the underrated brands out there.If you watch one DVD per weekm its yours.  However, I don't know the dvd's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing.  Either way, can't go wrong with this price."
4173,"It's well made product that simply does what it is supposed to do. I live on the 22nd floor of a 24 story building on the beach in Miami. I could not get good reception on most of the local stations consistently. Some days some channels would be clear, others not. Moving the single wire antenna would work sometimes and other times not at all. It was hard to get a good signal because my body would somehow help the reception until I moved away. This unit plugged into my Tivoli radio and suddenly all available stations became much clearer with no static. I'm very happy with this antenna."
4174,Great little camera...I was looking for something that I can carry around and take reasonably good pictures with by just pushing down the shutter...I am very happy with this puppy. Picture quality is great - certainly good enough for 13x19 prints...Camera is responsive - quick shutter during daylight and fast save to memory stick - allowing multiple pictures in a short time.The built in scene-selections are sufficient for me...The only gripe I have is that the camera does not auto-rotate pictures taken in portrait orientation (my 5 year old Kodak had no problem doing that)...
4175,"Dimage XT is a competent digital camera and takes good-quality pictures.  I'm not sure about some reviewers' negative comments.  Maybe they work for competition.  You should not take anyone's word but should try out the camera in a store to see it for yourself.  You'll be amazed at its cool-ness and fun-ness and also good picture quality.  I think this is the best ultra compact digital camera.  If your serious about photography you may want to get a Canon or Olympus SLR digitla camera as your main equipment but use this as a fun, capture-teh-moment-kind-of back-up.  Luv ya all."
4176,Great price for a great product. Bought two. You will have no problems with large plugs and the unused outlets cover-up to keep my kids fingers out!!!
4177,"Reading the negative reviews here I have to wonder how many people realize that you MUST go through a new CHANNEL SEARCH each and every time you attach a different antenna or move your antenna to a new location.  Of course, with a powered antenna, you must do this with the power on.  That said, different antennas can yield different results in different signal areas.  I'm in Los Angeles, about 24 miles from the broadcast antennas.  Since all the broadcasters transmit from about the same location, I'm better off with a very DIRECTIONAL antenna, which this seems to be.  However, no antenna can work well in my location UNLESS I LINE IT UP WITH A WINDOW FACING THE BROADCAST ANTENNA DIRECTION.  If I just put the antenna on top of the TV, I will get about 4 to 7 stations.  In the ideal location, up high near the window, I get over 80 channels.  Because the antenna is about 20 feet from the TV now, I had to use a 20 ft. coax cable to connect it.  It worked fine, but switching to the old-fashioned twinlead (with coax connectors mounted on each end for compatibility) improved the signal gain a bit and brought in a few more stations.  (It is known to have even less signal loss than coax as long as you give it a twist every 3 feet and it remains dry, which it will indoors!)"
4178,I needed something that I could carry in my pocket and take with me anywhere outside working in my garden. This is perfect.
4179,Good product.  Nice base sound for the cheap price.The cable is a little too short IN comparing to the aPPLE IPod earbuds.
4180,"I didn't think I'd need a new dedicated MP3 player since I already have a few Pocket PCs, but as I took up jogging, I needed something small and wearable.  Then one day I saw a guy jogging with the Lyra, so I said what the heck, it was on sale at CC, so I bought it.  What a good decision!  The French designed Chinese made MP3 player has very good sound, which is probably the most important thing with an MP3 player.  Of course, getting the files in is probably even more important, otherwise what's the point, right?  Here I use it with my Fujitsu laptop running XP.  I used Windows Media Player to load the internal 128MB with almost 3 hours of my all-time favorites (some in WMA and others in MP3), then I bought a Panasonic 256MB SD card which I'll use to store music that I'll change often.  I haven't tried any MP3Pro files, since I don't have any encoded in that format, but with WMA you can save 50% in storage vs. MP3 and get the same quality music.  I just don't want to convert my MP3s to WMAs, plus storage is cheap.  But it's good to have a player so versatile and having such good sound.  I also like the buttons &quot;last&quot; and &quot;next&quot;; finally the French are doing something that makes sense!  Like I said, it's made in China, so don't expect the Japanese kind of high-tech finish, but the player seems durable enough for my newly started jogging career.  Best of all, as many others have pointed out, a totally great price for an expandable MP3 player."
4181,"Does exactly as described. It limits the volume to a set level (set by you with your normal volume control) and eliminates that maddening up and down volume adjusting every time there is a commercial or some loud action sequence in the movie. I plugged mine in between the dish receiver's audio outputs and the TV's audio inputs per the directions, turned it on and viola!!! It's just ""set and forget""!!! I do hear a little ""pop"" every once in a rare occasion, but that's a small price to pay for my sanity!!! I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!  :^)"
4182,"Executive summary: I've had a sudden spat of leaky batteries.  Maybe Panasonic can do better.The leaky batteries include ones that came with a Gerber flashlight and were rebranded as Gerber.  More disturbingly, two different sets of Duracell.  One set was in a wall clock, the other in a cordless mouse.  Duracell is OK about replacing things, but also was patronizing by implying that the leakage was due to trying to recharge the ruined mouse. I've been fairly loyal to Duracell for about 20 years, but am finding myself open to try other brands.It's hard to review batteries.  These are the right size, the right voltage, and haven't leaked.  The other ones, the ones that leaked, sat around for years before they failed.  Time will tell.Five stars (for now) because the batteries are doing exactly what they are supposed to do.  One little drip from any of them though..."
4183,I have three Tivos running through each one and then the signals are sent throughout the house. The remote feature is perfect. I just ordered two more to expand my system.
4184,"These are very reasonably priced earphones that are great for workouts.  You can wear them under a helmet.  they are durable,  but once they break,  they're cheap enough to replace."
4185,"We did a lot of research into various small telescopes and binoculars before deciding to buy the ""Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars"". We already own aMeade ETX90EC Telescope w/ UHTC, Autostar Controller (497) and Tripod (884), but find that setting it up can often become a time consuming production, especially when we just want a quick view of something in the night sky. Sure our regular telescope is better for looking at planets and provides much higher magnification, but there are times when we don't use it because of the hassle of transporting it and setting it up. With the Celestron SkyMasters and a good monopod, we are now ready to view both terrestrial events and stargazing in just a few minutes.Here are my observations:Pros:Very Clear OpticsCrisp Focusing (no ""bounce"" or drift at all)Built In Tripod Mount and Included Adapter (must use with binoculars this powerful)Very Inexpensive For Binoculars of This QualityCons:HUGE Size (these are BIG, you will need a tripod/monopod for extended use)Overall, the Celestron SkyMaster is a great pair of binoculars for the price, Highly Recommended! You might also want to considerGalileo 20x60 Binoculars"
4186,This cable modem has been very reliable for me.  Absolutely no issues.  I use Comcast- and even run a small linux server (provides email and web serving for a few relatives.)
4187,"Since my digital camera and dv cam are both canon, I can carry one power cord and the 2 bricks. This small bag fits my G1 and my optura 30, 2 bricks, 1 powercord, usb cable and 6 tapes. It all fits perfectly."
4188,"I purchased several of these as part of a portable production kit so I could offer audio monitoring to others and give them their own, independent audio control.  That little device in-line on the cord is very helpful, and somewhat hard to find on lightweight models like this.The folding feature is nice, it hasn't broken yet, and reasonably gentle treatment has allowed it to stay intact and functioning for over a year now.Its not the loudest version available, though.  For that I have also purchased another, non-collapsible model: the Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium headphones.Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium Portable Headphones with Volume Control(They are not made with real titanium, though.)"
4189,Good splitter worked on the airplane and did its job... Can't complain at all. Well the end that plugs into the device is fat and doesn't really work with some iPhone case
4190,"I have 4 computers connected through a KVM switch, and the newer ones have no PS/2 ports.  I've tried virtually all of the available alternatives, and this is the only one which has worked right out of the box with both an HP laptop (Vista) a Midnight Desktop (Vista) and a Gateway desktop (XP SP2).  The workmanship on other splitters was awful--I returned one of the alternatives you can find on Company A 3 different times--once the mouse worked, but not the kbd, once the kbd worked but not the mouse.  I tried another unit where the kbd and mouse wire had to be swapped, and it stopped functioning in about two weeks.  The replacement shipped for that one did not work at all...This one worked right away on three different machines.Go buy a cheaper one that you'll have to RMA 2 or 3 times before you give up, convince yourself that I'm right, and then come back and get this one.  For the extra $8-$10 this one costs you'll be much happier."
4191,"I purchased this stick for my DSC-F717, which eats memory stick space.I get 98 pictures at the highest 2560 resolution, at over 2 MB per picture.  Of course at the lower settings, I can take an entire vacation worth of pictures without having to empty or replace the card.This is superior to the cheaper 256 MB solutions, as you don't have to remove the card and flip a switch to access half of it.  The memory is all contiguous."
4192,"--When planted, the monopod is firm, even when at its greatest height (which is higher than I would need).  It is lightweight and easy to put or carry the camera upon.  I have several cameras, and anticipated that it would be easier to use the monopod wit"
4193,"5 star SubI have been piecing together a 7.1 system from May of 2011 until today. I added the final member to the family in this beast that is one of my rears. I am pushing 6ohms, 120 watts of power per channel. I went to 10.5 decibels with my receiver and these speaker were ridiculously crisp.. NO sign of crackling or blowing.. I eventually will push these to the max of my receiver. I am not sure what it will go up to..I did best bang for the buck and chose the following because of high ratings and BIC America states they guarantee their speakers for 5 years and that they can handle anything that you push through them.

4194,"The Polk 505 has a tight, clean bass presence that adds richness to soundtracks and movies.As long as you don't push it too hard.So if you want to add rich bass and LFE for viewing pleasure, this is the best $189 you will ever spend.But if you are looking to shake the house with intense infrasound every time something explodes on the screen, you will be disappointed. This is an adult subwoofer.Unlike many low-price powered subs, the 505 amp is well shielded and immune to radio frequency interference from amateur radio transmitters."
4195,I got the tripod as a gift and haven't seen it but the recipient said it was great.
4196,"This ones are really good, great sound, but they get dirty really really quickThey're not uncomfortable, the cable it's a little short, but they're good overall"
4197,"This wireless headphone is awesome. Very clear sound for my TV. Excellent reception  too.This is an Infrared IR type so it needs line of site, but still no matter how I turn my head, there is no signal loss. I had to leave the room to loose signal.Also make sure you use Line Output from your TV instead of the headphone jack. Line Output is NOT controlled by your TV volume so it is always at max level. This will eliminate hearing any hiss sound because you are not trying to increase volume via the wireless headphone with a low input level. That's the cause of the hiss sound from other reviewers. You know this is the same thing with other devices such as an iPod... if you set your iPod at low volume and connect it to an external speaker (using stereo cable, not even wireless) and you turn up volume on the external speaker only, hiss sound will start to come out. So this is not just an issue with wireless headphones.Overall, I am very happy with this product and definitely recommends it."
4198,I had a very slow pentium 4 266 and I thought nothing would make it perform better. I decided to take a chance and order this ram its made my computer so much faster and reliable. I just can't believe how good this ram works on that old PC. If you have a PC that uses this ram I say buy it and try it you won't regret it.
4199,"This is the best microphone i've used it picks up everything in the room even if you are far away from it and has no distortion. The only inconvenience for me was the green led lights underneath the on/off button but i've easily fixed this by opening up the microphone and clipping the contacts from the led bulbs. Covering the button with electric tape also works, but just doesn't look as good."
4200,"Take all the good reviews about this product, and I agree with all the positives. I even like the Kensington Expert Trackball Mouse BETTER than my Microsoft Trackball Explorer (SHAMEFULLY discontinued by Microsoft) in some respects! But I have to admit that my Explorer mouse is a bit more comfortable for long periods of constant use.I don't think the product description on Company A mentions that you can assign SIX different functions at a time to this mouse! That's because not only can you assign a different function to each button (there are 4 buttons), but you can ALSO assign a function that works when you press both top buttons together, and another function that works when you press both bottom buttons together!  I chose to assign  ""click"", ""right click"", ""cut"", & ""paste"" to the single buttons, and chose ""back"" and ""forward"" for the simultaneous buttons. And just in case you don't want  any or all of the buttons to do anything when they are pushed, you can assign them to ""do nothing"" as well. This might be useful for people who keep accidentally pushing a button because of their particular hand shape or hand position.I've also found that the ""fluid"" vs. ""space down"" motion of the scroll wheel depends on the application that is running, and not a big deal to me. If you always want a fluid scrolling motion you can always choose one of your buttons to ""drag"" the screen fluidly up or down using the trackball.I mostly decided to write this review to let all you Mac OS X  w/ Intel chip and Leopard OS users know that you can get ALL the buttons programmed after downloading ""Kensington MouseWorks for Mac OS X Version 3.0"" software from the Kensington website [...]. Never mind that it says it was last updated on 5/30/06 - once you download that version to your Intel Mac (do not click on ""search for latest update"" when the box comes up so you only download THAT particular version) you can then program ALL the buttons (I own a new 2008 MacBook Pro and it worked for me). At least we can use the available Version 3.0 until they create a newer updated Mouseworks Software Version that fixes the Intel Mac problem.I LOVE the ""keystrokes"" option to add custom button settings (i.e. if you want a button to be ""Back"", first type the Apple ""Command"" button followed by the ""["" key in the top box, and then label it ""Back"" in the bottom box;  I've found that you must label/name it last so that the ""OK"" button lights up and you can click on it. Likewise, if you wanted another button to be ""Paste"", choose the ""Keystrokes"" option, then type the Apple ""Command"" button followed by ""V"" in the top box, and then label it ""Paste"" below and ""OK"" (save) it. It's so easy to assign practically anything to a button (even opening up an assigned URL or application)...very cool.And if you aren't able to set some of the parameters for how the trackball mouse responds through the ""Mouseworks"" application settings, try tweaking the standard mouse application settings.To think I almost returned this product! Thank goodness for internet searches!"
4201,"Works for Ipod Dock connector this is the 3rd generation Ipod, Not Touch screen.This is the only way to charge this Ipod, I am happy I found it here."
4202,"Hooked these up through my computer via toslink and Yamaha receiver along with Yamaha YST-SW216BL 10"" sub-woofer in a 10X12 room. I am thrilled with the sound. Love the build and look of the speakers. Could not see spending more for the sub than for the whole speaker set. The Yamaha sub is fine for $94 through Vann's also. The speaker wire post connections alone set these speakers apart from any others in this price range. Call me satisfied."
4203,I purchased these mic's for my wedding videography company to use during all day film shoots.  They stand up to the constant use and reuse.  I highly recommend if you're in a high paced industry.  They hold up and maintain performance as advertised.
4204,"It does the job.  You may be able to find cheaper ones but take it from me, that's not always the best way to go.  I bought a $3 cap previously and it was cheaply made.  The threads were messed up on it and it didn't attach to the threads on my adapter well at all.  It did not stay on to good which, unless I'm mistaken, is the entire purpose for a lens cap.  This cap is NOT a replacement for the slip on cap that comes with the S2/S3 cameras.  It is made for use with an adapter and UV/filter lens."
4205,"Replaced 2 failed cards, why they fail so easily is a mystery. I already changed them once. In many years in this business I have not seen NIC cards fail so often."
4206,"Had this two days and so far LOVE it! First the size is not as small as the Pentax Optio S but it was small enough to fit in my pocket no problem. Default settings out of the box with 16MB SD card allowed me 19 clear shots in a room that only had my TV and one 25 watt flourescent light on (no adjustments whatsoever) or 16 shots and a short 20 sec video. SO GET A BIGGER SD card (I got an OEM 128MB sd card which works fine and cheaper than Canon's branded one)! Manual is easy to understand and controls are easy to manipulate, well spaced and LCD display is crisp. I was first considering the A70 since I wanted a good 3 MP below $300 but found the A70 too heavy and bulky to fit in my pocket. The 2x zoom is not great but I figure to be using this mostly for indoor shots that I can move closer to anyway. And from all the test shots I have done objects about 20-30 feet away still very clear and crisp even when zooming in from a distance and then zooming into the object itself. So far though it does what I want it to do, is small, has a solid feel and great pictures! The movie resolution in default is also fluid and clear and sound is clean too. I have yet to change any settings on this and out of the box I LOVE it!!!!Easy to use, good picture quality, small size, great looks, cheap price... what more could I want?!! Oh and the fingerprints are not an issue either cause they wipe off easily off the stainless steel body. 5 stars!!!!"
4207,The sound is amazing!!! I am very happy with my new speakers!!! I replaced 4 of these in my 2000 ford expedition and works great!!! I extremely recommend this product.
4208,"Purchased 3 Monopods to compare them to pick the best one.  This one came in on top by far except for price.  It was plenty tall, I am 6 ft and it was tall enough for my Nikon 510 to work without adjusting to pole and the sections locked well.  Supplied plastic hex wrench allowed fine tuning the locks and clipped to the pole to be handy in the field.  One test I did was after full extension was to tap the pole on the carpeted floor sharply a few times to see if the locks slipped.  None of them did as it came from the box.  The oval cross-section adds rigidity.  The fact that it had no ball attachment on it already as compared to the second place one which did (the Monopod 500 by Canon) made the choice hard.  I went with the Manfrotto because even though it was 10 oz heavier, it was definitely sturdier.  The bottom section on the Monopod 500 by Canon was about 3/8 to 1/2 in in diameter.  The Manfrotto was 5/8 inch and heavier a guage.  This pole was the shortest tested when closed (20in versus 21.5 for the other two)  The Manfrotto supported 22 lb. versus 7 lb. for the other two.  Ask the wife her opinion between the three and after hefting them and looking them over she liked the larger hand grip on the Manfrotto and the sturdiness of it.Follow up to the above:  I have used this pole on a trip to Alaska and as a walking pole on trips all over, including on airline trips where I use it to help get me to gates far apart as I have a bad knee.  It really does function extremely well as a walking staff being very sturdy and collapsible to a very short length that fits on board as part of my carryon baggage.  TSA people have really liked it and have received many inquiries from strangers who see me using it."
4209,"I use Manfrotto quick releases RC2, RC4, and RC5. RC2 being the smallest and most compact was where I started. Now I use it on my monopod and macro rail, which doesn't have a quick release by itself. It works out great. Only thing about RC2 is that the screw may not fall into the hole completely every time, especially when in a hurry. When that happens, the lock can't be securely locked. It let go on me once because of this, my own user-error. But it does show a design flaw. The RC4 and RC5 are completely pro grade, solid and secure. But more expensive, heavier and much bigger. RC2 fits my rail perfect in size and weight so I went for RC2 instead the other two. But I do use RC4 between the geared head and macro rail."
4210,"Good filter, used to protect the actual lens"
4211,Excellent filter for a very good price. Multi-Coated so reflections are minimized. You can spend more but you'll not get better performance.
4212,"Very thin, superb quality. I'm always happy with Sigma products.The quality of all the images I've taken so far is really good."
4213,"There are so many thorough reviews and great pictures on this bag, I'm not going to write another redundant one; great bag, very good price, quality was better than I expected.One thing I do want to say, is there are two other compartments that none of the other reviews seem to touch on, and the images do not show.  Being a camera bag, everyone is focusing their review on the main compartment, and that is well, but one of the reasons I didn't get this before is that I want a regular backpack that also happens to be a camera bag. Well this is it actually, it's just hard to tell from the images/reviews.It has two good sized front zippered areas (the full front area) for wallets, sunglasses, plane tickets, pens, calculators, light windbreaker, and general daily what-not as well. This is a real selling point for me, and one that would have insured a sale when I first looked at it, rather than trying a LowePro backpack first that I found to be way over-priced (3x$ this bag), and only half as versatile (except for the laptop slot, which was nice).Can't imagine finding a better deal in this price range."
4214,"I have had this backpack for several years now.  I didn't purchase it at Company A, but I was doing some other product reviews, and saw this recommended for me.  So, I decided to give it a review...Like I said, I have had it for a few years and it is still my everyday camera bag/backpack.  I love this thing!  I do a lot of hiking and adventure type activities, and am always the designated photographer for family activities and portraits.  This backpack is perfect for me.The main compartment holds my gripped Canon 60D (formerly my 20D), Canon 24-70L, 70-200L, 580EX flash, a Gary Fong lightsphere (non-collapsible), battery charger, spare batteries for camera and flash, memory card case, filters, and all sorts of extras.  That's just in the main compartments.  The two inside webbed zipper pockets are useful, as well.  No joke, but I can actually put my Impact 32"" collapsible reflector inside the main compartment too!The front ""flap"" has two separate zippered compartments - one large, and one smaller.  These are nice to hold maps, brochures, wallet, keys, smart phone, some snacks, and whatever else you might think of.  The outside of this flap has another external flap you see secured by the cord/webbing in the photo.  For me, this is a perfect place to hold my water bottles.There are two outside pockets with velcro flaps.  In one of them I keep a poncho for myself, and another rain protector to use for the bag itself if I'm caught out in the weather.  The pockets are big enough to hold a small tripod sticking out, which can be secured with the strap above each pocket.  What's nice, is that when not using the straps, I just put them inside the pockets with the velcro flap holding them in.  Then they aren't in the way or get snagged on branches or anything.Speaking of tripods, the backpack did come with two straps on the bottom to hold a tripod horizontally.  For my purposes, I removed these straps, because when not in use they just dangled there.  I don't like to have things that can potentially snag me or my gear when hiking in the woods.The backpack is very comfortable to wear either on both shoulders, or slung across one.  The part that is against your back is padded very nicely, and so are the straps.  The top of the backpack has a loop, so you can just grab it and go.The build quality is excellent.  Not one single part of this backpack is showing excessive wear, and I use this thing a lot!WARNING TO POTENTIAL PURCHASERS:  The only complaint I have is a very important one.  However, with a simple fix, it is not enough to drop my five star rating.  The main compartment opens all the way up with two zippers.  In normal use and loaded with gear, these zippers have a tendency to start unzipping.  As this is on your back, you won't notice if they unzip too far, and...  There goes your expensive gear!My fix is very simple and might cost you a buck.  Buy a small carabiner and latch the two zippers together using the holes in the zippers.  That way, if they unzip, they unzip together, and never open the bag.  One opens, and one closes right behind it.  It is a very small inconvenience for me to unhook and re-hook the carabiner to feel confident that my gear is safe.One minor modification that I did to this backpack:  I didn't like the big ""Canon"" logo plaque advertising to potential thieves what I was carrying around.  I simply opened the front zipper pocket, and cut off the part that holds the metal plaque on the back.  It's very simple, and does not damage the backpack at all.  It just leaves two small holes behind that are barely noticeable.  Now, it just looks like a regular hiker's backpack.I love this thing!"
4215,"If you go to a local retail store, your choices are very ""lame"" for something that can protect your gear at a descent price. Wal-Mart sells cheap handy-cam/camera bags for $15.00 (no name) to a $29.99 Sony that won't hold anything but the camera itself.The 200EG from Canon holds quite a bit is well made. I was able to fit my Canon HV20 camcorder, battery charger, 2x batteries, 3x lenses, cables and connectors, manual, lens cleaner, lens hood, pistol grip holder, and still had plenty of room for more.This is one of the best deals for a backpack for cameras and small camcorders around. I saw many ""GREAT"" reviews on this one before buying, for all the bad ones, show me another that offers this much, for the $$$. If it does not have enough room for you, spend 2-3x the $$ and get one that does. No reason to blame the bag, just go with another."
4216,What a GREAT experience.  The backpack was delivered on time in new condition.  The product is amazing and was also an AMAZING price.  I would definitely order from these folks again.  Thanks guys!
4217,Fit my 18-200mm lens perfectly and I like that I can turn it around when not needed.  Recommend the EW78BII hood to all Canon D60 owners you won't regret the purchase!
4218,"This it an awesome lens, it has great clarity and with the 17-40mm capability a great range of uses. The light gathering capability is fantastic."
4219,"I think it very well could be so I'm not going to differ with those who say it is.I bought this to use with a new 5D and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off.I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps.  I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick.I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots.Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus.One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. But I've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. The effect with lights, etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field."
4220,I love this lens! It's on my Canon EOS 20D everytime I go take pictures. Auto-focusing is fast. Great for low-light situations where flash isn't allowed. It isn't a true wide-angle with the crop factor of a digital camera but it still works fine for me.Off topic a bit. I ordered this lens and was being shipped to me. The courier had it damaged and Company A replaced it the next day free of charge! This is why I love shopping here!
4221,"Very sharp lens, excellent IS, and the lens hood is built in.Was on the fence with several choices, purchased the 300mm F/4L after seeing several examples and reading reviews.My first use was at a live concert, I took it just for kicks and gave it a try to see what it would do. The capture of emotion and the bokeh were amazing. Since then I have been to a few baseball games and out in the yard with pets and it has not let me down. The ring that comes with the lens is smooth for a quick loosen and flip for verticals on a monopod/tripod.* Sharp and Fast, you can not ask for more from any other lens. The case is nice to have in order to keep it safe.My setup: Canon 6D, T3i  with 300mm F/4L, monopod with ball head."
4222,Worked perfectly while my camera was on a tripod. This is a well made product and a lot cheaper than a lot of others that I found
4223,"I have found genuine Domke products (there are a number of fakes out there) to be the perfect combination of security and minimalism.  In the case of Domke inserts, they are more moldable than the competing inserts and compliment Domke bags perfectly as they keep the bag from becoming too rigid.When first transitioning from excessively padded compartments to Domke, you will be concerned about your gear being properly protected.  Trust me, after extended use and abuse, these inserts will not let you down unless you need to protect your equipment from 20 foot falls onto concrete.  Using these inserts, especially in Domke bags, provides great flexibility and usability without bulk and weight.Many people are turned off upon receipt citing build quality because the foam appears to come out of the inserts.  The build quality is fine.  They are actually designed this way for flexibility.  They will not come apart (unless they are not genuine Domke)."
4224,I bought this as an add-on to my Lowepro system. It performs exactly as expected and hasn't shown any signs of wear. I would definately recommend.
4225,"Photographers are always looking for the ""perfect bag"", The Domke while somewhat small, isvery well made and offers a zippered top, under a flap which makes the case very secure andvery weatherproof. A very good buy from Company A."
4226,"I've owned many Domke products over the years and this isOne of my favorites! I use this to hold a Quantum Turbo Battery one day, and hold lens the next. Its also just the perfect size for a Contax G2 or a digital camera like the Canon G12."
4227,"I've only had the battery a few days, so I can only give my first impressions (though if necessary I will update this review). The battery came in a plastic blister pack, heat-sealed all the way around. I cut it out and placed it in my Insignia flash HD (NS-DCC5HB09) camcorder (from Best Buy but now discontinued), and it fit perfectly. Next, I gave the battery a full charge (through the camcorder), and it seems to be working all right. The camcorder came with only one battery and replacement batteries from Best Buy in-store cost about three times the price on Company A. The battery is rated at about 90 minutes for this camcorder, but with an 8GB SD card the camcorder is capable of storing more than 4 hours of HD video, so a second battery makes sense for extended video recording, or simply as a backup. The battery works, but I think a main consideration for anyone thinking about getting a second, proprietary battery for devices these days is how long you intend to use your device or whether the battery is compatible with any other device (lithium-ion batteries can last a long time)."
4228,"It's a Nikon lens shade with a great price ans was delivered super fast. These are very hard to find items, this where you find it with no regrets"
4229,"Bought these to store SD camera cards during travel.  The cards fit very snug inside, and the interior is well designed.  The exterior is a hard, nicely finished plastic, not cheaply made like others I have seen."
4230,"I have owned a whole range of non-Nikon NC filters over the years, and while I haven't done fancy chromatic tests on the images I captured, I can say that whatever coating Nikon has put on this filter it stands up great to dust and occasional finger prints that I have to wipe off. If not from the cost, I do believe the quality is as good as any Nikon optics, and if you've already invested lots in a quality Nikkor lens, why risk putting anything on that may suppress the lens's potential?"
4231,Great protection for a mid-high dollar lens. . . . . . . . . . . .  .. .
4232,"Excellent quality, focus is still sharp (with my Zeikos filter on a 10-20 mm Sigma ultra wide angle lens, I used to observe slight blurriness)"
4233,This is my goto filter that I use on some of my highest quality lenses. I've never had a problem with it and little if any cases of artifacting. Build quality is excellent and the glass is crystal clear.
4234,"I have a line6 Bogner 100 watt tube head. I was having problems with the power tubes, and I looked online and the answer was a power regulator to keep the plate voltages constant.I looked and found this regulator was inexpensive so I got it. I plugged my head into it and wow, what a difference. It has way more power and crunch then before. I am totally sold. Everyone that plays a tube amp needs one of these!!!"
4235,"I needed a 25 ft ethernet cable, this fit's the bill for a great price"
4236,I have this hooked from the Sub out from the stock harmon kardon amp in my 09 subaru legacy and to my aftermarket sub amp in my trunk. sounds perfect never given me problems
4237,Well made.  Gives you the option to position your strobe and umbrella exactly where you need them. Good fit and smooth action. A great improvement over the ball/clamp fitting I was previously using.
4238,"There's a reason Pelican is the go-to name in cases and protection.  I use this to protect an expensive dive watch while traveling, Pluck-and-pull foam is easy to modify, but isn't the most durable if you're taking things out and putting them in repeatedly.  I've heard you can plasti-dip the foam but have never tried."
4239,If you want a secure and easy to use hot shoe mount for your flash and light stands then this is the product to have. Easily adjusts to all hot shoe flash units and is super secure. No slipping or falling out of this mount.
4240,"Protects my new Tamron lens, and arrived very quickly, in spite of my selecting the cheapest/slowest shipping method."
4241,"This thing folds down nice and compact. Bring it along wherever, and it might make that mediocre shot of yours something so much better. Or if nothing else, have it keep you mildly dry in a downpour."
4242,"I ordered this for my Canon 55-250mm telephoto lens.  The lens fit nicely with an extra inch on top of the bag to pull on the string and close the bag.  The material is thick, soft, and stretchy.  Now I can throw my extra lens in my bag without having to worry about it being scratched anywhere.MZ Photo shipped quick in less than 3 days."
4243,I received the product within the time it was offered. The product works very good and the price was very good as well. I did not have any problem with this purchase.
4244,"This is the second BT-446 battery I've ordered. I got scammed on the first one because it was a fake but Company A refunded my money. I bought this one and it was identical to the original battery that came with the phone. I installed it, let it charge and now I get almost the same talk time on the cordless as when I first bought the phone. This is the OEM battery and really the only one you should buy as a replacement for the original Uniden BT-446. I am completely satisfied with this battery."
4245,"I spent a lot of time on the internet trying to find a replacement.Most of the places that I checked did not have it. Some of them had the whole power assembly, battery charger, etc.  Very expensive.  Canon dot com didn't even have it.  Was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Company A.Thank You Company A !!  Bob :-)"
4246,"I bought two  of these to provide some extra RAM to an old powerbook G4. I don't use that laptop a lot, but either way, 2GB is better than the 512 MB it used to have. So, in a way, these ram modules can help in reviving your old laptop just a little bit.I have no complains. The laptop felt slightly faster; very slightly, as I'm now used to a newer macbook with 16GB of RAM, so 2GB is like going back to the stone age for me.What else can I say? this ram modules are good quality, and probably good enough for your old laptop."
4247,"This is a much disparaged lens by many on the Nikon Forums...but I am not sure how many of those complainers took the time to exchange their lens for a better one. There appears to be a tremendous amount of sample variation for this lens. It took me three lenses until I found one that is tack sharp --And WOW!....On my D700, I use it for almost all my shots now -- and I've tried all the other ""pro"" lenses in this focal range as well, NIkon and 3rd Party.I'm find the lens has great range for walk-around purposes and for event shoots. It renders colors brilliantly, and it is sharp with very little putzing around needed with your settings. Half of the shots at my website at RonAnnArbor at [...] in the D700 gallery are taken with the 24-120. I will bet you can't tell which were taken with it, and which were taken with the Nikon 24-70.I would highly recommend this lens -- but I would also add the caveat that you have to be persistent. If you get a lens and it is soft - exchange for a new one, and try again. You will eventually find a really sharp lens that you will be very happy with. I am very happy with mine, even though I was also one of the original disparagers of the lens at first!...."
4248,"It might seem a little odd to write a review now (October  2008) on a camera I bought over 4 years ago (March 2004), but I am just so impressed with the Fuji S5000's performance over the years. We have used this camera almost daily in our business (to take product photos) and for personal use, including trips around the US, Europe, and South America.This camera had many advanced features for when it was made that still hold up today:* Sharp 3.1 MP Image (prints up to 8 x 10)* Great 10x Zoom Lens (really sharp pictures)* Movie and Sound Capture* Great Battery LifeSure, you can get higher end cameras now but I wouldn't hesitate to get one of these used for a backup or ""beater"" camera for the kids.Simply a great, reliable camera that has held up well over time."
4249,"these bic america rtr1530 speakers are as good as expensive speakers.  You say ""how can they be as good as my speakers?  i spent 10 times the money so mine must be better.""not really, you just overpaid.  i dont think these are cheapos, i just think the audio industry wants us to believe we have to spend hundreds of dollars to get quality and its not true.so if overpaying makes you think your speakers sound better, go for it."
4250,I have been playing with lighting for a long time and this has been a great addition to my stash!  Works every time unlike some on the market.
4251,"Pros: They work. Feel sturdy, as compared to manufacturers that use a cheaper PCB.  Good price for 1gig or memory.Cons: None, so far.Other Thoughts: I bought this to go with my new Pentium D 930 and an ASUS P5P800-VM mobo. BUT, after installing everything I noticed that these sticks of mem' are NOT on ASUS's ""DDR Qualified Vendors List"". Now, Kingston IS on the list, but not this model #. It would be helpful to know this BEFORE I bought it all and opened it. Anyway, they work."
4252,"Now I can move various cameras, and camcorders from tripod to shoulder rig in half the time!Well made piece of equipment.  I'll most likely make future purchases of this item."
4253,"This lens is super crisp and sharp for macro, bought this thing used from KEH, was a little reluctant about buying some used camera equipment at first but I got to think about it, digital camera equipment isn't cheap so I'm pretty sure that whoever owned this thing before probably took good care of it, the thing was probably in better shape that the rating that KEH was giving it, it came with the original box and case for it and hood, was in excellent shape and very clean, first thing I did was buy a filter for it and mounted the lens on my 5-D. Again, super sharp and clear pictures, very crisp colors, and as far as buying used equipment, won't hesitate to buy from KEH, saved about $ 350.00 off the original price and received it 4 days later with a 6 months warranty. :)"
4254,"I have found this to be one of my better non-L lens.  Very sharp, very clean, very useful.  I found myself using this more than my 50mm F/1.4"
4255,"As a major enthusiast, but fairly new to the SLR world, I LOVE this lens! It's an all around fun lens for portraits and creative depth of field shots. I highly recommend."
4256,"I own 3 50mm 1.4 lenses from different manafactures. This Canon is bar far my favorite, I kept it even though I no longer own a canon camera. I use it it on my other cameras with an adapter and never fails me. Great lens"
4257,The Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 is a great lense.  I got some terrific pictures but am still learning to use it.
4258,I have read all the reviews about manual focus etc... It didn't seem as difficult as some made it out to be. You definitely need patience and a good image stacking program would be helpful as well. There are plenty of long reviews out there about the technical end of the lens. I love it and would buy it again if the need arose.
4259,"This works great. I use this and a Sto-Fen. Sto-Fen is better in some instances, especially if speed is needed or switching from plain flash and diffused flash is needed quickly.But if you plan to keep a bounce / diffuser on through out shoot, then this does the job.As far as the velcro tabs go on Flash, don't do it.Get the Velcro strap for it, orI think a Sto-Fen (do an Company A search for it) that you trim the top off and stick Velcro stickers to the Sto-Fen would work better than strap.It would be more stable and less prone to slipping.Also in those times that you need to prep everything and start shooting quickly. You could get the mod'd Sto-Fen on faster than the strap and get shooting in half the time. Yes we are talking seconds faster but that could mean the difference of a great shot or no shot."
4260,"I cut one of these up to make a microphone cable, the conductors are a little thing, but a twelve feet its fine for passing audio to headphones or speakers."
4261,"Over a year ago I settled on a Canon Rebel XT digital SLR, but reviews said the Canon 18-55mm kit lens wasn't up to snuff. One of my main considerations was taking action photos in poorly lit high school gyms for my daughter's volleyball team. The Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 filled the bill. At roughly $350, it was the fastest lens I could afford with a reasonable zoom range. In 2005 I took at least 1500 indoor action photos at F2.8 to f3.2 at around 1/250th without a flash. This year I made every game and took nearly 5000. The Tamron lens continues to perform as well as it did when it was new. With an Epson Photo R1800 printer, I've printed 13""X19"" enlargements for the girls, with no loss in quality. An advantage of the no-flash shooting is that you're less obtrusive, and officials will allow you to get closer to the action. It's also a great way to get a lot of candids of facial expressions and quieter moments between action without an attention getting flash. I highly recommend this lens for the purpose I put it to. There are better lenses out there, but they cost a heckuva lot more. In a little over 1 year I've taken nearly 10,000 photos of all types, and the lens is still going strong!"
4262,"how long does a cable review need to be? It works right out of the box. Nice color, the fit is tight on both ends, the cable tie is color coordinated which is a nice touch. The Camera interfaces with the laptop just like you would want from even the most expensive, engineered boutique line of cables.Now after my tongue in cheek review let me assure you that the cable is great and I rely on it almost daily."
4263,"GREAT BUY, NO HASSLE, LONG ENOUGH CABLES, WAS VERY CONTENT WITH MY PURCHASE, WILL RECOMMEND FOR SURE. THANKS THANKS THANKS"
4264,"This item worked as described. For a casual user it will do what you want it to. For me, that was to connect my computer to the stereo across the room to play music on the hard drive.It isn't the heaviest gauge out there but better than some. It has worked for me and I'm not the most careful consumer. The cord gets wound up when not in use and been kinked a few times. Its been stepped on by the dog, and has even suffered an ccasional chair leg being set on it. Still transports the music just fine.I rate it a buy."
4265,"I own a couple of APC UPS and surge protection products.  So far this is the most functional.  The features:1. The unit can be positioned vertically (best for saving space) or horizontally (lay flat or mounted to a server rack).2. It has a very excellent boxy design that gives an elegant and modern feel.3. There are 8 outlets in total (6 outlets are battery protected and voltage regulated, which means less dependency on the battery and longer replacement life; 2 outlets are surge-protected for printers and office machines).4. The included PowerChute Personal Edition is to be combined with the data cable that, when connected to your computer via USB, provides excellent control and communication between the UPS, computer and user/administrator.a. You will know exactly how much load is taxing the UPS in real-time; Turn on/off equipment to check.b. Shut-down function to preserve data or battery.c. Audible and visual alarm indication on current condition.5. Hot-swap battery without turning off the UPS.The cons?  Heavy!  But then of course it only needs to be set and forget.  Expensive!  Not for a typcial user.  Although the features should be made available for everyone.This particular model is a little overkill.  I connected a P4 3GHz (with 3 internal SATA HDD, DVDROM, DVD-RW), 21&quot; CRT, Apple PBG4 laptop, 2 external LaCie HDD and 1 external CD-R and I still haven't reached half of the available power.  Buy this only if they offer a special price/rebate.  Otherwise, go with the lower model XS/RS1000 and it will suite an power user just perfectly."
4266,Good replacement battery.  Things wear out and you must have a good battery.  Works just as advertized.
4267,I just bought the ipod photo 20gb yesterday and had to get one of these also. This thing is so cool its like having a 100 disc changer with you whenever you travel. Just hook it up to the ipod and bang there you go. Sometimes this thing picks up interference but to me its no big deal. Sounds good to me and Ill take it everywhere I go.
4268,I ordered the hood hat for my Samsung camera and it is working great. It is especially helpful to have them for the lens as I lost the lens cap to one of my lens shortly before I ordered this hood.  It's working well keeping my lens protected!
4269,"FIFTY ASA!!!!!!!! I can't believe this stuff is legal. It's so testy you either better be shooting at the sun or using a tripod that weighs more than a Japanese pop-singer. The detail is ludicrous.  Please dont waste this high quality stuff on a point and shoot. It deserves to be exposed through some really nice glass. I'd hate to see this stuff in a Nikon. (just a lil' jab at the Nikon afficiando's, I'm a Contax man myself (zeiss or die bitches!!!!).The sharpness is absolutely terrifying. IT's like taking a folding razor to jello."
4270,"I recently got a new laptop for use at university and wanted a good way to carry it around. A lot of my friends in our computer science department and other people too, including my girlfriend, had these ugly big laptop bags that had about 20 inches of ultra ballistic padding in them. I decided that was not what I wanted to drag around campus with me, so I started looking at backpacks with built in notebook holders. I checked out Best Buy and was disgusted at the prices, so I checked here. I found this nice one from Kensington and saw that it was via Circuit City, so I went to the store today to check it out. This thing is pretty awesome - I reall ylike the MP3 player pocket with the line out spot, and also it has a nice ammound of padding and is really comfy. I'm ordering it tonight, really looking forward to it showing up!"
4271,"If you have $4000 plugged into one outlet why not spend a few bucks an get surge protection? I've only had one since but hell this is a great value. Brick and mortar would cost you twice as much for equal protection. I bought the big one with internet filter, cable and more."
4272,It is a great product. It works quite well. It has a long enough cord to be useful. God Buy.
4273,"I'm very happy with this item's performance and design.  The main reason that I chose this one is that it has ten outlets.  Considering the number of peripherals that need to be separately plugged in for a computer system these days, plus a few extra items with chargers that I like to plug in while I'm at the computer, having that many available slots is wonderful.I also like that they arranged the outlets intelligently, with gaps to permit the insertion of the larger plugs that some electronic devices require."
4274,"I bought a 6"" Orion Dobsonian so that I could encourage my 7-year-old's interest in the stars and planets.  I love the scope, but found the red dot finder that comes with it to be almost useless.  I have no experience with telescopes, but talked to a friend who is very active in his local astronomy club and he recommended this.I couldn't be happier with it- I attached it to the telescope, aimed the telescope at a distant tree, and aligned the finder with the telescope all in about 2 minutes.  Then waited for nightfall and was able to instantly go to any object that I wanted to see.  This is so easy to use that I was able to teach my 7-year-old and her 5-year-old sister how to aim the telescope with it.If you're having problems aiming a telescope, this is the simple solution.  The only downside, as others have mentioned, is the size of the device.  That's not an issue on my telescope, which is about 5' long, but it could be an issue wtih small telescopes.To further enhance this, find star maps designed for it.  Some are available for printing on the internet, you can also order them from the company.  Having the Telrad's ""targets"" on a map helped me quickly and easily find a couple of Messier objects that otherwise would have eluded me."
4275,"Works great with my ReplayTV Panasonic Showstopper 2000.  This is the only remote I've seen that has all the ReplayTV buttons.  Matches perfectly.  Allows advanced features like the tech screen (243+zones button).  My dog ate the last remote, same model."
4276,"Did I say it was very comfortable?? :)I bought this mouse about 6months ago and I didn't have to replace the battery yet!!! Amazing! and i use it 5 to 6 hours a day! I suffered from carpal tunnel syndrom and my doctor recommended I buy this Microsoft mouse. Since i started using this mouse, i don't feel any discomfort from using my computer. And because it was designed by Microsoft, i had no compatability issues with my computer."
4277,"I've owned this product about a month now, and it works great!!  Easy to use, once you get used to that little red button that you have to move around and then push for five different functions.  I jog with it almost daily, and haven't had any problems with it.  The battery doesn't last the 18 hours or whatever they say, but the battery does last several hours, and longer than my previous portable MP3 player.  I like the functions, and the light-up display is nice for when you're jogging at night.  I put in a 64MB card, but I've read it holds larger cards than that.  The software is fair, not exactly intuitive, but fairly easy to use and definitely gets the job done.  I've even plugged it into the auxiliary port on my parent's Honda Goldwing and it played perfectly thru the motorcycle's stereo system.  The wrist/arm strap is fairly high quality, and it even comes in a plastic &quot;slipcase&quot; to keep the player off your body when you're wearing it.  The ear buds - well, I'd just have to agree with prior comments on those - I just use my sport headphones.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this item."
4278,"Have a USB wireless adapter that, when plugged into my laptop, is too big to allow use of the adjacent USB port.  The adapter also sticks out too far and I have almost broken it off at times.  With this right angle adapter, I was able to mount the wireless adapter to the back of the display (using Velcro tape).  Now I can use all my USB ports, and the adapter gets a better signal!"
4279,"I purchased this adapter because we only have 1 phone line in the house and also only 1 phone jack.  In order to plug in the phone line, the DSL line, and the home security line into the phone jack, I needed something like this; this little gadget fit the bill perfectly.  Have had it plugged into the phone jack with 3 lines running to it, and have never experienced any problems whatsoever.  Would recommend if you're in a predicament similar to mine."
4280,"I've got two of these, running for several months now.  Not a single problem."
4281,"It did the job.  Only made a few cables, but it worked like a charm.  Seems to be well made."
4282,high qulaity item that is verry useful with technician or electrician. never you will miss your money after that so goooooooo
4283,"The memory came before I expected it. The box was clean, packaging was perfect. All paper work included. Very happy with the performance of the PNY 2 gigs of ram. Would purchase again without hesitation from Company A and this company."
4284,"need to improve my old Pentium 4, this new memory works perfectly with my old memory, now my computer is going to work a few years"
4285,"WOW!  What a great price for this brand new XD card!  I had no problems with it and still don't.  Don't go to you department store, buy it here and save money!"
4286,This lens cover is exactly like the one that came with my 18-70mm kit lens.  I had several sales people try and sell me a different brand saying they could not get this cap.  I'm very happy with the transaction.
4287,I put this in an old Midnight that had 1.1 ports only.  Has really helped me save time when transferring data to some external hard drives on it.
4288,"I have one of these and also one of B+W XS-Pro UV Haze MRC Nano filters.B+W 77mm XS-Pro Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating (010M)Construction and clarity is excellent and I've not experienced vignetting on a 70-200mm on a cropped sensor.  I will be experimenting on a full-frame today and will update if there are issues.While this filter is fantastic, for an extra $30-40, I prefer the XS-Pro Nano version, even if vignetting is not an issue on your camera/lens.  The nano coating noticeably less reflective when comparing off camera.  Some of this will translate to better contrast in the final image.  If you have the extra money, and you probably do if you're looking at filters of this quality, get the nano:B+W 77mm XS-Pro Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Nano Coating (010M)"
4289,"Sure, you can find a cheaper filter... but this is one of those cases where you do indeed get what you pay for.  B&W filters have rightly earned a reputation for quality workmanship and optical clarity, and this one is no exception.  The coating performs beautifully.  I have several of these in different sizes and am well pleased with all of them.  If you've got a high-end lens, don't diminish your image quality with a cheap filter.  And it goes without saying that if the front of your lens takes a bump, it's easier to replace a $50 filter than it is to replace the front glass of your lens.  Recommended!"
4290,"I have one of these B&W; UV filters for all my lens.- The clarity and fit is exceptional. it doesn't change the image quality at all. Don't cheap out on lower quality glass.- Offers excellent protection against lens damage and is super easy to clean- Lens cap fits perfectly over this, but i often leave the cap off when shooting pictures out and aboutFor about 20-30$, it can protect an investment worth hundreds. Highly recommend for all your lens!"
4291,"As I have mentioned in all of my other B+W filter postings, this is one of the top filter manufacturers in the world. The glass is top quality Schott Glass and the ring is made of brass to help prevent seizing.In general, this filter is designed to help eliminate reflections and glare, remove ""blue-cast"" in photos and, in so doing, it can help increase color saturation. Aside from the basic UV/haze filter, the polarizer is likely the filter you will use most frequently. If you are going to spend good money on a lens, spend the extra money and get good quality filters.For those that have not used a polarizer before, the outer ring will rotate the glass because there is an optimal angle for it to work - you may need to experiment with the filter attached, or do little research to get the hang of it.Note: This is NOT the SLIM version, so if you use it with a wide-angle lenses there is a potential of Vignetting. On the plus side, because there are threads on the outside of the filter, any standard lens cap (not included) will work and stay attached a lot better than the one on the slim filter."
4292,"Wow!  So this is how the pros get all those phenomenal outdoor photos.  This polarizer gives you the freedom to cut a good deal of the reflected light out of your shots, which saturates colors and reduces contrast in a way I didn't think was possible with a single exposure.  Literally every shot I take outdoors looks so good, with great saturation and amazing dynamic range, it's as though I spent hours carefully compiling an HDR image from a dozen exposures.  This photography hobby just keeps getting better and better."
4293,"Very hesitant to buy this for my April 2011-purchased Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD and 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens due to the reviews that said it basically doesn't fit the threads correctly.  I've had extremely good experience with Company A's terrific customer support in the past, though, so figured if it didn't fit, I'd just send it back with no problems.  Luckily for me, it did fit my lens just fine!  Took a minute or two to get the threading correct, but once I did it fit & threaded with no problems.  I don't know if someone somewhere started either making the filter's or the len's threading to better specifications, but it does seem to fit my lens that I received with my recently purchased camera.  Cheers!"
4294,This is a great lens cap.  It has a snug fit and is a great backup cover when you lose your original cap.
4295,"I needed a tripod that would fit in my camera bag with ease. A professional photographer buddy of mine, suggested this unit. I love it. It makes those long exposure shots easy when you don't have a steady hand. Get this, you won't regret it."
4296,"This is the best case I've ever used. I researched all the cases out there, and this one had the right intersection of features, and attractive appearance. It seems that all cases these days with decent features look like they came straight out of a raver party. This one only has a pleasing blue led glow from the air intake slots, and while you can disable it, I've left it in since it looks nice.I liked my first one so much I just recently bought a second, when old 1.8GHz computer died and needed an all-round upgrade.I've disabled all the case fans and have Cool N' Quiet on the CPU (and temperature controlled PS fans), so the thing runs very cool (29 degrees right now, never breaks 33 even when running WOW) and very quiet. I've yet to hear the PS fan come on for cooling. There is a temperature gauge that shows both CPU temperature and internal case temperature. On my first machine (which has a massive CPU heat sink/fan) the two temperatures are equal. On the second, the CPU runs 4 degrees hotter than the case.The only annoyance about it is that the fascia is aggravating to remove. I was experimenting with different placements for a DVD burner and had to take the faceplate off four or five times. Sometimes it came off in a snap, sometimes I had to work at it for minutes, and sliced my fingers.Once you get it all set up, though, you won't regret it."
4297,I bought these to extend my PC or stereo with the proper extension in testing them last night they worked great plenty loud enough to do the job seem to be a great choice
4298,Wish it was a bit cheaper it is a piece of plastic after all but after buying some aftermarket crap that didn't work well at all came back to the original cap and haven't looked back since
4299,"I own 3 Canon camers(G2, G12 and 60D) and all have genuine Canon UV protector filters.  Fit and quality is great."
4300,"Subject line says it all -- can't beat the price with this twin pack! One concern I had when getting the Instax was the amount of money I'd have to spend on the film, but luckily I found this so I don't feel too bad about snapping away!"
4301,"I promised myself that as soon as SLR digitals got below $1000, I'd get one.  I saw this at Best Buy and bought it on the spot.  (Should have waited and bought on Company A cheaper).  This camera rocks.  I've used several so called &quot;point and shoot&quot; digital cameras by Olympus and Nikon and this one is much easier to use.  Auto focus is amzingly fast and accurate.  Auto flash detection.  Swapable lenes with my older film Rebel.  Battery lasts me well over 150 shots on one charge.  Amazing picture quality.Do not spend $500-$600 on some lower end digital camera with a fixed lens.  This is the real deal.  Look at the reviews...perfect!  This will be the last digital you'll ever need unless you go pro.  Buy it, Buy it, Buy it."
4302,Added this lens hood to protect my newly purchased Canon 10-22mm lens- which also was a great Company A buy. I hadn't used one of these hoods prior to the purchase of this lens and also my 17-55mm lens.  What is a few more dollars when you are spending close to $1000 for a lens.  I highly recommend.
4303,this is an awesome camera! i can't wait to start taking photos and to start my business in photography! i am excited and its in great condition!!!!
4304,"I've been using this for almost two years with all manner of external Firewire 400 devices and MacBook Pros and it's been a real champ. Alas, last week I ""lost"" it so I've ordered two more--one to keep at my Company K and one for my travel bag."
4305,"Have owned these now for a year and a half and I have to say they have proven themselves on multiple occasions.First off, the 'fit kit' that comes with them has NINE different shapes and sizes of earpeices, so chances are that they will fit you. I personally prefer the black flexible earpieces, as they don't put too much pressure on your ears like the clear ones do. The foam ones are nice too but they are very tedious to put in and wear out very quickly.These are great for any situation where ambient noise is an issue. I haven't yet encountered a situation wher I have had to turn my ipod above about 60% volume to be able to clearly hear my music.The best feature of all though is the superb sound quality compared with the cheap white earbuds that come with the ipod. The sound is very clear and has a very full range, unlike the cheap ones which are almost all midrange tones. These definitely have a very full bass range, but not overpowering. After I got these, I started noticing new parts of my music that I never had before (subtle basslines, background vocals, etc.) My musical experience has definitely been enhanced.I have abused these earbuds to no end. I pretty much threw out the case and just leave them wrapped around my ipod in coat pockets, backpacks, etc. The worst thing that has happened so far is that one of the rubber earpieces fell off while I was on the bus, but it was about time to change them anyways. Very durable.Overall, the initial cost is high, but these are definitely worth the extra cost for the durability alone (I probably would have gone through 3 cheap sets by now). The only reason I would tell someone not to buy these is that they block out ALL noise (including phones in the office and oncoming traffic), while cheap earbuds allow most of this noise to come through."
4306,"You won't regret purchasing these premium quality earphones.  I had been using the Sony sound-isolating one's (where the cord fell apart every few months), and gave up, spent the extra money on this wonderful set.I couldn't be happier.  The advertising on this set is true - you really do 'hear sounds you've never heard before'.I agree with all other 5 star comments - sound, comfort, durability, it's all here.  The sound is so crisp, and the bass levels were fine for me (strong, dependent on your equalizer).A piece of advice:  if you are going to use these for an iPod or MP3 device, the sound will be amazing, but not as good as it could be with CD quality source music.  Just bear that in mind!"
4307,It works straight out of the box no formatting required in a Sony DSC-S70 camera. So if you have an older Sony product that supports the old MagicGate memory stick this is a great buy.
4308,"I had been always curious about the Pocket PC OS and its usefulness and practicality on the PDA environment.  I am now a believer and definitely prefer it over the Palm OS due to its ease of use, compatibility and similarity to the Windows PC environment.  This also results in a faster learning curve.Integrated wireless:This was the selling factor, and it did not dissapoint me.  I got it to work at home and at the office, where I connect to different wireless access points.  The iPAQ allows you to create individual profiles for every connection, so there is no need to manually configure every time you switch networks.Bluetooth:This technology is becoming more common around airports, offices, malls and other places, although probably you'll need to incur in a connection fee.  I have not tested this feature yet although my iPAQ recently came across and recognized a Bluetooth network on one of the airports I travelled to.Synchronization:The iPAQ supports Outlook (preferably 2002) for Calendar, e-mail, notes, file and task synching.  The Active Synch software is included and required on your host PC in order to start synchronizing with your PDA.  A maximum o 2 PCs (partnerships) can be established for synching.  Methods of synchronization include IR(Infrared), USB(using the included cradle), WLAN (yes, you can synch wireless) or serial.Word and Excel documents are automatically converted into Pocket PC format when they are synchronized with the iPAQ.  The original document needs to be copied into the Pocket PC folder (Pocket_PC My Documents) on your host PC before performing the synch.Internet:In order to connect to the Internet, you are required to be connected to a network, be it WLAN or Bluetooth.  There are a few interesting web links included with your iPAQ and you can add your own favorites as well.  Navigations is similar to Internet Explorer although you are required to scroll up/down and left/right continously on web sites that are not mobile-friendly.E-mails:E-mail accounts on the iPAQ are setup in an almost exact manner as Outlook on a normal PC.  By default, and in order to conserve memory, e-mail attachments are not downloaded, there's also a default limit of e-mails you can carry at a time.  E-mails can be downloaded while connected to the Internet or synched using the methods mentioned previously.What about games? Two games are included: Guess what? Solitaire is one of them! The other one is Jawbreaker, a very simple but extremely entertaining game.  There are many web sites with additional programs that can be downloaded for your iPAQ.Programs and utilities included:MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player, Pocket Excel and Word, Pocket MSN, Microsoft Reader, Calculator, Terminal Services Client among others.Security:Password security is optional; there are two security options, a simple 4-digit number and a more complex alphanumeric password option.  Wireless connection security is obtained using 64 or 128 bit WEP encryption.  Obviously your PDA is as secure as the network it is connecting to.  Setting up 128 bit encryption on your iPAQ won't work if your wireless access point is unsecured.Time settings: Up to two different time zones are available at the same time.Display:Very clear display, sharp, easy to read text, adjustable text size and fonts in some programs.Battery:The iPAQ possesses a respectable battery duration.  It obviously varies according to your battery saving settings.  Reducing the default screen brightness helps as well as turning off the wireless access or lowering the sound volume.Settings:You can monitor memory usage and power consumption, remove programs, adjust backlight settings, align the screen, sharpen the text, etc.Other features:Voice recording: There's a button on the upper left corner of the iPAQ to start recording short messages or reminders, very handy.MP3 audio: MP3 files can be downloaded and played on your PDA using Windows Media Player.  A headphone jack is also available for your private listening pleasure.  Memory is limited though, is not like you can have a CD full of music on your iPAQ, don't confuse it with an MP3 player.Letter Recognizer - A very cool option where the iPAQ attempts to recognize your handwriting and converts it into readable text.Block recognizer - It's similar to the Palm's graffiti recognitionTranscriber - It recognizes words written in cursiveNotes can also be quickly handwritten as if using the iPAQ as a paper Notepad.Images can also be viewed using your iPAQ, and as with the MP3 files, you should consider the memory limitations.Memory:Additional memory can be obtained with Secured Digital (SD) memory cards.  These come on 128, 256 and 512MB sizes at reasonable prices.The HP iPAQ 4155 is a complete, full-featured piece of equipment, well worth its price."
4309,"I was very skeptical buying this gamepad after buying the ideazon zboard.  I had a horrible time programming the zboard, and didn't feel it enhanced my game experience whatsoever.  I decided to buy this product purely by word of mouth from other gamers who swear by the n52.This controller I have primarily used to play World of Warcraft with.  The two classes I've played it with are a priest and a rogue.The n52 has a lot of buttons and initially feels very clunky.  The buttons were initially stiff, the scroll button is practically useless and the big orange button would move the entire controller unless I held the entire thing down.  This controller initially felt no different than using a regular keyboard and modifying the buttons to your liking.The innovation of this product though is in the software.  You can install and start programming macros, spamming buttons, character templates, and button combinations with ease.  There wasn't any need for me to read the instructions on how to do this; it was that simple.When I played with my rogue I noticed I would down mobs noticably faster since I could spam my combo attacks and finishing moves.  When timed, my overall attack time improved by 1.35 seconds on an even level mob.  I did not try my rogue on a pvp game, just on regular enemies.When I played with my priest, I noticed I could spam spells faster than I ever could before. With the right healing macros in place with the controller macros, I could keep an entire group of people up in battlegrounds and raids with just one button press.  When playing pvp battlegrounds, players on the opposing side ended up targeting me because I was throwing out heals faster than they could terminate the players I was keeping up.  I ended up getting most kills alliance side as well, despite being disc/holy spec (holy priests are known for being squishy).  This is mostly due to being able to spam spells faster than they could heal, or kill me.Actually using the n52 while pvping was at first a challenge because I didn't know how to streamline the macros.  While I initially thought the three buttons available for just my thumb was going to be worthless, I ended using them more than ever.  The big orange button has now become my spam/kill button, the d-pad for targeting, and the space bar-like bottom button for jumping.  After streamlining how I wanted my spells and configuration to be, I was owning at raiding and pvping.There are keyboards out on the market right now that call themselves gamer ones (i.e. Logitech, Microsoft).  They have macro command functions similar to this one, but usually the macro keys are in an akward place on the keyboard. Most people don't use the macro buttons due to their inefficiency.  This controller despite being clunky, is the only one on the market right now that gives you a easy and time-saving method of programming and adjusting macros and keystrokes to what you want.Despite the n52's shortfalls, (stiffness, badly placed scroll button) I have to say that if you are interested in pvp on WoW or any other pvp MMORPG, you should definately look into purchasing this controller.  A lot of the ""legendary"" pvpers are good because they kill quickly and efficiently.  Most people blame great pvpers for being good because of their excellent gear, being a certain class, cheating etc.  All they really do though is use this controller.  It's just that good.UPDATE:  12 Dec 2006 - I've been using the N52 for about 6 months now and am completely addicted to it.  I love this pad so much I've bought a couple for my gamer friends.  If they don't have one, they already know what I'm getting for them for Christmas.The pad's buttons have gotten a thorough working in.  The stiffness has since worn away form the keys and now feels like a old school nintendo power glove.  I moved the adjustable handrest back, and now use the row below the preforated arrow keys on the pad in order to move.  This gives me a bigger arsenal of buttons to use with less quirky movements and the ability to smoothly use the scroll button (which can be used as buttons as well).  I haven't found much use for the programming states, which usually ends up complicating my already complicated set-up.  The orange button still does suck, as you have to hold the controller down in order to press it, though I've learned to adpat my style in order to use it quickly."
4310,"Used in a sealife underwater camera housing. they fit in all the little corners perfectly. I have recieved previous packages (from other sellers) that were already pink (exposed) when I opened the package for the first time. These were very blue, as they should be. Small, light, and good absorbers."
4311,"I purchased one of these to store pictures for the Canon Powershot A610 5MP Digital Camera. That camera comes with a paltry 16 MB SD memory card which held about 10 or 12 pictures.  Whether you're getting a camera or other electronics purchase requiring memory storage) for yourself or others, you might want to consider including an adequate memory device right fron the beginning.  I've had no problems so far with the Kingston, it has a number of excellent features detailed above, and is fast enough for my purposes, and is very reasonably priced. For beginners without demands fo larger or faster memory systems, this is an inexpensive good bet. Company A sells it much cheaper than the big discount electronic stores, such as the one in California that starts with an ""F.""  That store sold it for far more money, it took me 25 minutes to find the memory section, and then they didn't even have one of these."
4312,"The Olympus DM-10 is incredible. It is unlike anything you have ever used before. The sound at HQ & Stereo HQ recording mode is outstanding. During a lecture, you can sit in the back and record, and what you play back is 100% understandable. Even the SP and LP modes will record clearly, but you probably won't use it, because SHQ and HQ will spoil you. As an MP3 music player, I think it sounds better than a portable CD player. My DM-10 came with stereo earphones (earbuds) and a stereo condenser mike (ME51S). I was reluctant to buy it at first, because of the $150 price tag. But once I got it and started using it, there was no doubt as to why."
4313,It is a very good way to store your CD's and DVD'S.  These were hard to find in other places I had shopped.  Very easy to stack and you can locate what your looking for at a glance if you properly identify them.
4314,"Since all the positive aspects of this player have already been mentioned, I'll just take the time to delve into a few of the less mentioned slightly less glamorous aspects of this player.In using it as a portable hard drive, I notice that the transfer rate for this device using USB 2.0 is actually slower than most other flash based mp3 players.  I capped out my transfer rate at around 1 mb/sec.  This ends up making the transfer of large files significantly slower.  Also, the physical hd of the unit spins at around 4200 rpm- so those planning on using this unit to back up files shouldn't expect 7200 rpm speeds off it.For some reason, the scroll rate for the iHp seems a bit slower than it should be, and takes a precious few more seconds to get to a certain peice, but perhaps that problem has been addressed by a firmware upgrade.  Overall, this is still the best player on the market, offering all the functions/size of an iPod minus the horrible copy protection, added a portable hd capability, and a high quality fm tuner that I never use.Speaking of the fm tuner, a direct record method to encode mp3s straight from the radio would have been nice too :)"
4315,"This onkyo cd carousel player replaced an older one in my system. Matches other onkyo pieces, and sounds great. Cost of this item was less than repairing old piece."
4316,I installed the memory in a friends old computer which doubled her ram and increased the speed noticably for her. The memory is working great and the cost and delivery was excellent
4317,Affordable telescope.  It magnifies pretty far and for the amount of $ it costs it is worth it.  I have a wonderful time with mine.
4318,"Best splitter I've ever bought and used.  I was kicking myself when it was temporarily misplaced, which means it's a solid buy for anyone.  Keep in mind, though, that the connectors are 1/8"", not 1/4""."
4319,I purchased the Microsoft wireless 7000 keyboard and mouse and needed a switch that would support a wireless keyboard and mouse since my old switch did not.  This switch worked perfect.
4320,"This is the best USB to 232 converter on the market. Keyspan years ago wrote drivers for this that allow real time peak into data going by. In other words, you get a free Serial Diagnostics tool with it that shows ASCII Binary and hex and all control codes while your own software can communicate to your devices."
4321,"First off, the speakers are gorgeous.  I was blown away by the mirror black surface.Second, they weight 44 pounds a piece!  Quality really does scale with weight.It's interesting that the NS-555 is equipped with the same cone sizes as Yamaha's highest end $2000 Soavo models.  One 1"", one 5"", and two 6.5"".  It must be ideal.The 30Hz - 35kHz is best in class.Without surprise, they hands down beat my Bose car system.If you want ridiculous bass, you obviously need a powered sub.  But you certainly don't need one, especially if you simply add 3dB to your receiver's low-end via the equalizer or ""bass"" adjust.  With the right content, satisfying bass will fill a large room.TV audio is extremely tame and balanced.  The full frequency range is there."
4322,Using this digital cable between a Vista PC and NEC monitor. No issues.
4323,This cable works great. Is thick and long enough for what I needed. I do recommend it to any one.
4324,"The battery arrived in 6 days with standard shipping (very good). It installed easily and works as advertised (so far, so good). I wish this battery carried the 2-year warranty I've seen offered at other retailers in the past, although I've never had to rely on it. I usually get 2+ to 3 years out of these UPS batteries (APC and Belkin). If this one doesn't make it to the 2-year point, I'll definitely update this review."
4325,"This filter works great for viewing a full moon. Eliminates any glare and allows one to see the craters , shadows and light without any interference. A no-brainer if you have an Orion telescope, it may work with other models, I have not checked."
4326,"These are working great. I made the mistake last time by using off-brand batteries. I just assumed they were the same and would save me some money. But, they wore out too fast. Also, the power levels were suspect.Anyway, this time I just sucked it up and bought a brand name. My (two) cordless phones are working great. I've had these phones for about 7 years, and it seems like you need to replace the batteries every year or two. New batteries in a phone make a world of difference, so if you are thinking about getting a new phone but are considering new batteries -- get the new batteries. As far as I'm concerned (based on a lot of personal experience), new batteries is what you need. Almost always in life, you don't need a new &#60;whatever&#62;, you just need to replace the batteries."
4327,"I was looking for an external hard drive to use it for backup and to use it to move files between my Mac and Windows computer. This drive does the job. It comes with a trial of MacDrive 6 for windows, an excellent software to ""see Mac partitions"" on windows machines. I paid $150 for it and I have no complaints yet.Pros:+ Good Price/Storage Capacity+ Small & Portable & Quiet+ 110/220 Volts+ Firewire drives are faster than USB2 drives+ Additional (2 ports) firewire for multiple Firewire connectionsCons:- Software MacDrive 6 is trial only, not full version.- Power brick is not small- Power on switch is on the back and is a little switch, not a button.- Firewire cable is included (+good+) but it's short"
4328,"It's a simple item, so I have a simple comment: does what it has to do, looks how it has to look, endures as long as it has to. Great article!"
4329,This case is great for the price! It fits all my CDs from burned retail software to boxed software that came with various products. The outside of the case is nice and hard -- feels like hard leather. The sleeves inside are great and easy to use. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to store their CDs and keep their CDs organized.
4330,"I looks good, feels good and comfortable to carry around, CDs, DVDs or games fit very well and they do not shift or move out of place."
4331,"I bought my AT PL120 from Company A to transfer my LP collection to CD after my old Dual 1019 turntable died. I chose it over the USB model because of the better quality and flexibility for use with future formats such as SACD. The internal preamp is also a nice feature as phono inputs are becoming extinct on today's home theater receivers.I've copied several LPs so far and am very happy with the results. The turntable is built like a tank, a snap to set up, and sounds good enough with the included cartridge to make me question why I bought the AT440MLa upgrade cartridge. The 440MLa does sound a bit better with high end headphones, but most people would probably be happy with the included cartridge. One bit of advice, however, for those who do plan to upgrade the cartridge. Buy an extra universal headshell unless you are very comfortable working with tiny bolts and wires. Stanton and others make headshells that will work fine and can be found for as little as $12 with a Google search - I ordered the  Stanton H4S Headshell through Company A."
4332,"I got these both a studio headphone to wear while podcasting, check out The Social Media Monster podcast, and to listen to music and other podcasts. They have great quality and tone. Some people have said they are a little big. Well then I must have a big head, because they fit me perfectly. I also love the thicker coiled cord. It is substantial and seem not near as likely to give in to wear and tear as the cord on my last set of headphones did.So, great price, great sound, great quality. I couldn't be happier!"
4333,"For my Canon G9, I tried Case Logic and Tamrac but didn't like the belt loops. Chose this case and it has served me well for 4+ years and 20+ hikes / trips / vacations. Fits the camera perfectly with 1/4"" extra on the sides and 1/2"" on the top along with extra battery (2 extra is a tight fit). Since I use wrist strap, the two zippers can meet in the middle (around the wrist strap).It has never opened up by itself as the zippers are snug when turning the corners at the top. I liked this case so much that I bought an spare. About a year ago, I left my camera somewhere - my buisiness card was in the front pocket and I got lucky and someone returned the camera, card, and battery - but the case wasn't returned. Been using my spare and now I'm buying another spare.It fits the G9 perfectly so when I replaced that camera with a Canon G12 (which is bigger) I thought I would have to look for a bigger case. I bought the Tamrac 5692 which fits perfectly but is 25% bigger than the Rezo 50 and IMHO too big to use on the belt. The G12 does fit in the Rezo 50 but it is a really snug fit especially with an extra battery (forget about 2 extras). I still use this case when I want my G12 on my belt."
4334,"I love Dual's decks! I had my last one for over four years, in 3 different cars. Great product, easy install, sounds way better than stock. You won't regret this one"
4335,"I bought this case to store in an airtight environment 2 pistols in my possession.The warranty alone is worth the purchase... but if you know anything about Pelican cases, you know this:- Lifetime warranty on any defect within the bounds of their terms of use (that means you can't abuse it and expect to get a brand new one for free)- USA made (hard to come by)- Made out of Military-grade plastics and polymers (means you could abuse it, and it would still be intact)- Waterproof with a pressure-valve that equalizes internal pressure should it submerse in water.This can snugly hold two pistols and 1-3 extra magazines EACH + A small area for accessories, grips, and a desiccant gel pack."
4336,This is just what we needed to charge our digital camera batteries.  Perfect condition and genuine OEM Nikon product.  Have used it from the day we received it and took it out of the box.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for this brand/type of charger.
4337,"It's hit or miss if a Canon lens will include the hood. The place that I ordered the lens from didn't say anything about the hood being included. So I went ahead and ordered the hood from Company A so I had it when the lens arrived. The authoritative site is Canon's site and check what is included in the box for any given lens. Naturally the lens hood was included, so I ended up selling this for a loss.Anyway... yes. You can buy a cheaper knock-off lens hood for about half the price. However a lens hood is not a decorative object just stuck on the end of your lens to make your lens look big. It IS serving a purpose. You want to reduce flare on a capture, so you're attempting to eliminate stray light hitting the lens surface. Buy a cheap Chinese knock-off hood, and what do you see? A nicely polished glossy interior to the hood. Canon's hood has a flocking on the interior of the hood which is designed to cut down on the light hitting the lens surface."
4338,"There is no better crop sensor lens for a Nikon dslr. You will be blown away, so go for the big price tag because it is worth every penny. I might recommend that you get the best experience by pairing this with a D7000 or D7100 with a grip for pro ergonomics."
4339,"I own two SB800's and an SB600 that I use with my D200 and D300, overall the flash is good.  I will say that the Nikon Creative Lighting system is not great, I have had several issues where it ends up putting out too much light or not enough light, basically it ends up being inconsistent.  In the end, I usually end up using the flashes in Manual remote mode, meaning that I set the flash output from the commander.  I have gotten some great pictures from these flashes, and they work at quite a distance from the camera.  Overall a great product.On a side note, I decided to go with the SB800's instead of the 600's because of the flash sync port, that allows me to plug the flash into my flash sync port on my camera to ensure that it goes off when I need it to.  Also the ability to use a battery pack with the flash is another added benefit.  I have not gotten an external battery pack for it yet, but I am looking forward to that.Finally, I just love being able to use AA's, because I can get a lot of rechargeable ones of those as opposed to the specialized batteries that my SB50 uses."
4340,I needed this to transfer my mini dv to hard drive. The Sony video cam had this 4 pin connection and luckily my Midnight 1525 had it too. I can burn dvd after transfer and make my movies. Works great. No loss of clarity during the transfer. Great price!
4341,"I've had this scanner for a week now and it still surprizes me. When on a road trip I picked up my local police from 50 miles from my town. My other scanners don't pick them up after about 10 miles. It's also compatable with ECAS Trunked System, which is the main reason I baught this scanner. It also gets rid of the anoying beeps at the end of each trasmission of the fire and police. Also great feature is the conectivty of the scanner to your computer makes programing very easy. I would recomend this scanner for any beginner or advanced radio scanner listener."
4342,"Too many times my kids have forgotten to plug in their ipods for updating/recharging.  Although you can't update, you can use this car charger and still play the tunes.  It has been great as a stop-gap!"
4343,"We used to use the cheap battery chargers!  Didn't know there was anything different until I came across this product when ordering Ansmann batteries.  After much research, I ordered another brand (not really cheaper, just like the description), the whole house would stink, obviously something wrong with the unit, returned it and purchased this Ansmann.  Unbelievable battery life after using this charger.  Everyone who uses rechargable batteries should own one of these!!!"
4344,A little larger than i anticipated but it works great.  The base makes this product &#34;stand out&#34; over other types.
4345,Bought to clean photo slides and it works well.Well designed and high quality product. I have it on my desk and use it often just to clean the key board. A little weak compared with compressed air cans but often will do the job.Great product Good Price. Also it looks nice and funky ...Would buy again
4346,"It blows, but that's what I need it to do. If you don't have a rocket blower, get this one. The small one is pretty ineffective. Go big or go home."
4347,"Anyone who has a DSLR needs one of these! Works great for blowing dust out of any crivas in your camera. Convenient, powerful and works!"
4348,"Good for cleaning dust from LP filters, loose sensor dust and from other far to reach places. Powerful blower. Nice solid build. A bit large for carrying around though."
4349,...it's waay expensive... but I can't give a bad rating on a perfectly performing product based on price. The MSRP is not the retailer's fault... the charger works flawlessly and the whoppingly expensive battery for said charger seems to be very happy. I can't complain really so I give this a 5 as there are so many 4 and below products out there it's great to see companies make great products...
4350,"Know what you want before purchasing these speakers.  I listen mostly to Roy Orbison and similar music.  Three way speakers with clear mid-range is what I wanted and is what I got.  Beautiful sound.  Not bad bass.  Much better than I expected.  I added a sub-woofer to make sure I could hear everything.  I love LPs because they are what I grew up with and they sound fantastic on these speakers.  Back in the day I had a pair of the exotic Dalquist 5 way speakers.  Even though that has been many years ago I still remember how they sounded.  So, I still compare speakers with them.  And no, the Yamahas don't sound as good, but close enough for these old ears of mine."
4351,"A bit pricey, but it does the job. Its amazing the difference you get in your photos just by positioning your flash differently.  Also, the product feels heavy duty.  The construction was not taken lightly as the materials seem pretty well thought out."
4352,"works fine, no functional problems here.  No scams or Chinese made reformatted imposters, just regular ol perfectly functional SD cards.  I bought 5 and they all work fine."
4353,"We have several smaller sets of field glasses, but my husband asked for a ""real"" pair of binoculars for Christmas. After much research, I settled on the Nikon 7216, and we couldn't be happier. Clear, crisp focus, comfortable lenses and a wide field of vision--we're looking forward to our next trip to Yellowstone."
4354,"The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives. It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover. The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days. The installed software includes four games; a calendar; a notepad; a contact database; a clock; backlight with timer; an alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create playlists; and rate songs. All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive!However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface. Incorporating the 'Menu', 'Pause/Play', 'Forward' and 'Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well. Accessing these controls is a breeze. Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button. I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space. But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability. It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features. For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini. If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle."
4355,I wear glasses and have a bit of a strabismus (crossed eye) problem. This Nikon Action 7x35 model really fulfills my needs . I find them great for scanning for game or observing birds and wildlife.
4356,"When I bought my Manfrotto tripod a few years ago, I didn't get a bag for it. I was always afraid of it getting knocked around in the trunk of my car. This bag fits perfectly and is well padded."
4357,"Didn't even know this item existed prior to researching purchase.  For security purposes I use two computers, one strictly for financial transactions with no email or Internet (except for financial sites such as bank and on-line broker), but did not want to clutter desk with multiple monitor, keyboard, mouse and speakers.  Using a hot-key I can instantly switch from one PC to the other.  Using two computers in this manner helps secure your access and passwords to financial sites and this small switch makes it much more workable."
4358,What's to say about? I put it in my camera and took pictures and it stored them exactly as it was supposed to.
4359,"My Midnight Dimension Company E 400 Windows 98 SE had the Linksys WMP54GS card in it and it used to work perfectly. (It worked perfectly the first time I installed it!) This computer has a modem and didn't have a wired ethernet card.I have installed and removed lots of networking and VPN software on this machine. Apparently the Windows 98SE Operating System has drivers and modules and registry entries in it that don't let it boot up when this card is in the machine.I got so frustrated I considered moving to Windows XP home (clean install).  Then I considered the cost and the possibility that there might be a problem with the machine that would still preclude correct operation of the WMP54GS.So I bought a new Midnight Desktop with Windows XP Home, and then installed this card.It works flawlessly.  No issues at all.The nightmare of weekend after weekend trying to get this card to work in the Midnight Company E R400 Windows 98 SE finally ended!My conclusion - if the wireless card doesn't work after a day's effort on an old machine and operating system, then give up or buy a current machine with windows XP.  Unless you have nothing else to do with your life and find struggling with technology that doesn't work to be your life's ambition.It appears that older computers and operating system, have unique charateristics that preclude using wireless cards. It might be in the BIOS that recognizes cards, it might be bus speed, it might be the use of PCI connector pins, it might be the operating system, it might be the incompatibility with the cards driver. I don't feel compelled to diagnose what is wrong.Looking back, it appears that the newer wireless lan cards are throughly tested on Windows XP and Windows 2000 computers (the install is usually much easier according to my wealthier friends) and minimally tested on Windows 98 SE and Windows ME computers.By the way, a generic wired LAN card works perfectly in the Midnight Company E R400 Windows 98 SE.Had I known that wired was the way to go, I'd have spent the time wiring the house with CAT5 cable connected to a 4 way router, and have had it working in a weekend.Wireless is easy only with new technology."
4360,Takes ddwrt firmware and high gain antenna's to work as repeater (client bridge) or regular router. I even wrapped it in plastic and put it outside to reach my other building and it worked in pouring rain and -6 temp weather without failing or dropping the signal!
4361,"As a router:I bought this product five years ago to access internet in several devices at home as this one had best reviews among routers in Company A.com. So I won't bother telling you how good it was as a router.As a access point:But last year when I moved to new house, I needed to widen my network signal range for the house. And an access point was also necessary for my internet phone and desktop computer that are located separately from my router (due to strange cable setup in my house) and that require wired connection to AP. So I first thought about selling this old router on ebay or something, and then buying new N router and access point that might cost around $200-300. With little internet research, I found out that I could use WRT54GS as a wireless access point with firmware update. After buying D-Link DIR-655 N router, an hour of updating firmware and setting the access point, there was $100 perfect and new network system for my house. It's been a year since I use it as an access point. I have never had any problem with it.In conclusion, if you are considering wireless G, I strongly recommend this product as a router and access point for its reliability and versatility."
4362,"I do a lot of video editing with Premiere and Final Cut Pro... after I got used to this device, and programed the keys to what I needed. I now do high-end editing (for television and the movie industry) with one hand on my ShuttleXpress, and the other hand on my cup of coffee.It's fairly easy to program, and allows for multiple uses for each button. So, I have an editing mode, a search mode, and a production mode; which gives me fifteen buttons in five... not a bad deal.Plug and play, with a lot of default settings for most applications, a must have for the serious geek  ;-)"
4363,"Harman Kardon came out with the first version of the iSub back in 1999.  The iSub paired nicely with our Apple's Pro Speakers and Cinema Display.In 2000, they came out with a set of matching satellite speakers called Sound Sticks. The Sound Sticks connected via USB making them ""computers only"". They also had no physical volume controls...the sound had to be adjusted via software.After listening to feedback from their customers, Harmon Kardon released an updated version called Sound Sticks II.It is always great to see high end companies design products for the other end of the market.  They bring all of their experience, design capabilities, and quality with them when they move down market.  This brings the level up for everybody... product makers and end users!The Harman Kardon usability folks gave a lot of thought into making the product easy to set up. The designers and engineers clearly had a great time creating this product![...]"
4364,I bought this monocular for my son for camping.  The monocular is of good quality and seems to work well.  It should last well for him for the next couple years of camping.
4365,"For the Company A price of $184.000 delivered to my door, we received about 500 dollars worth of sound. This is almost good enough to compete with my home stereo.We are using a Turtle beach sound card, which offers a variety of eq adjustments. Let's all realize that these are not home stereo sytems, but with the release of these Altec Lansing FX6021's we can see the future, and it looks like the PC is becoming a competitor.Music is so subjective and there is no such thing as a sound system that pleases everybody's ears. For the price you can't go wrong here. Good sound will fill your ears, just be sure you have a good sound card to help these Altecs do their job."
4366,"I see this as a secondary, or bedroom unit for a two speaker ensemble. I am using it with a Bose Acoustimass 2 alongside a TV. I have no need for the tuner or phono input,so I can't remark on those. ( I get my FM from a cable box). The amplifiers are clean and efficient. The box is both rugged and remarkably handsome and upscale. A spare European look that reminds one of the early Bang and Olafson receivers. This is one big heavy box,about 24 pounds. The warranty is two years. Overall, I think it is a great buy for the money after three weeks regular use.One feature not common is the bridged pre amp and amp, allowing addition of an equalizer or other signal processor device. Nice little touch.. The LCD screen has large volume decibel numbers,easy to see. And the remote will let you cut the illumination down (necessary for sure) in two stages. That still leaves a large undimmed blue LED on the power switch, which I have had to block out for late night sleep dimming...First unit was DOA but Company A took rapid and great replacement care of me. This can be considered a Best Buy for its modest price. I have no feeling one way or another for the VMAX pseudo surround effect,but mostly I keep it turned off. No regrets with this buy from Company A."
4367,"I love these headphones - they are circumaural so they fit around the ear for long listening sessions, the plug is a gold plated 1/4"" but they also come with a gold plated 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter. i bought them to replace an old pair of sony's that finally broke, and i'm pretty happy with the sennheiser's - the sound quality is superb - that is they give all the accuracy a person wants without being so true to the music that your tastes will change. one note - these headphones don't have the same warmth as the sony's had.  the reason i'm occasionally annoyed with them is because they are open speakers thereby letting in some outside noises. i listen to tv, jazz, rap, pop, punk, techno, and rock. they all sound as good as i've ever heard them, especially after the break-in period was over."
4368,"Previously owned Sennheiser hd212 pro dj headphones, used it primarily for Steinberg's Cubase & some Reason4.0: $70 back in 2008, still love them but ever since i received my new hd555's i havent had the urge to go back. These headphones are perfect for nearly every source of sound and purpose.  Sick design and delivery of crisps highs-mids."
4369,I got these two years ago and use them for playing on my Xbox and watching movies on my projector. The sound is amazing. I prefer these to my fancy Yamaha home stereo. The velour ear pads are so comfortable.
4370,"I purchased my Sennheiser HD-595 headphones after carefully researching the topic on various headphone web sites and reading various reviews, including the user reviews on Company A. They all seemed to point to one thing: If you want the most comfortable, best sounding headphones, go with Sennheiser. They were right! I couldn't be more pleased with my HD-595 purchase. I use these when practicing piano late at night. I use a MIDI keyboard plugged into a set of multi-gigabyte sampled, software-based grand pianos. With these headphones I'm hearing gorgeous, rich timbres from these pianos that I've never heard before with any headphones or even with my speakers. And they're so comfortable you forget you're even wearing them. I highly recommend them, unconditionally!"
4371,"When watching our favorite TV series/programs, my husband likes the volume in the 20-24 range while I prefer the 10-12 range - plus we have 2 parakeets who increase their volume (it's a flock thing...), to match the TV's!!!  Since receiving/setting up these headphones, my husband wears them and smiles like a Cheshire cat while I watch TV at my volume level or hit the ""mute"" button and read and the birds quietly sleep - we're all happy!!!  I must confess that I sometimes miss a bit of dialog and have 'borrowed' the headphones when they've just been sitting and charging.  Truth to tell, these headphones are awesome and today I ordered a pair for myself after checking to make sure that 2 pr. could use the same charger and TV connection.  Other reviewers have praised this arrangement so we're going to give it a try.  We haven't had any ""hissing"" that others have mentioned but I did notice that turning the headphones into upside-down/sideways positions produced a static-like noise - we chalked that up to Lesson #1 in the ""Don't Do"" column..."
4372,Still working flawlessly some years after purchase. Comfortable and great sound quality. At least a 50 foot range. Sennheiser has always been a great name in audio.
4373,I have this headphones for over a year now and they are great to listen to TV at night. great sound and the wireless has a good range for a bedroom or living room.
4374,"I needed something to allow me to watch TV and not disturb my wife, as our schedules do not always coincide. This product works GREAT and I have been using it for over a year with no complaints. Highly recommend."
4375,"I bought these so I can watch and HEAR tv late night without disturbing my wife.The sound is amazing, with deep bass and crystal clear sound. As for reception I can go downstairs and still get a clear signal even trough concrete walls.They fit very comfortably, but rather loose, which is great to watch tv, but if you plan to use them and walk around you'll have to be carefull not to drop them."
4376,"Once again, I got an amazing deal on this unit right here on Company A. I got it for my girlfriend who had practically given up on any FM transmitter for her her iPod because none of them worked. She tried them all; Belkin, Griffin, and iRiver. When I bought this unit back in early 2006, it was the bulkiest transmitter available and I guess DLO priced it based on it's design rather than it's functionality. Since it's release, the price has tripled. However, if I had to buy it today, I would because I'd rather pay more for something that is going to work than to buy 3 others, although considerably cheaper, that don't. It also charges your iPod too. This unit is a solid proven performer and I highly recommend it."
4377,"I bought it for my Midnight Company I 1700 and am glad with my purchase especially because of the all black leather complements the all black colored Midnight Company I :). Its quite spacious too so you can keep several other travel accessories like mouse and stationaries. I went for this one as i was quite satisfied with my purchase of 15"" backpack from targus which i use for my work laptop and have been using it for almost an year now."
4378,"The S410 is built like a little tank and feels much more robust than the Nikon digital I have owned. I have yet to drop it, but it seems like it can withstand impact. The camera reminds me of my old 35mm in that it is basically point and shoot, unlike my Nikon that required scene selections via a scroll wheel selector to get a decent shot. The fast shot option allows you to quickly take second and third shots when needed. The 3x zoom is pretty standard, but does feel quite limiting. Other cameras offfer trade-offs between options and zoom. It may make sense to consider this before making a purchase decision. While the memory card is pathetically low capacity, all of the manufacturers do this; I guess to reduce cost? The camera's sound effects are selectable and add some value."
4379,"This is a very good general purpose camera for those who do not have photography as a hobby.  All of the automatic features can be manually overridden when the camera out clevers itself.One word of warning.  Many store sell after market accessory lenses that will not work on this camera.  Some mechanically interfere with the zoom, others only slightly change the angle of coverage.Digital Optics brand have both problems.  Kodak brand work properly.  The Raynox brand 0.3X also works.People who are enthusiastic amateur photographers with film cameras and are seriously into it to have several extra lenses will be disappointed with the current state of the art in number of pixels.  Those people should wait for 100 megapixel models to become standard."
4380,"Quality product and received on time.  Good quality cables.  I like the fact that the entire connector covers are colored, making it easier to differentiate them while behind the television in a darkened area."
4381,"If you are looking for a bag just to hold one Mini-DV camcorder or one digital camera; this bag is too big.  Buy something else.But if you are planning to carry all your shooting cameras and their accessories, this may suit you well.I use it to carry ALL of the following and it still has space:1.  Sony Mini-DV camcorder DCRHC422.  Sony DSCP200 digital camera3.  Wide-angle lens for camcorder4.  2 sets of extra batteries each for both cameras5.  Chargers and their wires6.  mini tripod7.  Head cleaning cassette for camcorder8.  Two extra mini-dv cassettes for camcorder"
4382,"I purchased this bag in may of 2010 and it is a great investment. I had just gotten a laptop, and needed something to store it in and lug it around in. This bag is both pratical and a great buy. It has a padded back to it to protect your laptop as well as an inner divided section with padding for your laptop. It also has a nother zippered section excellent for storing books for files and it comes with a divider also ( that you cannot take out). Apart from that, it has a nother section for storing your battery and pens as well as business cards or whatever you want. Mesh pockets align the laptop compartment so you can store your extra perhipals or whatever. Only con that I have is, as a college student, I dont really like carrying it around all the time by the hadel, there is a stap you can wear but I think it looks silly, other then that this bag is great and has been a terrific buy for me and I'm sure it'll be great for you too."
4383,"I use it every day to carry around my laptop,clothes and books and it's very convenient.The zippers are high quality and they won't break down quickly.There are plenty of pockets designed for:*Pens*Water bottle*Cell phone pocket(which can be used for other small items,like keys)*Pocket calculators and other small electronic devices(cell phone pocket is inside this one).*Separate pocket for paper notebooks,if you want to keep separately(the one in middle,see the pic).*Slim pocket for separate sheets of paper,if you want to keep them separately(this is inside the large pocket).*Large area for books.*Laptop area (inside the large pocket).*Sandwich pocket (lol)It's worth the money."
4384,"Great product, Nikon has wonderful glass for this price range, makes total sense since they use so much of it for all of their other optics. I also use a Nikon scope on my rifle and I have been happy with that too. If you plan on any field usage in the rain or in the winter get the sealed binoculars, nothing sucks more than a set of fogged glass lenses!"
4385,As usual Kingston provides their well known quality and reliability in their Memory products. I always trust Kingston for their memory and lifetime warranty. ValueRam also has a great price.
4386,"I was looking for RCA's e-clipz - I really love them, but I just can't find them anymore. So I bought these, and I got surprised: they are even more comfortable (I use them in the office, not jogging, biking, etc.), and they also sound great, compared to other headphones in this low price range. I might use a little extra bass, but overall I'm satisfied.Note: I paid less than $10 for it. Don't buy it for more than $30..."
4387,"This Flash Drive is the deluxe version of many other flash drives I have by different manufacturers. This one is elegant in design, very small (I was surprised by how small it is), and having the flip open end is great since there is no cap to lose. It is also very fast even on a USB 1.0 port. Highly recommended."
4388,"I've been using a Nikon F4 for over 12 years and had no intention of going digital until a friend loaned me his Canon 10D- what a great camera.  Shortly thereafter Nikon released the D70 enabling me to acquire a reasonably affordable digital body and to keep using all my great Nikkor glass.  Although the D70 feels like a toy compared to the F4 it takes fantastic pictures - as good or better than my best taken with Velvia at least up to 8x10 (printed using an Epson SP2200/Epson Premium Luster Paper).  The D70's easy to use and has all the feature's you'd want. I usually shoot on manual, but the D70's ""autopilot"" programs are great & shooting at ISO 1600 gives nice results.  ""Optimizing"" with PhotoShop has been infrequent.  The only problem I've encountered so far is that the CR2's (not cheap) go very quickly - but the rechargeable batteries last ""forever"".  The D70's a no-brainer.***********Almost one year & about 15,000 shots later the only thing I miss about my F4 is not being able to shoot quickly, not being able to take full advantage of my 17-35 mm zoom and not getting enough arm exercise (so I still use the F4 for these purposes).  The D70's fantastic!!"
4389,"Two disc cases are very handy. You can insert printed matter on the clear plastic sleeve. This is great for recorded video that could not fit on one disc (TV shows, sports, mini-series). Push button on inside holds discs securely in place."
4390,"If you need a DVD and have a few older VCRs around, you can not go wrong with the Sony SLV-D350p DVD-VCR combo.  You can attach a RGB or optible cord to see Blu-Ray quality from your DVDs and still have your good old VHS to see your already transferred home movies or movies you still love.. I like the idea that I could buy older VCR movies to add to my collection for hardly any cost.  Also, if you need any support, you can reach Sony very easy, A little more money compared to cheaper models, but worth it."
4391,"Although costing more than a standard modem this unit works as advertised. It offers a 2 way firewall watching both inbound and outbound packets. Most router firewalls are inbound only thus some setup is required for products like steam that need special outbound ports opened. A simple Google search for this modem and steam ports showed me how to fix the problem. The wireless is good not the best but has the latest encryption formats and I get signal thru the house. I have no connection issues to my laptop or playstation 3 using WPA encryption.  I have been using this modem combo for about 2 months with no issues except the firewall ports.  I do not see closed non standard ports as a problem as I appreciate the better firewall, verses my old router firewall/wireless that only blocked inbound ports. If you have cable buy this modem over renting."
4392,I purchased two of them for my car remote (Nissan Maxima year 2000) which I had not changed for 12 years. One of the remote was not working and other was good. I replaced both and the remote performs beautifully.  Great seller and a unbeatable deal.
4393,I am very satisfied with this product. I can now organize my dvd movies. They are now portable and easily accessible.
4394,"Awesome in-ear headphones. They are very comfortable and can be worn for hours. Sound is excellent and the best part is that blocks completely noises from the outside, like kids crying in planes etc. Get sometimes annoyed by rubbing the cables on clothes etc, but that is the only issue I've found with them after several years of use.One thing that helped in comfort is using Westone plugs instead of Sure's, for some reason they fit much better."
4395,"The problem with iPods is they make you fall so in love with them, you keep buying accessories to spoil them with (cases, docks, headphones, speakers, etc).I've had these for 2 years, use them with my dock to connect my iPod to stereos for a bigger sound. I'm not really into tech jargon, so I'm not going to go into things like ""conductivity"", ""electromagnetism"" and the like. All I'll say is, the sound is really crisp and clear, as good (in my opinion, I'll bet audiophiles will beg to differ) as listening to a CD, and that's good enough for me.They look pretty cool too, the snow white cables looking very Apple-like. Take these along with your iPod, and you'll become resident DJ anywhere."
4396,"I bought this cable to connect my Catleap (2560 x 1400) monitor to my 7970. The cable worked as expected, so far no issues with it. The length is pretty great and the material is the one usually seen in most cables."
4397,no further required 17 more words required? that's just stupid and unrealistic. demanding what isn't needed is rude and stupid
4398,"these brackets are good. I thought they would be made from a different material as they look a bit different in the picture than they do in real life (picture looks more like brass or something) but, these brackets holes line up perfectly with my case whereas other brackets I've used would have up to a 2mm displacement from the slots in the 5.25"" expansion bay."
4399,"Durability and weather resistance yet to be determined, but they look good, sound good, and install easily, all for a fair price.  Good Yamaha product."
4400,Cable length is right for what I needed it for. Connected AppleTV to a Vizio soundbar and quality is fine. No problems here.
4401,"I have a ridiculously expensive hi-fi stereo system, running an $80,000 set of Focal Utopia speakers and a set of $55,000 Musical Fidelity KW1000 hand made 1000 watt monoblock amplifiers with a matching vacuum tube preamplifier.  I spent $10,000 on my Nordost Valhalla speaker cables, which actually retail for $18,000, and my Nordost Moonglow optical cables retail for $2500 per meter.The reason I dropped this bit of info into my review is due to the fact that I picked up this $30 Belkin cable for $10 a short while ago, and I'm honestly blown away by how good it really is.  I use it as a link between the optical out on my Samsung LED tv to my Astro gaming A40 BXR 7.1 surround preamplifier and headset, which I use exclusively for gaming and watching films when my wife is sleeping and I actually want a surround sound experience - I can't stand music in surround, I prefer a perfect stereo soundstage.For gaming with the A40, I borrowed a couple of $150-$300 monster cable optical cables as well as a couple of the shop's hand built glass fiber cablees, which run in the $500 per meter range.  The Belkin cable actually sounded *better* than the monster products, which I gave the benefit of a 48 hour break-in period, the same I gave the Belkin.  The glass optic cable sounded much warmer, but didn't have quite the same amount of channel separation...it'd be much better for music, but it's not for gaming with headphones.  I even swapped one of my Moonglow cables in, only to see just how much better they are for the price.  I found that the Belkin actually stood up much better than I ever expected it would.  It obviously couldn't match the sound quality or channel separation of the Nordost cable, but it honestly sounded excellent, with very crisp highs, warm mids and excellent bass response, down to 10hz.  I'm going to be ordering about a dozen of these cables and swapping them in on my game systems and computers, where I had been using $200 Kimber Kable optical with...the Belkin cable sounds identical to the Kimber in some applications and actually embarasses the $200 cable in some cases.  Don't hesitate to buy these cables, I had purchased a 30 foot Pure AV USB 2.0 cable a few months previously that I was very happy with and quite honestly surprised by how high the quality was, as I've always associated the Belkin name with circuit city garbage - I was wrong.  Skip the monster cable, you pay only for the name and fancy metal terminations, which don't aid sound quality, scratch up the back of your equipment, and don't lock in with a healthy click like the Belkin cable does.  The terminations on the Belkin are plastic with a soft coating and a rubber insert where your thumb and forefinger grasp it to insert or remove the cable from a toslink jack.The only point I feel obligated to make is that the Belkin cable absolutely *requires* a break-in period. Mine sounded sharp and brittle out of the package, but warmed up beautifully after leaving it hooked up and just letting whatever I happened to be watching on my tv for a couple of days. I tested it after 24 hours and it had improved a fair bit, but after 48 hours the sound settled into what I described above, and it hasn't degraded or changed a bit since I've been using it, which actually happens to be daily.Don't hesitate to purchase this cable or anything else from the Pure AV line, everything I've tried sounds like a cable that costs ten to twenty times as much!"
4402,works great makes my BIC America V-1220 12-Inch 430-Watt Down-Firing Powered Subwoofer sound awsomecable is good build quality.IF you have a high powered sub buy this cable to hear true bass from your subwoofer.
4403,"Some 5.1 system sod not have optical ports, these are great for sending a 5.1 to your home audio system, use one in my camper and in our upstairs spare bedroom."
4404,"I bought this item to extend my sub-woofer. Good thick wire. Strong RCA end. Gold Plated. This will last, and all of BELKIN products are well made.  SW"
4405,No problems here. A great price for a hard to find battery for my old film cameras. This price blows away the price in my local drugstore.  Battery works just fine.
4406,The cable was exactly as advertised and met my needs exactly.Installed easliy and was a simple task to route through my computer.
4407,I used one to connected a 1TB storage drive and the other for a Blu-ray burner. Works like a champ!
4408,It perfectly worked with my Asus 24x DVD-ROM Drive. It is good price and there is no reason not to give 5 stars.
4409,"Great lens, I am a novice user and am enjoy learning with this product.  It seems no matter how much i mess up learning to use a Nikon D200, the lens never fails, it is tough sturdy lens."
4410,"My hubby and I got these as a Christmas present and I have to say they have been a nice gift.We hadn't had a chance to really test them until recently, and we were both impressed with their performance.  We haven't tested the range out in the flat, wide open, but we were able to get a range of about 2 miles in the moderate hills, trees, and buildings in town.The NOAA Weather option is pretty nice, especially when you want to get a quick, area-specific forecast.  The weather alert feature would also come in handy to let you know when bad weather is coming your way.The reason we chose these specific radios was because of the good reviews from others here at Company A, and I'm happy to say that they steered us in the right direction.  There are other features that might have been nice to have - vibrating alert, or hands-free headphone/speaker set - but these radios contained the most of the features we were looking for.  We're not disappointed."
4411,"About one half of my DVDs are from Russia, and the other half are from the USA. Thanks to Philips DVP642 Progressive-Scan DVD Player this is not a problem. It can be easily re-programmed to accept DVDs from all zones (regions). The trick has been published on the internet. Philips DVP642 plays all video and audio formats. It reads all types of media (i.e. DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW). I have used it with both wide-screen and normal TVs. With a three-cable RGB connection to a wide-screen TV monitor the picture quality is just perfect. The sound quality is perfect in all cases, whether I use analog or digital sound output."
4412,"I have 46 inch Philips LCD. It took me about 1 hr from start to finish. The hardware is very high quality and came with several nuts and mounting hardwares. I love the option to change the angle.. The TV sits about 4 inches from the wall, which is nice. I think you can't really go wrong with this purchase."
4413,"As I was looking at this product listing it occurred to me that with a house full of technology but not one battery powered radio it's not out of the question that we could still be out of touch.  However, unlikely that might actually be, I realized that spending less than $10 for a radio that worked even marginally well could be a bargain.The bonus is that this radio works far better than marginally well!The audio is clear and even pleasant.  It certainly isn't ""HiFi"" and I got a chuckle looking at some of the reviews as I was deciding to buy it that mentioned how the audio only came out the left ear.  (I guess there are plenty of people around who don't remember the world before Stereo-everything.)Adjacent Channel Rejection is much better than I expected.  With inexpensive and poorly designed radios it is common for strong stations to ""spill over"" onto neighboring frequencies and drown out other programming.  (In some extreme cases, only one station can be heard across an entire band.)  The problem is especially noticeable in areas where there are a lot of radio stations.  For example in the Washington, DC areas, which is where I live.  I was delighted to see (actually hear) that as I tuned across both the AM and FM bands individual stations could be heard with no interference from their neighbors.The radio uses two AA batteries and works fine with NiMH rechargeable ones.  However, I would not suggest using them in something that is likely to be sitting in a drawer for a long time.  The best approach would be to put the radio and batteries separately in a water tight container with a few other emergency essentials.  But, I digress...  It will work with rechargeable batteries if you want.A bit of trivia, this radio doesn't have CONELRAD marks.  Sure, that system hasn't been active for 50 years and I still think they should be part of every AM radio dial.With that one ""unfortunate"" exclusion, everything else I need is here is a simple and reliable form.  No cranks or digital anything (except what's inside).  Sure, there's now ""weather band"" and my experience is that its reception is unreliable in less expensive receivers and, like CONELRAD, much of the slack is taken up by the myriad available commercial stations.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  Please let me know if you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it."
4414,This is a great little portable radio and it has good sound and reception. I brought this product mainly to get weather from our local station in case of storms or tornadoes.  It even works in the storm shelter.  We live out in the country on a farm and we need communication when the power goes off.  Would recommend
4415,I got this little guy for when the power goes out and you need a lifeline to the outside world. I just keep it in a drawer with the batteries out until I'll need it!
4416,this products reception is great and volume is great battery life great sony rocks had this in a blackout and was keeping me informed of what was going on outside very helpful
4417,"I just received this lens yesterday and my first impression is that this is an amazing piece of glass.  I debated between this, the Nikon 105 and the Tonika 100.  Based on the reviews, price and the ability for this lens to autofocus with a DX camera, I opted for this one.  So far I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  While I will be using this lens primarily for flower macros, I tried it out as a portrait lens as well.  Very nice.  The lens is tack sharp and compared to the Nikkor 105mm a steal of a price.  The auto focus is not as smooth as my Nikon lenses, but for macro work I will not be using it.  The build feels sturdy and I know I will get a lot of use from this.You can check out my test shots in the gallery[...][...]"
4418,The most little tool that you must have before you go outside taking picture! and it also protected your lens from scratches. Well done Canon!
4419,Typical good Linksys quality.  Easy to incorporate in my wireless network and solved a coverage issue in one bedroom.  I would buy again.  Company A price and delivery as always was excellent.
4420,"Replaced blown OEM speakers in a 1989 Jaguar XJS with these.  They worked well, nice clear sound, fit nicely, low clearance."
4421,there amazing they are great speakers for the price dont expect that much bass but for treble there great not alot of distortion they sound really good cant beat em for 18$ but i wouldnt hook them up to an amp i doubt that theyll do anything but blow but off of a stock head deck or even an after market deck there great
4422,"These were perfect replacements for my Protege5 front door speakers.  They sound great because now I can hear more mids and highs.  Bass is even better.  I was able to keep the stock rainguards intact also.  Highly recommend these since the price is so good.  I got the rear 6.5"" Pyles for my rear doors as well!!!  For this price and quality, you can't lose,"
4423,"Logitech's Desktop Microphone is an efficient and inexpensive microphone that is easy to use.  It simply plugs into the back of your desktop with a pink male plug.  Go into your ""control panel"" and set the volume sensitivity through SOUND, then RECORDING and then MICROPHONE.  It picks up your voice from as far away as six feet, but the cleanest sound is about one foot from the mic.  Too close and you can get distortion.  This is a great way to record sound clips for home videos, practicing speech recognition programs or just practicing learning a new language.  There is also an attachment for the side of your monitor if you choose to leave your computer tabletop clear.  The mic also rotates and can be adjusted up and down about 10 inches."
4424,i have a sony cybershotdsc p200 camera. it fits perfectly in this camera bag
4425,I needed to plug in my Kill-A-Watt without blocking other outlet and this is a must have for said scenario.
4426,"What can I say.. It's a cord, short and it works. The Mfg nailed it. It showed up in a sealed, silver anti-static package.. It may have a dual core processor chip in it? :) Would purchase again."
4427,"It functions very well in my Hackint0sh (Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion).  That's why I bought it.  It also functions well with Windows 7 using Directory Opus 9 and 10 file manager.  I don't know about Windows 8 because I won't use that thing.  I'm switching to Mac and Linux only.  So, get it..and Enjoy this board."
4428,"I recommend this to anyone who ran out of inputs on their home theater system.  My Onkyo only had three digital audio inputs and, of course, when device #4 came around I needed an inexpensive solution to get it connected.  The CtG 28731 really fit the bill.  I just disconnected the S-Video and Optical Audio feed from three of my devices from the Onkyo and plugged them into the CtG, then ran the CtG output to the Onkyo.  My fourth device just got connected directly to the Onkyo.The remote is really small, but its not like you're changing TV channels with it.  No audio or video degradation has been observed, as I would expect from a CtG product."
4429,"Well made and goes onto my 7D very smoothly, clicking into place just like a lens. No issues at all."
4430,This product worked very well for protecting a child's pastel drawing before framing. I have used it in the past on pencil sketches and charcoals as well. Great stuff!
4431,"We had tried several windshield mounts for our car camera, and they all wound up on the dash board because the suction cup didn't hold. This unit has been on the windshield since we purchased, and has held just fine, even in the 90+ temps we have here in New Mexico. Highly recommended"
4432,"Targus TCG200 17 CityGear Miami Messenger Notebook CaseIll stick to the facts my E1705 fits PERFECTLY, the laptops dimensions are:--Height: 1.6-inches (41.5 mm)Width: 15.5-inches (394 mm)Depth: 11.3-inches (287 mm)--There is MORE then ample room for anything you may need, I have read reviews about it being to small but unless you are trying to squeeze a desktop in there you will have ample room.It has great padding but obviously keep in my mind that padding adds size and a little bit of weight.Durable exterior material, been traveling a decent amount and walking around with it, so far no signs of wear and tear.I wont mention every single nock and cranny but the highlights for me were a great side zipper that revealed a built in mesh pocket, and the easy access front has a nice padded pocket that can hold at least 5 or 6 DVD/CDs in soft paper cases."
4433,Best laptop case I have ever purchased.  Expandable and great looking.  lots of accessory pockets
4434,"I have heard many FLASH MP3 players.  iRiver' 512MB 795 has the most neutral, clean and open sound of any player FLASH or Hard Drive player I have listened carefully with Sennheiser HD600s or Sony ear buds (read below).The programming is a breeze.  Interface is via USB.The software is the best I have utilized.I also have a ZEN Micro, which is way too muddy sounding (veiled) no matter what EQ I set it on.The single AA battery is great.  I have gone a full month of listening at 2 hours each night and 1/2 hour in my car before needing to change a battery.  I have also used the MAHA re-chargeable (2300ma) AA and those are great!1.  IF you want the best sounding and most robust player, the 795 will do the trick...as long as you don't cheap out on head phones or ear buds.  Sony's new $40 ear buds come with 3 different size ear canal inserts. The audio engineers at SONY have managed to design an ultra-compact set of headphones with impressive sound quality. Fans of clear treble and robust bass will be equally satisfied by the EX70LP. Also, soft silicon ""earplugs"" are definitely the right step towards to a more involving musical experience. When used together with very light weight drivers, the soft silicon enables an EX70LP to be comfortably used for hours on end. The only complaint is the rather odd carrying case that comes together with the headphones.2.  WMA is excellent.  Follow the recording bit data rates in the iRiver manual for the best sound and best total album capacity.3.  I got mine on sale at Circuit City for apx $100. I've seen them here for $129-139.4.  I agree that the supplied ear phones are not comfy. Get the Sony.5.  You can slam this player around, bump it, drop it (onto a carpeted floor) knock it into walls and it will be fine.6.  The armband is tight on my biceps.  I wear it off my neck with its lariat.Buy one and enjoy the music,TC"
4435,Great price and great operation with a heavy-duty cord set; quick shipping and best price made this a no-brainer purchase!!
4436,"I bought this 25-pack to back up my iTunes library.Pro:-Burned roughly 40 songs per minute... wow that's fast (in under 2 hours we burned all 8.65 days worth of our music)-Read-write capable (at speeds up to 12x)-13 discs held 2165 songs, and since this was a 25-pack, we still have 12 left-No problems with writing, no chipped, scratched, cracked or otherwise defective discs-Comes with a holder and a cover that twists and ""locks""-Case could hold what I estimate is another 8 discs or 33 total if you remove the foam spacer and clear CD-shaped protector-Minimal packaging waste to deal with and easy to open, no act of congress to open-Very good price and even better value-""Sharpie"" ink pen writes on surface okCon:-Disc graphics are annoying, no significant clear space/area to write... surface covered with small ""silver squares"" that dot almost the entire surfaceNeutral:-Top is clear #5 plastic (base is black #5 plastic), good for seeing inside, bad for letting in UV light (hence the nuetral)-Scratch resistance is unknown.  We burned our discs and then packed them away.Bottom line: Highly recommended.  Have had no issues, discs appear to perform as expected."
4437,"We have speakers wired throughout the family area of our house, but it was a hassle to use a regular tuner that needed to be turned on and off. We had a Squeezebox and tuner before, and it was cumbersome to hook up the receiver.Now, we have this hooked up to the squeezebox, so whenever there is signal, our speakers are lit up, and whenever there is no signal, the AMP-100 turns off.It's beautiful, works perfectly and has just the right feature set for what we needed."
4438,I set this up to play music in our master bedroom & bathroom through the built in speakers. The sound is very good considering the source and the auto on/off feature is perfect for this application.  Zero complaints!
4439,"When you live in a condo, you have to limit the power of your speaker system.  I got smaller speakers for my stereo and was missing the lower tones.  (Even my Klispch Ipod player was producing much better bass.)  Finally, I found this subwoofer.  It is smaller than most I've seen, and it really reproduces the bass well.  My music sounds great and my movies play great in DD 5.1.  So far, I haven't gotten complaints from the neighbors.  Two of its standard features are also helpful:  you can decide where its cutoff frequency and at what volume it plays.  Using my Klipsch IPOD player as a guide, I was able to set the subwoofer."
4440,"First a great word about Company A - I ordered this sytem and chose free shipping - and got it 2 days later!  The system was much smaller and more tasteful than almost any of the others on the retail shelves - and the sound is unbelievable for a system this size.  It plays my MP3-RW disks with no problem and reads them very quickly.  I haven't made use of the PC-connection capabilities, as the systema and my PC are in different rooms, but it's nice to know the capability is there.  I researched a lot before buying - and you can't get anything better for the money.  I heartily recommend it."
4441,"Arrived right away without any issues, fits perfectly and was easy to install, this is exactly what I needed. Thank you."
4442,"I used to have a glass 3M privacy screen that sat on my monitor that worked fabulously--so I really know what it should do.  This is a completely different style, it is a flat screen that slides onto the monitor screen.  It sits there and you put little sticky tabs on the monitor rim to prevent it from falling out.  As far as privacy, it does about an 80% job, so way better than nothing but not as good as I was used to.  It is kind of expensive but you can't find privacy screens for much less, if at all.  It is really important to get the correct screen size, so measure carefully.  I would recommend it."
4443,"This is the best lock you can buy, provided that it fits your slot. It worked flawlessly on my iBook G4, and I have heard of other people using it in other computers to their content.Unlike the other locking systems, it doesn't rely on those cheap circular locking systems (the kind infamous for being broken into easily and broken off on computers and bikes). Instead, it uses an actual padlock, and a strong one at that. It isn't unnecessarily large, but it is big enough. Make sure your security slot is vertical if it is on a laptop, because otherwise the lock may force the laptop to raise slightly above the table (which is unacceptable).It does NOT work for new Macs that I have tried it on. MacBook, for instance. It doesn't fit properly, and even if you were to force it in bending the plastic, it forces the laptop to raise up because of the horizontal security slot.If you have the right kind of slot, buy this! You can even slip cords through the lock opening and prevent them from being stolen, too, provided that the end of the cord is too big to fit through (which my mouse was, so I was able to secure my mouse as an added bonus)."
4444,What can I say... they do what they are supposed to do. Apparently Verbatim makes one of the best CDRs.
4445,"So far I've done music cd's and short video with no problems. I love photos, too, so these will also come in handy when sharing. At this price, I can afford to use them without hoarding!"
4446,"Perfect for aftermarket single dins going into a later model Firebird!  Looks good, too.  Color match is ideal and the fit is perfect.  Did not take long to install and even has a small compartment (for either a CD jewel case or thin phone )under the head unit - which makes it a better choice than other dash kits."
4447,"First off, I'm a big Tivo fan.  I was an early adopter - I've had a tivo for years.  At first, I only bought it because I thought it looked convenient when I saw one at a friend's house.  Once I got it, however, I realized that TiVo quickly changes the whole way in which you watch TV.  It's by far the most user friendly device I've ever owned.  I mean - it doesn't even have any buttons on it!  There's nothing tricky about it at all... you bring up the menu by pressing the Tivo button - and voila - there's choices of what you would like to do - in plain english.  If you can operate an ATM - you're overqualified for a TiVo - it's that simple.TiVo series one was great enough in itself...  features like 'Season Pass' where you tell it to record all episodes of your favorite shows just make it amazing.  You can (very easily - without ever going to the user manual) tell it to get all new episodes of show x - no reruns...  Or, get all episodes... on all channels.  After you tell it once - you never have to program it again for that show.Series 2 just adds on to the features.  Hook up one of the available ethernet cards to connect it to your home network (or use USB if your conputer is close enough), and presto - you can view your computer pics, and listen to your computer music from your tivo - through your home stero without any other complicated hook up.  There's even available wireless adapters.Once you get TiVo, you realise that watching 'live TV' is not the way to go... record all your favorite shows, and then watch them on your schedule.  You get to cut out commercials, making a 1/2 hour show more like 20 minutes... so you can watch 3 shows an hour.  And when the phone rings at the climax of your favorite show?  Press Pause.  Talk.  Rewind later.And, if you're a fellow geek, you'll find that you can upgrade your TiVo on your own.  If you are comfortable taking apart a computer... then you should probablly buy the smallest TiVo you can get your hands on, and upgrade the hard drive space yourself.  There's plenty of directions on the web, and you'll save a lot of money doing it yourself.I can't say enough about the benefits of TiVo...  if you like TV, at all, you'll Love Tivo."
4448,I read others reviews and selected this switch due to comments on quiet operation sleek look.After 4 weeks the unit works great and looks fine on the desk as well.I would recommend this from Company A.
4449,"I've had this switch two years.Pro's: No noise, no issues, price.Cons: None for a switch in this price range"
4450,"Bought this camera after reading a lot of reviews (pro and am).Mostly for fast shutter and great quality photos. I can live with focusing problems at low light and lcd not twistable. Love the optional settings. My problem is that in dozens of reviews nobody ever mentioned the fact that a small, light camera is much more difficult to hold steady than a larger bulkier camera. This camera is great for sliding into a pocket, and is only slightly smaller than previous Kodak, but is so much more difficult to hold steady (especially with zoom). I am using tripod a lot more now."
4451,"I ordered this cable so I could use my TV as a monitor for the desktop machine I am building. I am happy to say this cable got delivered before it's estimated date, it's pretty long which is a plus for me, it looks nice and it seems to be pretty high quality. I tested the cable with the desktop machine and it works great. 5/5 I recommend this cable."
4452,"I paid $209 for this lense through Cameta camera via the Company A website. For that price this lens is an absolute steal. It even comes with a lens hood and a very sturdy nylon case (I hate getting nickeled and dimed for accessories). It has a constant F2.8 and a effective range of 36-90 mm on a Nikon digital body.  Build quality is very nice (note quite as nice as a Canon L series lens but far better than a lens such as the Nikon 18-200VR) and far better than most if not all lenses in this price range. . The constant and wide aperture allows you to get some pretty decent indoor shots using built in camera flash or a compact flash such as the SB-400. Also, the lens is very compact at only 3.3 inches long. The only downside is that it is a bit soft wide open and bit slow in autofocusing, but that is to be expected at this price range. A lot of reviews unfarily  bash Sigma lenses and it's not fair to compare them to Nikon lenses costing 5x the price. I own about a half dozen of both brands and it really boils down to a particular lens and not the brand."
4453,"The problem with most DC power supplies is they tend to generate ""Hum"" into your audio equipment, unless they are well-designed.This unit is well-filtered and the output is a clean 13.8 VDC.The lighter port and the DC terminals are very convenient for fast hook-up to just about and 12VDC item you want to run.I purchased 3 units and am very satisfied with the quality of workmanship."
4454,"I build my own indoor speaker systems using car speakers, this combined with an old alpine was my first box.  I have used this box for over 3000 hours and it still sounds great.  It was cheap and still does well.  It doesn't play the highs quite as well as the alpine, but for the price i don't expect it to."
4455,"Only needed one of the pieces for install on Dodge Ram. Fit is good, install was easy and looks good."
4456,"Simple plug and play, works on the 2009 Rav 4.  Just make sure you have any &#34;extra's&#34; you may need for the install as well--electrical tape, butt connectors, cable ties, solder, a friend to install it for you."
4457,"When you connect like color wires use a stripper to strip the pre-cut insulation; but use silver solder and a soldering iron after tinning the tip of the soldering iron. This will prevent the condensation caused by the thermal cycle of night and day your vehicle is exposed to daily outside; otherwise the life of the connection is 3 years as rust corodes the oxygen free copper wire which will then travel up into the inside of the insulated copper wire itself. The silver/solder prevents the loss of electrons and extends the life of your stereo, your connection, and signal response. You will delay attenuation or faded signal from corrosion and get 5+ more years of life. There are two wire harnesses in this kit. Your main wire harness (PIG TAIL) has front speakers,ignition switched power,Memory-clock power,ground...etc. Match as many to you head unit as are available. Your second wire harness (PIG TAIL)has your rear speakers ONLY! If you have 4 speakers and four channels on your head unit then use this harness for easy later removal or make a straight connection and use heat shrink wire wrap around the connection; but remember to put on the wire wrap before you connect and solder! The straight connection will have to be cut later to remove the head unit if your factory set up didn't come with a male PIG TAIL or wire harness to plug into the Metra secondary female PIG TAIL.Hope this helps!"
4458,"These adapters fit my '97 neon, I did not have to cut the factory speaker plug in the door panel, made the job a lot easier, cleaner and faster.  I recommend them no need to solder or cut any wires just plug them into the speaker and then screw the speaker into the door."
4459,"When getting out a radio installed by Ford, after the first ten or fifteen minutes of deciding a hangar will work and realizing that it actually does not work, these little monsters can be a real life saver. The only other option is to use a hammer and a screwdriver.  Destroy the head unit completely and remove it in pieces.These tools are a little easier, however."
4460,"i got a commuter car and this helped my radio from my truck to my other car with no problems. oh, this is in a 99 honda civic ex"
4461,"Seriously, if you need a harness, just get it!For anyone who DOESN'T know what this does: your car has a wiring harness that plugs into the back of your factory stereo. The colors of the cables are often different from the color schemes of most 3rd party stereos, and it is meant to be rather short. Rather than cutting off the existing harness head and attempting to figure out which wires to splice into which with your hands buriend inside your dashboard, you take this nifty little guy to a work bench with your new stereo, splice the wires together, and then plug it into the vehicle! Easy as pie..."
4462,"Yep, it does what it says it does, not really too much more that you can say about this product."
4463,"Bought this for my 2002 Nissan Sentra, and the match is perfect. The texture looks just like the rest of the trim and the color also matches everything perfectly. Highly recommended."
4464,"This thing worked PERFECTLY in our '97 328 BMW.  Every wire color matched the wire colors coming from the plug on our new JVC head unit.  If we had used a different head unit and the wire colors had not matched, it would not have been a problem because the wire color legend is on the Metra packaging and it is 100% correct for the BMW e36.We just color matched all the wires, soldered and shrink-tubed them to the wires from the new radio plug, plugged the Metra plug to the BMW wiring harness, plugged in the radio, and it worked perfectly. It even powers the factory HK amplifier in the trunk and dims the radio display properly when you turn on the headlights."
4465,The wireless keyboard and mouse were purchased as a set (one box) on 12/27/07. They arrived very quickly and I installed them with haste. They were easy to install. I am enjoying the shape of the keyboard easy to use - for a 63 year old who never had typing - the extra buttons on the side and top of the keyboard really make this a step up from my old keyboard - and the mouse with its side to side motion also make its use really nice.I visited my son two days ago and low and behold he has the same setup on his computer - for more than a year. I like the keyboard wrist rest and the angled shape. The price was right and reasonable. Wish I had more computers to purchase more keyboards for. Wireless is the way to go - no more junky wires all over.
4466,"Microsoft has entered the ""color market"" with this sleek, comfortable wireless mouse designed for notebooks. It is slightly larger than some designed for laptops, although it's still smaller than a traditional mouse. My small hands fit perfectly around this mouse without fatigue. Even better, unlike theLogitech MX 1100 Cordless Laser Mouse (910-000718), the design is symmetrical, so a lefty like me can use it with comfort. Because the mouse is fast and sensitive, users who prefer a slower response will have to change their settings. The transmitter is strong enough to pick up mouse navigation if you sit several feet back from your computer. I haven't tested the full range because the farthest I can get from my computer is about four feet. The biggest drawback is the loose-fitting USB connection; although it does not interrupt usage, I'm concerned that the transmitter could snap off or damage the USB port.For Mac users: this mouse has features that are unavailable to Apple one-click mouses. You can get a list of options by right-clicking, depending on what you're doing (word processing, web browsing, etc.). The wheel in the center scrolls, albeit not as smoothly as it should, and, if you depress the scroll button, you get Dashboard on your screen.Customers with large hands might find this mouse suitable only for occasional use since it is designed for portability.For Mac users:  this mouse has features that are unavailable to Apple one-click mouses.

4467,"This is my second Microsoft mouse, I had the one in the picture before. That one stopped working, I think my kid dropped it too many times. I purchased the new one now and found out it has more features. Also, the same mouse was about $5 more at Target and Walmart. I also have a similar Microsoft one for my desktop and am happy with that one too."
4468,We have had no problems with this device. The setup was very easy. We have it always on and use it a lot. So far the first battery is still going strong. Seems to be much better than previous Targus and Microsoft wireless mice that we have had.
4469,Great price. Shipped quick. Works as advertised. Not much more can be said about this product. I needed it for an old PC that doesn't have an HDMI-out.
4470,"What can I say, Cobra has always been a good quality product. The 148GTL is great on sideband as well...."
4471,"I haven't had much time to mess with it yet but it seems to work great right out of the packaging. I'd highly recommend this product. I got it mainly so I could use it with my PS3 and it seems to work great! It had a nice snug fit when I plugged my controller USB cable into it, so you don't have to worry about the two USB cables coming apart, and my controller immediately started charging. I was also able to navigate the XMB on my PS3 just fine. I still have to test it with my Logitech racing wheel, which is the main reason I got it. I've uploaded some more relevent product pictures for everyone because the first one is way off."
4472,This is a nice fitting harness. Easy to adjust and does a good job spreading out the weight of the Bari sax.  The clip is sturdy.  Fit is s bit on the small side so you might want to order larger if you are a big person
4473,"The bag is well made for the price.  Although the fit is loose for my Vanguard MG3 tripod from Costco, the bag looks good when I wear it over the shoulder.The cross section is 4.5"" X 5"", and it is smallest I could find in the net.  And the Cameta camera shipped the bag in timely manner."
4474,Not much to say about a step up ring - it's pretty simple and it either works or it doesn't!
4475,"I bought two female xlr to female 1/4"" adapter and one Male XLR to 1/4"" female converter to use with my Helicon Voice Create unit which only has XLR inputs and outputs. As my mic's have 1/4"" male connectors, and I had extra 1/4"" cables, these adapters were way cheaper than buying xlr cables to connect to my digital recorder.These work great, have a solid feel, and I have not noted any static. Excellent product at a great price."
4476,"First off, this brand of time is the best out there, and I'm sure everyone agrees.This stuff is tough, forms a bond like concrete, and actually made my temps go down compared to other compounds.Second, the price I paid here was almost half the price that Newegg is offering this for. 8 bucks here compared to their 13.I just checked today, the 2nd of February, and it's only 4 dollars! That's a third of the price that they're selling it for!Seriously, if you putting a new heat-sink on you CPU, get this, and get it here. You can't go wrong."
4477,"The Finepix F40fd was a better camera in that size since it offered a larger sensor with fewer pixels, but this one worked well for many many years. It was finally replaced by the SONY DSC-HX50V."
4478,I have no problem with you.  The product is excellent - the price is right - What the hell!
4479,These DVD's are really good... I have yet to have any problems...
4480,This is very good tripod for the price. My only issue is that it is limited in the tilting upwards of the head.
4481,"All in all this is a great 3.5"" to 5.25"" bay converter. It has a subtle brushed anodized black aluminum front that goes perfectly with Lian Li and other brand cases. However, the 3.5"" opening is slightly too large such that it leaves gaps all around your 3.5"" device that are somewhat noticeable- SEE PHOTO ABOVE. For a more pronounced ""brushed"" aluminum effect check out the:SilverStone Aluminum Front Panel 5.25-Inch to 3.5-Inch Bay Converter FP55B (Black). The Lian Li is Company J made, and it definitely looks better than plastic 3.5"" to 5.25"" converters. It is also a more sound and secure mounting device."
4482,I ordered one Cyber Accoustics CA-3550WB Sliver 2.0 Speaker System for my Computer  and sound was very exlent for all music especially music that required hevy bass notes and high notes with no destrostion. I tried my boom box on it and sound was good. I ordered a second one and pluged my boom box in to the earohone plug and had good sounding sound. No more tin-box sound from the 4&#34; speakers. Boy what a difference.
4483,It flat works with no complaints. I use this with a Mac Pro dual core dual processor machine with no glitches ever. it just sits there and does it's job.
4484,There is not much to say other than it does what you expect and it does it very well.  The set-up is a breeze.  You can stream music from itunes on any computer on the network and use it as a printer hub and WAP.  I am very happy with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone who wants to send music from a computer to a home theater or stereo.
4485,"Most folks like me will rely (whether knowingly or not) on their SLRs own internal color temperature sensors. We tend to leave SLRs on Auto White Balance and fire away. This probably will get you 80-90% accuracy in your average shooting situations. But shooting in low light or odd light situations will absolutely play hell with your rig and you will have a real hard time getting anything to look right.Yes we can all play the Adobe Lightroom Shuffle and spend time color correcting the white balance.... OR .... you buy an ExpoDisc and never bother second guessing anything again.  This is a very well designed and well manufactured professional accessory.  I shoot Canon, who has a reputation for recreating skin tones better than anyone, and I find that this piece improves on that even more.I find it great to use on overcast days and virtually ANY indoor lighting situations.  Even does a great job to correct for flash use.  Just make sure you read your manual carefully and understand how to properly set a custom white balance on your SLR.Highly Recommended"
4486,"Since digital links either work or they don't I bought the least expensive 50 foot cable I could get to run my HD PVR to the back bedroom for viewing.Note: my cable came with gold plated ends even though the pictures show just plain metal ends.  I don't know if that is standard but the quality of the cable in person was higher than the picture show.I was very impressed about how easily the cable uncoiled and did not fight me going through the attic.  Alot of coiled cables shipped tend to hold their coil shape for years it seems, but this one layed flat from day one making installation easier.All taken it works with no problems, no dropouts, no pixelation, and HDCP runs fine over it.  I can't complain in any way so 5 stars."
4487,"I bought this as ""Used"", but like new condition, the product is amazing, easy to configure, a lot of functions to play around, very nice user interface, I integrated into my website, looks great. First I used wired mode to configure it, then switch to wireless mode, it worked instantly. The product was registered with [...] by previous owner, I was not able to change the registration since I don't have the password, then I simply disabled viewnetcam.com and used dyndns.org free dynDNS service, not the big deal. I am very pleased with this purchase, and glad to have such great quality camera."
4488,"Decided to get this as my TV only has an optical output, and my receiver only has 2 optical in's and they were used up.  Still had 2 coax. available.  I've only had this a couple weeks, but so far it is working flawlessly - great little device.  Con is it uses a power brick - but I guess there's no getting around that...  I'm sure it draws next to nothing for power anyway."
4489,The quality of the cables are superb  and I found no defects whatsoever. I recommend these to anyone looking for long rca audio cables. Great price and great quality.
4490,"I am extremely happy with this product. It sounds as good as any that I have heard, especially in my system where it connects a component to a outboard DAC. It iw well constructed, and for a short run audio coax cable, it is perfect. I know that cables can be extremely expensive (I really question the true worth of some of the outrageously expensive cables), but this cable certainly is not expensive and it does the job for me perfectly. I would highly recommend it to anyone to try. If for some strange reason you do not like it, you have not lost much."
4491,"its small, convenient, and it works! Keep in mind its only an adapter, not a converter"
4492,"Fits my lens and filter perfectly. Made if metal, perfect for tossing in my camera bag, and ready when I need it"
4493,"Before I retired 13 years ago, the group I supervised used hundreds of PowerSonic batteries.  They are a good, reliable battery that will outlast most other batteries I've tried.  This battery was a replacement for a Chinese battery that I'd purchased locally about a year ago.  (For more money than I paid for the PowerSonic.)A few reviewers complained of the size of the connectors.  Attention needs to be paid to the size of connector you need.  If your connector is the small size (.187 inch wide) you need the PS-1250F1 battery.  If your connector is the larger size (.250 inch wide) you need the PS-1250F2 battery.  They were the same price at the time I ordered mine."
4494,This item was a great asset to my Goldwing motorcycle. works wonderfully on trips to keep me eyes open. wow
4495,The best charger I ever had but the Duracell pre-charged batteries are better than the Sony's that come along.
4496,I've had an impressive 100% burn rate with these.  My third spindle is almost gone and I'm writing a review before I reorder.
4497,"This is the best charger, it charges very quickly. I was so impressed that I ended up buying 2 more to gift my sisters. It charges very quickly and is dual-voltage, so you can carry and use it anywhere without any problem. I have this charger for past 2-3 years and I have not had any problem."
4498,I used this as an extension to connect my Behringer mixer to a stereo receiver and audio quality is just fine. I have ordered a handful of cables from cables to go and they ship quickly and quality is good enough for 99% of applications. I use them a lot on my home equipment.
4499,I bought several of these to hook up extra monitors to laptops and also use one on the TV.  It's really handy to have several around the house.
4500,"Keeps me from kinking toslink cables.  No apparent signal degradation.  Does it's job well, which was to allow me push the cable box flush to the wall (along with various other right angle adapters)."
4501,"Works well, have been using it for two-three months, no issues.  I would recommend it as it is a simple device."
4502,"I really liked these cable zip ties and I love the way they cleaned up my computer, in fact I cleaned up about 2 of my friends computers and i still got like 85+ zip ties. They really are too much for a one time job but I love that i'm set every manufacture moves over to free Velcro ties inside of PSUs and Cases.Great stuff and the length was plenty for the average computer cable bunch. JUST the right size for a non-modular PSU; turns an octopus PSU into something much more manageable."
4503,"If you need a 3 meter Toslink to optical mini-plug cable, go ahead and buy this one.  You won't regret it."
4504,"I've purchased several of these regulated, linear power supplies to replace the cheap ""wall warts"" that come with most of my audio gear.  At around $16 for a regulated power supply with decent transformer, it's a great deal!  Much better than the cheapo ""switching"" power supplies that come with most equipment these days.So far, all of the ones I've bought are still working.  Hope Company A keeps carrying this little PS at a reasonable price for a long, long time."
4505,"After spending 4 weeks investigating wireless home theater system. I realized that they are not really wireless. So finally I came across this Bose 321 GS II System. I went to my local electronic store to listen to the sound and I was blown away. The price is not cheap but you really get what you pay for. The sound quality is excellent. I can't believe this is only from two speakers and a subwoofer. Now I am even able to listen to my regular TV program in surround sound. The setup process is easy to get you started. Everything you need is included in the box. The universal remote control is great. Now I am only using one for my TV, VCR, and Cable box.  If you want to take full advantage of this BOSE system then you might want to think about buying extra cables which is all described in the setup CD."
4506,"It does what it's supposed to do.  These are genuine Panasonic batteries, so I can only assume the quality is better than a knock-off, and the price difference wasn't enough for me to take the risk."
4507,Did what it was supposed to do. Made in Chima but try finding things that aren't unless yo buy the name brand at 5 times the price.
4508,"I got these speakers, cuz they looked cooler than the LogiTech ones. I just bought, now, some LogiTech 2.1 speakers, and would recommend the logitech over creative speakers for the 2.1 catagory."
4509,"Works great in my car.  I needed to protect the 10 AWG power wire going from my battery to my Alpine 9835 V-Drive head unit, and this fit the bill perfectly.  I just soldered the wire to my 10AWG extension power wire, and I was good to go!"
4510,"How much can you say about this?  I bought it to do a bypass on my car stereo, and then found out there was a much simpler solution, and went with that.  Nothing wrong with the item at all."
4511,Awesome a must buy. This baby delivers awesome bass sounds for movies and music. I would but another with out any doubt.
4512,"This really rounded out my system!  This sub hits HARD for a 10&#34; woofer.  It's in my bedroom with 2 Sony floor speakers (3-ways) and it really kicks up the low end.  There are separate volume and crossover controls on the unit itself which are great for on the fly adjustments.  The bass sounds excellent in movies; explosions rock the room and exhaust notes on race cars sound phenomenal.  For music, once you get the equalizer and crossovers set correctly, it's unbelievable.  I've tested everything from Classical to Dubstep on here, and I've heard sounds I never knew existed.  Crystal clear audio at an amazing price."
4513,"Like many reviewers, I have to say that not only does it clean gently and well, but it really repels the dust. I have 3 large computer monitors in my house and I cleaned only one with endust to test. After 2 weeks, no dust on the monitor cleaned with Endust. The other monitors are dusty. I also cleaned my entire laptop with it and the laptop now looks brand new.  Worth every penny. Too bad it's only available on Company A Prime for $7 and at Target for $5.99. I used a microfiber cloth."
4514,You can really pay a lot for this product but what a waste. Purchased the for very little and could not ask for better.
4515,"I was surprised that this cable has worked without problems.Using with a PC as source, and only for Video, Audio is Optical to a Yamaha AVR. TV is a Samsung 50"" 720P. Have not used any BD discs yet."
4516,"Installing new audio/video equipment in my home, these HDMI cables were just the fit. I had no idea that these cables delivered so much better than the old RCA cables.  This is the way to go."
4517,This is the first HDMI cable I've seen priced at exactly what they should be worth. I paid 23 cents for the cable and $2.95 to ship it. It arrived in less than a week and it works just as its supposed to. The cable doesn't look fancy but it seems plenty sturdy. The ends are gold plated (or gold colored at least) but its doubtful that it even impacts performance at all since HDMI is a digital signal. This cable is well worth the pocket change unless you have more money that you know what to do with.
4518,"Even thought this cable didn't work for my Lenovo, it worked for my boyfriend's computer. It's a great length and provides clear audio and video from your laptop to tv. His laptop was a Midnight, and it works perfectly for him."
4519,"I bought this cable to convert my new Sony DVD player to HD, and it was easy as pie to install.  Now I have great HD quality picture on my Sony upconverter DVD player which I also bought from Company A on sale for $59."
4520,"MY DVD, AND 2X BLURAY PLAYERS USE EVEYDAY"
4521,"Just as others have stated, this cable does everything any other expensive cable does. I still can't believe I paid $1.70 and free shipping because it works PERFECT! I hooked up my Toshiba Satellite to my Philips LCD 32"" and it worked immediately. Nothing to set up, nothing to mess around with."
4522,I ordered this HDMI cable to work with my apple TV! It works excellent and you cant beat it for the price!
4523,"I was so amazed at the price I bought 8, now all my components are HDMI, thanks Company A"
4524,"this is a piece to go along with a bundled present, it will be used to load additional information on to it, I was amazed by the size of it"
4525,I purchased this product and I'm happy to say that it does the job I needed it to do. Good price too.
4526,"These are the cheapest and best HDMI cables that I've used. The price of the cables for the length that you get is unbelievable. The shipping is $2.50, which still makes them many times less than anything available in stores, and very competitively priced for other budget cables online.What's amazing is that HDMI, being a digital signal, either works or it doesn't. This means that these are actually no worse or better than Monster cables or any other cables, so it really doesn't matter which ones you get unless you prefer to spend 100x more for the same thing. It's kind of like those 1800PetMeds commercials. Why pay more for the same thing?I have two of these HDMI cables. One of them is hooked up to my 42"" Vizio in the living room and the other is hooked up to my 36"" Dynex in the bedroom. The quality is astonishing and I'll be buying another cable for my next TV that's going in the office."
4527,"I have to side with the vast majority of reviewers who gave this inexpensive cable a solid thumbs-up!  So far, it's worked perfectly.  I figure if I don't repeatedly disconnect/connect this cable, I won't experience the problems a few reviewers have mentioned...and, if I do, it cost me only $1.88!!!  Go for it!"
4528,"The most difficult thing about using these cables was waiting for the shipment to show up.  I love the fact that I got my stuff hooked up for less than $2.  I ordered a bunch to allow for future connections so I likely won't need to ever order them again.  So there you go; the last cables I will ever need to buy.Stop reading reviews and click ""Add to Cart"" you won't be disappointed."
4529,I was not sure if i should buy this for my PS3 but i decided that it worth the try. Unlike lots of other people i am getting 1080P from my PS3. Go ahead and give this a try.
4530,"It's HDMI and it's digital.  Don't fall for anyone that sells ""higher"" quality digital cable.  I'm an electrical engineer and they are all the same.  I don't see any flicker or disconnection from using the cable, which means, it works!  This guy I bought from Company A shipped so fast, it was unbelievable.  And it's less than 1 dollar.  Don't get ripped off from any other places that sells at a higher price."
4531,CHEAP BUT WORKS!!!! I have had no problems with it works as advertised and sai in the numerous other reviews.
4532,The only brand I will buy as I have said before. All research leads to these being the longest lasting as well as the better for recording clear video onto. Some other brands I have use don't record the quality of the video as well as Verbatim will. WIll oder more has free money allows me
4533,"This is a great product which stores tons of data.  This one box should last me the rest of my life.  Now if I can get my wife to switch from using VCR tapes to the discs, I would be set."
4534,"These were perfect and inexpensive for the intended application; I picked up a few extra, just to have on hand, given their low, low price, yet superior quality!"
4535,I use this with my laptop to show movies on the tv for my mother. don't have to crowd around the laptop to see movies or pictures. know every one will see them during the holidays
4536,"a lot of stereo receivers/tv's have toslink, makes sense to use this attachment over older analog.  no sound loss or degradation.  these are cheap and reliable"
4537,"I'm giving it 5 stars because other stores sell it too, but shipping from ClearAV was bad: I was unable to track the package using the tracking number they sent me, so after 4 days I sent an email about it, got no reply. Still didn't get my cable at deadline, sent another email and received a reply late next day saying the package must have been lost (which still puzzles me). They experdited another shipping and it arrived after 3 days. Everything was all good afterward but still shouldn't have happened to begin with."
4538,"why purchase a $20 cable when you can buy this one. a fiber optic cable is a fiber optic cable, this one works great! I get awesome 5.1 surround from this $2 cable"
4539,"I Use this for my laptops sp/dif output and it works flawlessly. It hold the cable very very well, and also ""locks"" into my laptop, it takes good effort to remove it so it won't ever accidentally come undone.Perfect Product, great price, fast shipping, no complaints."
4540,"The A75 and A85 are Excellent follow-ups of the A70, and offer some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the larger LCD, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, ""C"" dial position to save your custom settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc. The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you want 5 megapixels of resolution, a very useful rotating LCD screen, and Flexi-Zone (lets you choose an area that is off-center to focus on), then look at the A95.Please note:  my review of the A75 is the same as the A85 because they are pretty much the same camera with the 1 megapixel different.  There are some differerences between my review of the A95 and this one."
4541,"Thick, tough, works flawlessly.  For the money, I would definitely by more of these.  I've had no problems.  Works with my flash drive, external hard drive, ipod, etc.  No problems and at full speed."
4542,"I bought this for a program on my computer, and they work great. Sounds good, and people hear me fine."
4543,"Bought a 2003 Corolla S to be my child's first car. Decided the stereo needs to replace right after drove back home. Budget and some level of quality were the goal. First, bought and installed a Dual XDMA-6415 (87 bucks including dash kit and harness here) bluetooth head unit. Stereo immediately turned clear and crisp especially front 6.5"" factory component due to the Dual's CEA-2006 RMS 17Wx4 output. Found rear 6x9 has some room to improve. Bought and installed Orion CO690 (33 bucks at Frys). Test drive many times and confirmed no amp and no aftermarket front components are needed in near future since now the high, middle, and even mid-bass are ok.Now turned to low end bass. We only listen to soft rock and classic music and wanted an easy and inexpensive setup. No strong window shaking bass is needed. Bought this Bazooka (99 bucks factory refurbished here) and installed it to trunk. Use front speakers' signal and head unit's power. The bass is loud and deep, cannot believe its amp is only 50W. Spent 219 bucks for the whole thing and now the car stereo from low to high is quite different from before. For the sound quality and cost I'm satisfied with this Bazooka BTA850FH."
4544,Bought it on recommendation of a co-worker. I am satisfied with the product. Excellent audio quality.
4545,"I purchased these speakers for use on my HDTV and I couldn't be more satisfied. The bass booms and the small speakers really accent the highs. I have DirecTV and these babies sound real nice on the Sirrius and XM music stations. I priced a set of Bose Companion 3's and they would have cost me about $70.00 more at a Sam's Wholesale, so I think I got the better deal. I would recommend these to anyone. I have a smaller set of speakers on my computer because I just don't need these Logitechs on my PC-a little too much for me on the PC, just right for the TV. Once again, kudos to Company A.com. They are the best online source I have ever used. Communication from Company A.com lets you know when your item is going to arrive and the shipping is always quick."
4546,"When you want to see if you are getting spark to lawn mower plug or check for the missing plug in your vehicle, use this little pen size tool to check! works great!"
4547,"Reception has always been a problem where I live, but you would never know it with the Recepter.  It has rich sound, digital tuning, excellent reception on both AM and FM, and small footprint.  The simple controls are a bonus.  There's no seek feature, but as it pulls in so many stations clearly and has 20 presets, seek isn't really needed.  Compared to my 2 Bose Wave radios, which do have the edge in sound, the Recepter gets stations clearly that the Bose can't even lock into, it's much smaller, and less than half the price.  My only gripe is the display is hard to read on days of bright sunlight, when it loses contrast and picks up glare, though it's otherwise easy to see (my Bose and an old Proton can be seen clearly in any light, even in the same spot).  Overall, its sound, size, reception, and simplicity rate 5 stars even if the display is not always perfect."
4548,"I have now used my Rio Carbon on several long distance trips, using it to listen to recorded books.  I have found it to be absolutely great.  It is easy to use, very small and wonderful to handle...all in all a great device.  One of the best purchases I've made lately.  I highly recommend it."
4549,"I love this thing. I tried the MX700 and it was a pig, too big and slow. I'm using the MX1000 w/a Mac G5 and it works great. The tracking is frankly amazing, super sensitive but you don't feel like you are on edge trying to control w/micromovements. I have a small platform for my mouse to sit on so I was wary of this thing being too big, but it works great. In the last 6 months I've been through 5 different mice. This is miles beyond any of the others (including Apple's, Kensington's wireless, MX700, the Bluetake)."
4550,This item is great for hiding cables behind a wall when running accorss a room. My PC is on the opposite side of the room from this adapter. It makes for easy accessibility without making your device noticably slower. And making a wire discrete behind the wall makes the room look nice and neat.
4551,"i got this to upgrade the standard memory on the netgear readynas duo, and it seems to have given it a nice performance boost. this particular module is listed as being officially compatible with the duo by netgear: [...]"
4552,"These headphones got me safely through an online master's program.  They have a good microphone and the headphone speakers worked well too.I did not like the behind the head fit.  I sometimes wear a pony tail, and that caused problems because I had to let my hair down to use these, but then my hair got in my face and made me itchy or on my neck and made me hot.  I prefer an over the head style.  So, think about if you think the over the head or the behind the head fit would work best for you."
4553,"I don't know what I was thinking.  Why did I wait so long to buy one of these? It's cheap, built well, and compared to analog is louder and sounds better.  A great cable at a great price."
4554,Pros:software for fingerprint works flawlessly and VERY robustCons:the fingerprint pad needs to cleaned (towel + water) REGULARLY or it wont sense your fingerprint anymore
4555,These speakers are absolutly great.  I trashed my Klipsch ProMedia 5.1 Ultra's for these instead of repairing them.  So glad I did!Highly recommended.
4556,the drive was new never open work perfect esy to use and easy to handle now i can move all my pics an music at one time
4557,great item arrived as described in great conditionshoots nice and not alot of wear .shutter has no issuesthank you
4558,"I've been using this flash for about 6 months and it is excellent.  It combines beautifully with my 20d.  Photos come out very well exposed.  It can be used as the primary light source or as a fill flash in the program modes on the camera. It's really intuitive, and even though it has many manual adjustments available, even a beginner like me can really find the ""sweet  spot"" for a well exposed shot.In my opinion, the best feature about the flash is the ability to bounce it in a large variety of directions.  Because the flash is so powerfull, you can even bounce it off walls that are 15 - 20 feet away and get really good results.  I use it with an Omnibounce filter which I believe takes the harshness away.  The results can be really close to what you would expect from natural lighting.At one point I tried to see how it would work in continuous shooting mode.  I was able to take 29 flash shots in under 6 seconds.  My camera got hung up before the flash did.It's a great flash to buy if you want to use it as a master with some less expensive secondary flashes.  It provides a reasonably inexpensive avenue to some fairly flexible lighting.My only complaint with the flash is that it is not always recognized by the camera.  I have tried to clean all the contacts  but the problem has not gone away.  Sometimes I need to try ""jiggling"" it before it interfaces with the 20d.  However once it locks in, it stays locked in.  This has not been a major problem for me - you can tell if the camera recognizes the flash by the sound the flash makes.  However, if I were using it professionally I don't think this would be acceptable.  I still gave it 5 stars because I'm not sure whether the problem is the result of the flash or the camera."
4559,I've had the Canon L series lens and they're great.  This lens could easily have been marketed as an L series lens as well.
4560,"The ultra wide zoom has been a mainstay of pros, especially photojournalists, since the early 1990s. Sweeping landscapes, operation in tight quarters and ease of hand holding are hallmarks of this range. The EF-s 10-22 3.5-4.5 USM is the first lens to bring this range to APS-C (1.6X crop) cameras like the 7D, 60D, 70D and Rebel.CONSTRUCTION: My initial impression was it's a little plasticy and zoom and focus rings are slightly coarse and stiff. After a year, it loosened up nicely but is still a notch below the smoothness of my EF-s 15-85 3.5-5.6 IS USM. However, it's light and petite: easy to slip in a coat pocket and ideal for travel or hiking. The metal mount and polycarbonate barrel make it durable yet lightweight. The front element moves slightly during operation so a UV filter is needed to seal the front from dust.AUTO FOCUS: Ring-type USM drives an internal lens group and, thus, AF blazes and is silent to human ears. The front element doesn't rotate during focus and zoom operations. It has FTM, allowing manual focus without switching out of AF mode. This AF design is optimized for stills and not ideal for video: the built-in mics on my 60D and 70D picked up a high pitched stutter from the motor and contrast focus is jerky during video recording. The workaround is to use an external mic and/or focus manually. If video is your main thing, buy theCanon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STMinstead as the STM drive is stepless and silent to the camera mic.OPTICAL PERFORMANCE: Basically, this lens features optical quality of an L series wide zoom in a prosumer barrel. Wide open, this zoom is sharp and contrasty in the middle of the frame with slight softening towards edges. The wide side is the sharpest with slight degradation as you zoom towards 22mm. Sharpness across the frame improves as you stop down. By F8 it is pin sharp from edge to edge. I'm going for increased depth of field for landscapes and cityscapes, so I leave this lens at F8 most of the time. I only shoot wide open for occasional low light snaps.Distortion is well corrected. There is a wee bit of barreling at the wide end and slight pincushion ate the long end. But less distortion than my EF-s 15-85 3.5-5.6 IS USM and a little better than the 17-40 4L USM. Like any wide angle optic, you need to compose carefully to avoid perspective distortion, e.g., noses appearing too large or buildings falling over.Chromatic aberration is a reality with zooms and this one is not exempt, with magenta fringing along high contrast edges. e.g., tree branches against a bright sky. However, it is mild and easy to remove in DPP, LR or Aperture. In normal light you will never notice magenta fringing.Flare is well controlled for a zoom: no problems with sunsets or streetlights. Nevertheless, a lens hood is recommended for protection and to shade the front element from glare. Speaking of hoods...HOOD NOT INCLUDED: The recommended EW-83E hood is bulky and (looks like a dish) and costs $32. Worse of all, it's so shallow it offers little protection. I have an EW-83H that came with an EF 24-105 4L IS USM. The bayonet mount is the same size as the EW-83E but the hood is longer and narrower, offering increased protection. I thought the longer length might vignette but, amazingly, it doesn't vignette at any focal length, has better protection from glare and less bulk than the EW-83E. If you're going to spend money on an expensive hood for the 10-22 3.5-4.5, get the EW-83H instead of the EW-83E. If you're on tight budget, check out the Vello EW-83H clone/knockoff.LAST BLURB: This zoom is a specially lens and a bit wide for casual use. After all, 10mm covers 107 degrees! Nevertheless, I reach for this lens to shoot cityscapes, landscapes or in tight quarters. It has ideal coverage for spacious cathedrals or mammoth train stations. If you need an ultra wide zoom on APS-C, this is among the best in terms of image quality: sharp, fast to focus and easy on the shoulder."
4561,Good quality bag! Fits all my gear! Its quite large though but I guess that's a small price to pay considering the capacity of the bag!
4562,"This is plenty big enough for a body, a few lenses, battery chargers, cables, etc.  It has room to spare.  Well made."
4563,This bag is great! There is enough room for all of my accessories along with the camera and two extra lenses....
4564,"My husband bought this camera about 3 months ago and we continue to love it...wow, what an improvement over our old Canon Digital Elph. The Casio is SO easy to use: I've never even looked at the manual. Admittedly, I still have a soft spot for my (aging) Oly C-2100UZ but of course it is not pocketable like this Casio. This little workhorse gets taken anywhere and everywhere and gets a lot of use!The Casio has a HUGE LCD and it feels very sturdy. It's incredibly responsive and just feels good! I'm happy with the picture quality (quite good for a subcompact) and I didn't realize how much I would like the cradle for recharging the camera. We bought an extra battery, and haven't even needed to use it yet!"
4565,"The battery came just fine, with a protector base to store the battery (in a clean place such as the backpack). I would say that if I wouldnt have got this battery I would have been in trouble more than once since Rebel XTi dryes them fast with its big LCD. However, Im not sure that they would last too long on other cameras since I havent tried it."
4566,These batteries are a bit stronger than the original battery in my ViviCam 3930.  Also less expensive.
4567,"I got this pair for my son who is 13 and helps me in the studio. I paid $20. They sound as good or maybe even better than my  $150 ""big name brand"" pair. Kind of makes me sick man. Sure the construction is cheaper and you don't wanna go yanking on the cord or anything and I doubt they'd survive an accidental step on but what the hell, buy three pair. You can't lose with these. Get 'em"
4568,"Apple designs excellent accessories for it's products. This a/c adaptor does a great job of charging iPods. The only problem is spending $30 for something that realistically should cost about $15. But, then, Company A sellis it for $30 and Best Buy and Target sell it for $40! So, comparitively, this is a bargain!"
4569,"I am so impressed with this set. The fingerprint reader has proved very reliable and makes password storage secure. This is my second Microsoft unit with a wireless mouse and I am pleased to see that they have really improved the battery usage. Batteries in my mouse last 3 times as long as they did with my old unit. My mouse lasts over 6 months with cheap batteries. I am also equally impressed with the hotkeys and the fact that they are completely customizable to open whatever file or program you want. It is true that is does not work with Firefox, but I am fine with that after the release of IE7."
4570,"They shipped me the wrong part (it was the opposite of what is listed) but when I sent them an email they immediately agreed to ship the correct part at their expense and offered to let me keep the incorrect one. After I'd gotten it I realized I already had the correct part, so I told them it was okay and I would just keep this one in case I ever needed it.They would have gotten 3 (or less) stars if they'd had crappy customer service, but my experience was excellent and so even though it was the wrong part (mistakes happen) I'm still more than happy to give them 5 stars."
4571,We use an antenna here in the mountains and the transformer makes it easier to get the signal to all of our sets.
4572,Just plug in Two Relays and all you have to do is connect a few wires.  Saves a whole lotta time for a few bucks.
4573,"After lots of research, I finally chose the ER6is and they're great.  Insertion into the ear canal takes a little practice (for some reason I can easily insert into my left ear and make a good seal every time but my right ear often takes a couple of tries) but after some practice it becomes a snap.  I have smaller ears and found that the smaller inserts (blue) work much better for me.  The noise isolation of these is wonderful and the audio clarity and bass response are excellent.  I'm being VERY careful with these as the cable is pretty thin by not removing them by pulling on the cable and keeping them in the included carry pouch.  I just couldn't make the leap on the ER-4Ps for more than twice the price and so far, I don't think that I'm missing much."
4574,My internal sound system was crackling and hissing even after a new board was installed. If I had known about this external system I would have gotten it and saved some money. The sound is fantastic and I have a much better volume control with the manual settings on the unit itself plus the regular controls on the monitor. It has other features that I don't use so I can't comment on those.
4575,"Some products transfer analogue source, like 8 mm video cassettes, to your computer in a manner that unlocks audio from video.  This can result in the sound being a fraction of a second to several seconds out of sync, like a badly dubbed 60's movie.  This product keeps audio and video locked so the final digital version on your computer looks and sounds just like your original analogue source material.  It works very well in this regard.  It also has phenomenal capture of my years old 8 mm tapes, with very good final picture quality.  It's easy to use and works well with an Intel Mac.I learned of the sync issue with Pinnacle Video Capture for the Mac (unlocks audio from video during capture).  Using a device that unlocks audio from video can result in hours of time correcting the problem with editing software.  The ADVC 110 cost a bit more but paid for itself with the first home video I captured just in the time it has saved me."
4576,Purchased these cards for use in a VMware server and they work perfectly fine.  Included the short and tall brackets and the indicators are reasonably easy to see.
4577,What a great accessory! The clip is nicely done. Everything about it quality and attractive. It attached to my GPSMAP 60cs in seconds and it works with the protective cover in place. I can now attach my 60cs on anything with a loop. Worth every penny and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
4578,"Ion Portable USB turntable/vinyl archiver is everything the Crosley record players should be. This turntable is well made, and does what it is supposed to do. Completely satisfied."
4579,My detector is too heavy to be supportes on visor. I am using glass mounted bracket until I find something better. I need to use a stationary mount.
4580,This worked exactly as expected and made the radar detector install look incredible.  It comes with plenty of cord too.
4581,"I use these on my MacBook Pro and on a Windows laptop, every single disk burned correctly.Highly recommended and good value for the price."
4582,"I read the complaints about this product, and frankly I was worried.  When it arrived, however, I found it to be the best keyboard I have bought.  I should note that I have a T5, not a T3, which people have had trouble with.  Also, I have noticed that when the keyboard is activated on the handheld, I sometimes bet buggy behavior from the Palm, but I have noticed that it only happens in the computer lab where I teach.  The school recently put in all new ""power saving"" flourescent lights that seem to drive the IR port nuts, but that's not Palm's fault.  I blame the annoying, expensive lights!  Everywhere else, the keyboard works flawlessly.  The design is solid, sturdy, and easy to use.  Most impressively, however, there is no lag between keystroke and entry.  I have never had a PDA keyboard that performed so quickly!  I had just learned to accept the fact that I would have to type slowly, and go back every 10 keystrokes or so to fix the missing letter.  Not with this little wonder!  Typing is flawless!  I cannot say enough good about this keyboard.  If you have a T5, don't waste your money on one of the cheaper models.  Go for this one!"
4583,This is a great company and price for the tapes.  The clarity on the tapes is amazing.
4584,"Lens works great!  Focuses quickly in all but the lowest light conditions.  Good, sharp pictures at a great price, waited a long time for a deal like this."
4585,Needed to extend a coax cable for my dad's TV. This connector enabled attaching an extension. Works perfectly and the price was reasonable.
4586,"Great bag, padded sleeve over HP Pavilion TX2510 - fits perfectly. Too big without sleeve. Sleeve is an extra item. Very high quality, functional design."
4587,"This box is sturdy, plastic-covered cardboard that accepts the CD sleeves but probably not the hard cases. Since I only checked the sleeves, I couldn't say&#8230;."
4588,My bunny LOVES these rings. They're the perfect size treat and they are good for her.  There are also a ton of treats that come in the bag which makes the cost more than worth it (at a little over $3).
4589,"This arrived in 2 days in perfect condition, well-packed. It works perfectly, and replaces the original cable which no longer was recognized by my desktop when I tries to sync the Palm handheld with Outlook on the desktop."
4590,"For the money, $3.99, this device is so nice. I can just drag and drop my photos into the folders of my choice. No camera software automatically starts running like it would when I would plug the camera into my USB port directly. I have a Canon SD550 and I couldn't figure out how to stop the automatic transfer of photos when I plugged the camera into my computer. It also needed the camera powered on during the transfer, draining the battery. I would highly recommend this little &#34;toy&#34;. It's powered by the USB port on the computer and you can put your stuff where you want it !!!"
4591,"No other stylus will do.  The metal mesh tip is vastly superior to rubber.  Rubber tipped stylus' I've used have intolerable drag.  This glides so smoothly across the screen it's like butter.  And no, it doesn't scratch.  Holds up well too--you'll lose it before you wear it out."
4592,"I have owned the BoxWave Apple iPad Capacitive Stylus for over a month now and so far it's done an excellent job. For one, the quality is excellent! It feels like a very nice pen. The clip is solid and I can't see it breaking off anytime soon.  The tip is a soft rounded semi circle. It's weird to write with at first, but after a few times you get used to it. I use it for taking notes in my notepad application and it gets the job done!Do not pay any attention to the review by ""Denise"".  It is clear that she works for TouchTec and has never owned the BoxWave stylus.  Even if the touchtec is superior over the BoxWave I would not purchase it just on sheer ""bad ethics"" on TouchTec's part. To have an employee, family member, or whatever write a poor review based on nothing is just awful!I can't say that I've compared this stylus to any others in the market, but this one definitely serves it's purpose and is good enough for me!"
4593,It`s everything they promised!!You can`t even tell it`s been added except the glare is gone!This totally completes my hubbies Christmas gift at affordable pricing.
4594,I like everything about this case.  It doesn't add too much bulk to my phone so it still fits in my car cradle.  The case seems to be built very professionally and is very attractive.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a real smartphone.. aka 'not an iPhone'.
4595,This has worked excellent with my canon G7
4596,"Does what it is supposed to do! No problems. Seems fast, but then I have never tried one of the slower SD cards in my Canon A720IS camera, so nothing to compare it to. Holds a boatload of digital pix!"
4597,Bought it for my step son and it it a great deal.For the size and price it works well and he likes it.The digital readout in nice but the rotary tuning wheel is not that precise.
4598,"I travel alot and once in a while I leave the charger in the hotel room, or forget it at home. I bought an extra one to keep in my suitcase. When charging at the hotel, I keep the camera near the charger so I remember to grab the charger when I pack. This charger is so small it's easy to lose it - funny how it's almost exactly the same size as the camera itself."
4599,"T.Stork said it all..This is the best you can get right now..People need to realize..Digital sound is digital sound no matter what u pay for it.Sandisk are already marvels at flash drives and memo ,,It was so simple for them to add a nice LCD display to a flash and a Nice machine is born..It should be a no brainer to pick this Newly underrated Champ of a machine..Be it the red, blue or silver model ,,depending on the memo u want,,U won't lose anything with sandisk..But u WILL save tha Dollar Dollar Bill...P.S..People complain of low volume on MANY mp3 players...Download an application called ""Mp3 Gain""..U can set your mp3 decibles up before u drop the tracks to your player..(I set the decibles to 97.0 before draggin' to tha red player..I let Iriver go up tha river and decided to chill on tha beach with Sandisk....."
4600,This is a great fan that I am using for a home Network attached storage box that I built. The fan is fairly quiet on the the lower two settings. The only downside is that no mounting screws were included.
4601,"No Problems with it yet.... Another product I purchased just to get my Computer Build up and running. If all you need is a HDD to start your computer, browse the net and normal every day stuff, i would purchase this. Id buy this again unless i had 100$ more to dump into a Velociraptor or  200+$'s more to buy a SSD"
4602,"It was time to replace the 500MB Western Digital drive in my desktop, so I decided to try this Seagate 1TB drive. It took nearly 2 hours to format in Windows to NTFS, but I've heard that's typical for Windows and it now runs fast and quiet (so far). Some older Seagate drives have known firmware issues, so Seagate's website allows you to enter the drive's serial number to confirm the firmware and get a firmware bios-flash update if needed. The drive I received was new enough not to need any upgrade. I've only given it 4 stars for reliability due to the fact that I've only used it for a month as of this post. There was no SATA cable or installation CD and the packaging was sparse, but I've ordered ""bulk"" drives from Company A before so I knew what to expect and I'm not complaining about it. Good hard drive, good price."
4603,"I purchased two of these drives from another vendor when they first came out. I've never had a problem with them, but I'm backing up everything just in case. It looks like the reviews are about 40% negative and 60% positive with nothing in the middle, which is not good. That tells me that the problem is either off or on and therefore likely to be a quality control issue.These drives are batch tested, like most mass produced items these days. Pressure from the ""bean counters"" upstairs leads to sample shopping, so batches that should be rejected are instead shipped. When that happens, production problems don't get fixed because there is no feedback. It's all about greed folks.History shows that Seagate knows how to make great hard drives, but right now their priorities are out of whack. Just be thankful they don't make peanut products or some of us might not be here. Still, I'm willing to take a chance since I was lucky the first time. I ordered two more drives and am keeping my fingers crossed. Hey, they're 1.5TB! ;-)"
4604,"I have been using a NEX2 CF card player for the last several years.  It is simplistic and bulky, so I choose the muvo for its size and features.pros:-very small, even smaller than I thought from the photos online-very lightweight-useful included software for folder management and converting your files back and forth from mp3 to wma and you select the bitrate.  for those of you still using mp3 on your player, like i was, WMA makes files much smaller and the software included in this player has a setting you can select so that all files are converted to WMA before being loaded on the muvo.  very useful.-can create, name, rename, delete folders with ease-I think the sound quality is great-I got the firmware update immediately(which was very easy)there is no static when the backlight is on.-fm radio works great.-the armband and protective case are quality and work greatcons:-I wish it had a sleep function-"
4605,"I did a little shopping around and comparison of makes and models.  I never purchased a similar item before.  This model turned out to be the perfect solution.  It was very reasonably priced and is very easy to use.  I bought it for my wife to use with her mp3 player.  It usually takes a few training sessions before she knows how to use most gadgets, but she was able to use this with very little instruction.  If you find that sound reproduction is less than optimum, simply dial in a new FM frequency and it should cure the problem."
4606,"For the price, I do not think you can exceed the sound quality.  Also they are very comfy."
4607,"This camera zooms from 28-200mm, accepts 49mm lens filters, 50- 800 ISO and a multitude of in-camera adjustment features. You also can switch the zoom to manual which is a huge plus. What more could you ask for from a point and shoot camera? Warning: the only rub with this camera is shooting at the Largest Image size = drains the battery very quickly. Better to shoot at 2560X1920 (battery will afford several hundred shots vs less than 50 with 3264X2448) If used correctly it is possible to take portrait shots with a background bokeh effect similar to what you would find with a DSLR 50mm portrait lens. Put the zoom on manual & pull it out to 200mm on your subject/head/body framed... This gives you a cropping factor of about 4x which equals about 50mm with full frame DSLR. Filters can be used for special effects or give you more realistic shots. Fill Flash can also be used."

I edited on Final Cut Pro and could composite 5 layers all above each other, each with a different opacity, and FCP's real time engine kept up without having to render! Thus, the compressed footage makes editing EASY - but Sony has managed to make a beautiful picture out of this stuff tooFor the Indie Filmmakers out there ---- test one out before purchasing..... I find the Sony HDV to be the most clear look out there --- emulating a beautifully shot NFL game on HD..... but for cinematic looks, I still may stick with the Panasonic DVX100, as there is a more cinema feel to that onehope that helpsHAPPY BUYING!!!!"
4609,The HDMI  cables I received work perfectly.  The price was a real bargin.
4610,
4611,"For the price, you can't beat them. I integrated these into my motorcycle helmet and they work great with the FIIO 6 and the FIIO L9 LOD cable. With this combonation, they work and sound great and are plenty loud enough to over power the many noises of riding a motorcycle."
4612,"I can't wear earbuds, and most headphones put too much pressure on my ears.  These are very lightweight, and because they slip around your ears there's no pressure at all.  I use them all the time, and can wear them for hours without discomfort.  The sound is great: warm and rich for such an inexpensive set.  I like that I can hear someone talking to me if I don't have them too loud.  As light as they feel, they stay securely on my ears, yet don't dig in anywhere.  The wires are fairly fragile-looking but as long as you're reasonably gentle with them they'll be fine. No hard kinks, don't jam them into a bag and throw stuff on top of them. I've gotten almost two years out of mine, with heavy use. You can buy spare foam covers too."
4613,"I prefer earbuds but my bf really likes over the ear headphones so I got these for him, he loves them. I tried them out just to test the sound quality and they sound just as good as my favorite pair of inner earphones and they're very lightweight and comfortable, just not my thing. If you like this style of headphones these are the best you're going to find for the price"
4614,"Good response in 10-30hz, and not for higher freq.In kit all what you need. System installation is easy.All in individual and very well made and safe (for this heavy pack) for transportation.So, is cool for big coach at home and no very suitable for small chair at condo :)If you planing use for one person only, may be better buy less powerful model."
4615,"If you're an audiophile and somewhat of a coneseuir of high quality headphones, you should know that most high-end headphones require a break-in period for the diaphrams to loosen up and provide the best quality sound the headphones can deliver.  Why?  I'm not entirely sure.  No other speakers of tradition design require such.  And I say traditional design, because instead of some of the modern speaker cone designs found in computer speaker systems the diaphram in these headphones actually is a ""standard-looking"" speaker rather than a cheap metal diaphram with limited sound reproduction capability.  Pull the ear foam off a cheap pair of headphones and take a look at the spiraled metal diaphram that consists of the ""speaker"".  With Grado headphones, you get get a real speaker in each ear piece.But what I'm saying with regards to the break-in period, allow them to get a thorough breaking in before you judge the headset.  Because I, myself, was beginning to question my investment.  I was also wondering if I had enough power driving the set.  I run them through the external ""remote"" for my amplified 5.1 speaker set for my PC, which has more power than the standard headphone jack on the PC itself. But as the headset breaks in the sound gets better and better.  I'm hearing things in songs that I never knew were there before.  Even through the surround speakers themselves."
4616,This case is great it keeps the IPOD safe from scratches. Buy this item you won't be disappointed.
4617,"After installing this case fan, my hard drive temperatures went down about 5 degrees Celsius from my previous case fan, which was a Zalman 92MM. The Zalman was silent, but it didn't move much air.  You can hear this fan, but the noise is not objectionable to me. It is rated at 35 dB(A).The fan has two connections (you can only use one): 1. a small three pin connector, which plugs directly into the motherboard (fan RPM is displayed if you enter setup at start-up), or 2. a four pin (Molex) power connector.  Initially, I connected the three pin connector to the motherboard, but the fan speed was only about the same power as the Zalman, which was not much, but it was silent. After I disconnected the three pin connector, and then used the four pin connector instead, it really moved the air (56 CFM), but then it was audible.Hard drives don't care much for heat; a lesson I painfully learned after my two year old hard drive failed a year ago.  Since my computer runs in a fairly warm environment, especially in summer, I'm glad I made this purchase.UPDATE:  As of 4/1/2012, this fan has been cooling my computer for more than two and a half years with absolutely no problems--hard drive or other."
4618,"My first computer was a Wintel and so were my second, third, and fourth. My brother decided to take the fourth one away from me just a couple of weeks ago, so I had an opportunity to buy a new computer. A few of my college friends were boasting about their Apple Powerbook G4s, and being the Wintel user that I've been all of my life, I was curious. I did a lot of research - looked at reviews, literally studied every tech specs on the Apple Powerbook website, asked around, etc. Then, OSX Tiger came out that week and every tech website that I went to was boasting on and on about how wonderful this  new operating system is. I decided that I HAD to give it a try and so I did!My Apple Powerbook G4 15"" came last week with an additional 512MB ram (1GB memory total) and I have to say, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Everything is amazingly easy and I love the dock! All of the programs that I use daily are only 1 click away and it makes my desktop looks uncluttered as compared to my Windows XP's desktop. Everywhere I've taken this baby, people have been amazed as to how thin and beautifully designed this is! Compared with other laptops, this baby is extremely light too! To think, my dad, who wanted me to stay with Wintel, wanted me to buy an 8lbs. Toshiba laptop. For my very petite size of only 5'0 and a little under 100lbs., I don't think I would've been able to carry that Toshiba in a shoulderbag around school. In addition, Apple makes wireless connection so easy to install and use! My friend, who owns an iBook with the same Airport installed in his computer says it's so easy to steal other people's wireless internet with an Apple. I don't know if this is true for Wintel laptops, but immediately when I'm near a place with wireless internet installed, my Airport automatically ""discovers"" it for me and I don't have to enter any usernames or passwords or anything! That's how easy it is. Not only does Apple make wireless connection easy to use, but a lot of Wintel users don't know that Mac is not as vulnerable to viruses as they are! About almost 75-95% of viruses created are made to target Windows users. This is why you don't hear any complaints about Macs affected by viruses. Now, isn't that wonderful?However, I do have some minor complains though. First, this laptop DOES get pretty warm if you set it down on a flat surface or on your lap even because of the aluminum metal. Just make sure you don't wear short shorts and it shouldn't be too hot or purchase a laptop stand. Secondly, I do miss the right-click option on Wintel a whole lot. Now, I always have to CTRL + CLICK everything if I want to right-click and it can be a chore sometimes.During my first week that I got this Powerbook, I was wondering why my battery life was so short since I only used iTunes, iChat, and Safari, and Airport wireless at the same time. I did some research and found out that the best way to maximize your battery's energy span is by FULLY DISCHARGING it, LET IT GO TO SLEEP, and PLUG IN THE POWER ADAPTER and let it charge until FULL. This should only be done once during your first week with your battery or any new battery. I've also read that if you're not using Bluetooth or Airport, remember to disable them so that you don't waste any energy.All in all, I'm very satisfied with my Apple Powerbook G4. I saved $200 with the Apple Education discount so if anyone is planning to buy one soon in the near future, remember to take advantage of the discount (even if you're not currently enrolled in school; just pick any school - a school your children go to or a school that you went to and you'll still get the discount)!  It cost me $2,050 total including the 1GB memory upgrade and tax altogether when it should've cost me $2250-$2300. This is a great investment and I hope any Windows user with curiosities about switching to Mac should go to the Apple store and try it out for himself!"
4619,"Wow! is what comes to mind When I opened the box for the first time, its so shiny and it really is a piece of Art more then a simple laptop.I found it more beautiful in person then I did on the ads, the black keyboard looks great, and again on the ad thought silver would have been better but no longer think that.Being the 1.6/80 model everyone was saying the speed will be slow...Not True! Just sold my 2.2 Macbook with 4G of ram, and this is almost the same.The screen, it is very bright more so then the current macbook, and to me seems much clearer.Fans run at 2400 RPMs, no noise or heat...48-57 degrees surfing and mail open.Charges to full in 3.5 Hours.The think that impresses me most is the built quality, I have had 6 Apple laptops this year including the Macbook Pro and lots of Macbooks, this is the best built by far.The track pad is so precise, and much better then my macbook.The thinness will amaze you.I am hooked :)UPDATE:I was given a 1.8/64 as a gift and wrote a review, that might interest people trying to decide if the SSD drive or HHD drive is right for you[...]"
4620,This is a replacement for one that came damaged. This is a bigger size and seems better made. Had it for about a month or more and used it a few times. This is no light weight screen so be ware.
4621,"Needed more memory for my PC...now installed, and works great..thanks so much my pc sure needed more memory seems to have speeded it up"
4622,"Servicing an older Compaq SR5110NX for a client thatcame with a stick of 512 oem ram which is never enough.Shopped around and since I've always had good servicefrom Crucial decided on this pair of 1 gig sticks making uptwo gigs. Since this unit was an update to W7 64 bit HE,it needed the 2 gigs at least.All was plug and play and definitely sped up the unit.I was pleased how much faster it became for an olderAthlon 64 3800 single core with just 2 gigs of new ramrunning off the same old 120 gig hard drive..Sure couldn't beat the price ! I recommend these sticksfor any upgrade that still uses old DD2 PC-5300. DD2 isexpensive which makes little sense, but oh well.Great service from the seller and as always, Company A."
4623,"Item arrived quickly, and works as expected. Recommend if you want older RAM at low prices. Corsair still a safe bet for memory."
4624,"I purchased this to replace a 6' cable that I was using with a 19"" tv (now I'm using a 42"", so I want to be a little further from the tv), this is alot thicker and heavier that the 6' cable. And seeing that it comes coiled up it tends to keep the coiled shape, that's something else to consider. But I've run it along a wall and bundled it with other cables with zip ties so that solved that problem. But the picture still comes through clear as ever, and it gives me some distance from the tv as well. This is something you wouldn't want running up the middle of your floor, but if you tripped over it I think it would survive."
4625,Well if you're an amateur like me the first thing you'll need to get used to is the focus distance. You need to be at least 3 ft away to focus. But once you are three feet away you can still zoom in on the subject and get a practical macro shot. I know everybody else has reported about weight and shot speed and such so I'll report something I found with it.Today for some reason no matter what I did I couldn't get a distant tree to focus at 150mm (the tree was about 30 yds away). All the shots came out really soft. I had a circular polarizer on so that darkened it up a bit. The aperture was 4.5 and about 1/125 on shutter speed.I'm just throwing it up that this thing's prime focus point at 150mm isn't at maximum aperture. But hey it's a cheap lens and it's absolutely wonderful for the price. I love it. :)
4626,I like this product i like that it has multiple plugs. It is very strong and works great no complaints with this product! I would recommend and buy again if need be in the future!
4627,"My slightly older Sony Vaio always sounded like an Airline Terminal. The loud fan inside ate power and stuggled to cool the older Pentium 4 processor.  I finally realized that the noise was caused by a fan which was sitting directly on top of the table, with no air to get inside. Raising the notebook to get access to air did not help. Then I found this Vantec LapCool3 on Company A, it quickly arrived from TigerDirect, and now the machine is always quiet and runs faster. I think this elegant USB devise is saving the life of my Vaio.  The notebook is a little bigger than the LapCool, so it's Maybe more wobbly on top of it, and the notepook is higher on the table, but these are not important gripes compared to the silence that we now have without my Vaio sounding like a jet engine."
4628,"I had to make an exchange for a ""generation 3"" model, in order to get it work with an iMac.  After that, it's great.  The company Bits LTD really stands behind this product.Thus, all my little warm transformers for speakers, docks, hubs and other accessories are a thing of the past.  This power strip auto-senses when the computer sleeps, and turns other stuff off also.  This auto-detection is both the strip's greatest strength, and the greatest weakness.  You may have to tune the device to get the switching to work right.Mac users: Mac OS X has various weaknesses that can prevent automatic sleeping... you may have to upgrade certain printer drivers or fiddle with mystery reasons for lack of sleeping.PC users: your PC has several sleep modes, most notably ""S1"" and ""S3"".  Many PC's come set to S1, which results in very little power savings in sleep mode (so little your power strip might not activate).  Switch it in the BIOS to ACPI mode S3 for much better savings.  Google ""S3 Standby Done Right""."
4629,I bought this at CompUSA for $150. I took it home and was blown away by the sound. It has 2 optical inputs which I absolutely love. My DVD player and Comcast cable box sound so nice. The remote is a little weird. There's some number buttons that don't do anything. Basically Im happy with this purchase for what I paid.
4630,"I love mine. It sounds great, even at high volume. Small and easy to store away. I use mine daily at my office. My original unit did indeed suffer from the shorting out described by others. Like any modern person, I immediatly went to the JBL website and searched for ""on Stage"". I quickly discovered that JBL was aware of a problem that affected units manufactured between certain dates. I entered my serial number, and Immediatly I had a prepaid shipping label to return it to them. I now have my free replacement and all is good. The only thing that would have made this better would be if they had sent me a replacement right away, rather than wait for the bad unit to be returned. I had no music for almost a week!This from JBL,JBL has discovered that a certain chip used in the production of some JBL On Stage units will fail under certain circumstances. Not all JBL On Stage products are affected. iPods are not affected and cannot be damaged by the problem. There is no safety risk to you. We have re-started production with a new chip. (...)"
4631,"I bought this router back in 2006 and i am still working with it, the signal range is good for my house where i put it in a central place.It has been working since i opened the box non stop and i only had to config it once. I play online games like World of Warcraft, use connections peer to peer to download( torrents which sometimes may be a little tricky setting the ports ), VOIP.I have 2 PCs attached to the router through Cat 6 cables and 3 by WiFi, the network works very good and all the computers has good lan and internet speed.It is compatible with my iPhone and none of my friends have had problems connecting to the WiFi when they come to visit and some of them has Macs. The router is very stable, even having a good ammount of machines connected, i don't remember a single time it has reboot or similar.I am very happy with the router and don't plan in changing it unless it stopped working."
4632,"Klipsch won me over in the past with their 2.1 and 5.1 systems, but I needed to get rid of the subwoofer (too much space, too much bass), and these beauties are great (and cheap). I have an extensive collection of music, ranging from classical to industrial, and it handles all of it with aplomb. It shines most with rock (try Point of Know Return -- takes me back to high school!), but it handles opera and symphonies, too.But let's get real. All this talk of inadequate ""soundstaging,"" etc., is ridiculous. These are not audiophile speakers. They're $99.00 speakers. And, for what they are, there is no competition (and I've listened to about a dozen others).Nicely designed with a small footprint, the ProMedia Ultra 2.0 System easily earns 5 stars."
4633,The price and quality are right on. Te protection features make this purchase easy. You may spend more but check the MOV rating first. Dollar for MOV this is the best buy.
4634,Thanks Logitech for this adapter!!! I'm now using my Creative Inspire 4.1 4400 from 7 years ago to my 40 inch Bravia. It's not true surround sound but it's definitely more powerful and sounds better than the built in 20 W speakers of the HDTV.I only paid $3.99 for this adapter from NU company. I am definitely satisfied with my very affordable home theater system for $3.99.
4635,"This is a very late review, but I am writing it to show how impressed I am by Zalman. I bought this heatsink back in 2006 for use with my Core 2 Duo E6600. It is a great heatsink, cools the processor way better than the stock heatsink and is very quiet.I decided it was time to upgrade my computer when Intel released the Sandy Bridge processors in January of 2011. To my pleasant surprise, I noticed that Zalman sells a cheap $5 upgrade kit for this heatsink to fit the new sockets from Intel. They even included some new screws and thermal paste, though I decided to use some Arctic Silver. Great, I don't have to buy a new heatsink!About a month or so ago the fan on my heatsink has worn out and has started to vibrate slightly, making an annoying noise. I emailed Zalman inquiring about replacing the fan. They told me to send $5 over PayPal to their outlet email for a brand new replacement fan, shipped. Another wonderful experience.I loved their heatsink when I first bought it, but after these two experiences, I am now a very loyal customer. Zalman is a great company and I will be buying all my heatsinks from them from now on.A note: This fan is voltage controlled while new motherboards have switched to PWM control for the CPU fan. I solved this problem by plugging my CPU fan into one of the chassis headers (still voltage controlled) and disabled the CPU fan warning on my motherboard."
4636,"When I got the board I thought It was the wrong one. I was fussing around filling out the return form, when my granddaughter (10) looked at the old boards and said. ""grandpa you have it upside down."" Yep, I did, and the new board snapped right in. It is hell, getting old..Be sure to use a static strap on your wrist to the computer.. The old mem boards would blow if you looked at them wrong. These new boards are pretty safe, but still better be safe than sorry...My old Gateway NX570(Vista) is really humming now.. Firefox (I remember the Gofer browser) loads much faster.A good test is the new Google Earth 6. The new ground level walk around mode will test your computer... GE works good with the new memory. But, while 1.5 gb is good,,, still could use another GB. Got to order another one."
4637,"I was initially looking to find a backup device to store our digital photos and music.  Burning CDs or DVDs is not very convenient when you want to backup a small number of photos every few weeks. Then I got an XBOX 360, which changed the requirements a bit.  While the xbox can show play your mp3s and photos on your high definition TV (which look fantastic), there are some pretty severe restrictions on how the xbox can do that, even with the 20 GB HDD installed.  For example, you can stream your pictures and mp3s from your pc to the xbox, but you can't copy your files directly to the xbox hard disk.  Luckily there is a work around.  The xbox can read from an external usb storage device.  So I wanted a backup device that can also be accessed by the xbox.The WD Passport fits the bill perfectly.  It comes pre-formatted as FAT32 (the xbox can read FAT32, not NTFS) so it works right out of the box.  It is powered directly from the USB port so you don't have extra cords hanging around.  Viewing photos directly from the drive is much faster than streaming over the network.  On some large photos (over 1 MB), there is a noticeable lag when the image is being transferred.  There is no lag when using the Passport.  The Passport is extremely quiet and with the rubber bottom, it fits nicely on top of the xbox and it can't be easily knocked off.  The disk may not be the fastest on the market (it uses 5400 RPM drive instead of a 7200 RPM drive), but it is definitely fast enough for my needs.If you need a portable backup device and want to use it with your xbox 360, this is the one to get."
4638,This little gem works fantastic in my Axim.  My previous card started acting weird and was losing data.  This replacement is great.  I can rely on it to hold my sensitive data and then can swap it into my camera and take over 300 high res pictures at 8 megapixels.No worries here.
4639,I bought this to use with my Garmin Geko 201 to update the firmware.  I ordered the cable and received it in short order.  The time from placing the order to it being in transit was fast.I used this cable with an older Keyspan USB serial adapter on a Mac OS X 10.4.11 and with Levono laptop with a different USB-serial dongle.  I have not had issues with either.  The earlier comments on the the friction fitting part on the Garmin are accurate.  Just use a little care with the rubber flap.  This is not a cable issue.I would not hesitate to use this vendor again.
4640,"This has to be one of the best inexpensive zoom binoculars I have ever seen, and the price is so reasonable!The magnification is fine, the optics are very good, and are sharp and clear. Focusing is near the zoom control, making this camera so easy to use.I bought it for bird watching and love them as they are a small pair of binoculars that weigh under 10 oz...very easy to carry in my jacket pocket.UPDATE:  3/3/14:  these have he'd up great and I like the quality of the glass and the lightweight more and more.  You can't go wrong at this low price.If my review was helpful, would you please click ""helpful""...thanks, you Rock!  ;-)"
4641,"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit."
4642,I don't really have anything to add to the many reviews on this product.I have two BC-900 and I'm mightily satisfied.
4643,"When I purchased the 2nd power strip for our rack, I was sort of apathetic to what I was getting.  Our 1st power strip is nothing special.  I honestly don't remember why I picked this one, but when I finally got around to installing and using it last night, I was really pleased with the convenient features.  First off, there's 3 status LEDs that are easy to see.  Who doesn't love more status indicating lights in their rack.  Secondly, the power switch on the right side of the strip actually has a flip down protective cover (not pictured)- which puts my mind at ease when someone is standing. too. close.  to. the. server. rack.  *twitch*  You get the idea."
4644,"Popped these into a 2009 Subaru Impreza WRX.Feeding these about 100watts RMS and boy, do they take it.Crossed at 80hz and 4khz (18db slope). These woofers actually crossed much lower than I expected (most 6.5&#34; woofers I've tried had to be crossed at 90-100hz due to the volume and types of (bass heavy) music that I listen to.Due to the price, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, and I always take the wattage (even the RMS ratings) with a grain of salt.These have been playing loud and clear for over a year now, and I'm still impressed by the sound (namely the solid mid-bass thump) they put out. Be aware that with an extended lower end, you may have to use some MLV and other materials to calm down the vibrations and flexing in the sheet metal in the door."
4645,"I ordered this bag to use with my Panasonic HDC-SD60K camcorder.  Besides the video camera, I wanted enough room in the bag to hold a spare battery, spare SD cards, HDMI cable, and an off camera battery charger.  Fortunately this bag turned out to be the perfect size.  Besides the actual camera compartment, it also has outside individual pockets where you can store items without coming in direct contact and damaging the camera.  The bag itself is of top quality construction and made with durable materials.  Once you know for sure that this is the correct size you need in a camera bag, you will not be sorry you purchased this one.  I'll never need another video camera bag while I have this camera.  Well worth the price I paid on Company A."
4646,"I have used many digital cameras over the years. I got this one right when it came out as a small in-purse supplement to my large-lens ""real digital camera"". The main camera had a gorgeous large lens, a super zoom, and was 5mp. I figured this one would be useful for times I was out and about and didn't have the real camera with me.Over time, though, I realized that I was using this DSC-P200 for pretty much everything. I do origami for sale and take tons of up close photos of origami creations. This camera was super for that. I run a birding website and take lots of photos of birds in trees. The camera was wonderful. I run a gardening site and take garden photos all the time. The camera worked like a charm!I go on many trips, to Alaska, to Hawaii, to the US West. There are all sorts of landscapes I need to take photos of - large cactii, glaciers, volcanos, and more. The camera has been brilliant in all situations. You can see years worth of photos from this camera on the lisashea.com travelogue area.The only reason I got another camera after this one is that it is *slightly* heavy and large in my purse. With the new credit card sized phones coming out, I moved up to an 8.1 megapixel camera that was slimmer and lighter. But I still find many features of this DSC-P200 to be superior than the new one I got. The DSC-P200 is just so easy to use, and the images are so nice in quality.Highly, highly recommended."
4647,wonderful and highly recommended for any digital photographer. Adds the look of ambient light when used to bounce. I do not take these off often. I am a professional photographer.
4648,This is a very fast memory card. It can keep up with my Rebel XT shooting 3fps.
4649,"i sit on a large chair using this product to hold my lap top.  it is light, sturdy and keeps my lap and lap top cool.  great buy for the price."
4650,"I have been using Olympus cameras forever it seems. I have the highly rated SLR 2100 Digital Olympus. Run a search on that camera on Company A and see the rating - I wish that Olympus would make that camera in a higher res. - but they don't so I was looking for a 10x zoom with higher res. - I wanted the lens always out - this makes it faster to turn on and be ready to shot - it is quieter and takes less battery not having to turn on and wait for a lens to extend. Also you can view the pictures using the view finder or the screen - I like looking at the pictures using the view finder, in bright light I see them clearly.It took a little while to get used to the settings and the locations of all the features but - after that - the moon is the limit - really I took the camera out last night with a full moon and digitally zoomed in on the moon and got a GREAT picture. It was sweet.... I will have to submit it for all to see.This is not a point and shot camera - you must take your time for the shot - but you can set the camera up for rapid shot and it will do almost as good as a point and shot camera. I set it up for rapid shot when catching action - and I will get some blurry so take enough shots :o) The best camera I have had for action rapid shots is my Olympus 3030 - that camera rocks and with having the SLR 2100 I have the best of both worlds... all but movie with no sound - and the low res. The Fujifilm S5200 5.1 will shot movie with sound and does a FINE job of that - you can not zoom while taking the movie shot - you must set up for that but - the quality is good. Sound is great - no camera noise - But reading a lot about cameras - no camera of this style will allow you to zoom in movie mode while shooting...Bottom line:I like this camera and glad I bought it - I have shots in time that will never again be seen without a camera - my young grandchildren shot in video with sound - and still shots that are GREAT - If you are not willing to spend over 500 or 1,000 dollars for a camera - I would recommend this camera. In fact I am going to buy one for my daughter for her birthday - that is how much I like this camera. But then I am not willing to spend the big bucks for a new camera.  Enjoy!!"
4651,This is an a great product plugged right into the factory harness and the colors that come out of the connector matched the ones on the radio I still checked to make sure but they all where right for the speakers. This fit a 2007 ford explorer sport trac xlt with out steering wheel controls. Didn't have to cut the factory harness that was a plus.
4652,"I made all of the connections from this harness to the aftermarket radio harness in about 30 minutes taking my time to do things neatly.  The fit was perfect on my 2001 Dodge Durango.  This doesn't have a ground wire because on my Durango, the ground from the chassis was attached to the exterior of the factory head unit (not to another cable).  So what I did was connect the chassis ground cable to the aftermarket stereo ground cable."
4653,"I purchased this camera about a year ago, prior to a trip to London.  I'd had a Canon Powershot previously.  This camera outdid itself!  I didn't have to charge the battery during my four-day trip to London, taking over 500 pictures.  The screen size is amazing, though difficult to see when outside and it's at all bright.  The camera is very user friendly, easy to set up and so easy to use.  Since then, several people have ditched their old digital cameras to buy one of these.The zoom is great, and I love that it tells you when you're switching from optical to digital zoom.This is a keeper!"
4654,"After wasting both time and money having 35mm film developed for decades, I made the jump to digial two years ago.  When Kodak introduced this compact little photo printer I was fast to take it home.  I'm not one to sit and read a manual cover to cover, but this unit is simple, all you need do is follow the simple instructions and you will be printing professional quality photographs directly from your Kodak digital camera in no time flat.  I especially love the feature that allows you to modify how many pictures are printed on one 4x6 print -- you can choose wallet size, mini sticker size or 3.5's -- this makes it convenient to include shots in greeting cards without printing full size pictures all the time.  The bundle pack can be purchased for under $350 and you'll get the camera along with this nifty printer dock plus a starter ink & paper set; also sold separately.  The icing on the cake is that Kodak lowered the price for the refill ink and paper cartridges so you can purchase a multi-pack for less than $40 on sale and print off 180 photos from one box.  All with the touch of a single button!  Awesome deal, no matter how you look at it."
4655,"I really am quite pleased with this Teac unit. Though it lacks a filtering option to rid old records from snaps and pops, this is a great unit. A must have for anyone with hoards of old vinyl records.I cataloged over 600 albums, and everyone is patiently awaiting copies of records onto CD.For me, the Teac paid for itself in the first 3 days. Wonderful for those without a computer who would like to trasfer music from record to CD. Its quite a blast from the past, to hear all the old music, complete with pops and snaps in the CD. This unit is extremely simple to use."
4656,I'm glad Company A has a big amount of any wire/plug  you need. Try going to Radio shack to buy these type of plug converters...... $$$$$$$$$
4657,for the money they work grate not the best but hell they r really cheap so u get what u payed for they work great as back up sound to carry the sound with full and bass speakers so for the money yes I like
4658,"This is by far the best gadget I've ever bought.  It's gotten me places I had no idea how to get there.  Mapquest is good, but reading it while you are driving can be very dangerous.  I only wish I had bought the next model up which tells you verbally the name of the next street to turn."
4659,"Tengo un Toshiba Satellite con Windows Xp Home, la cual venia con 256 mb de memoria, era una tortura usarla con esa capacidad. Le agregue 512 y mejoro, pero siempre era lenta. Me decidi a ponerle la mayor capacidad de memoria que soporta, revise el sitio de toshiba y luego busque la memoria recomendada aqui en Company A, el precio muy bueno. En cuanto le instale la nueva memoria era increible la velocidad, ahora arranca en mas o menos 30 segundos, se apaga en 15 segundos y es una maravilla trabajar en ella. Realmente estoy convencido que para mejorar el desempe&ntilde;o de cualquier laptop hay que agregarle la mayor capacidad de memoria que soportan.Muy satisfecho con esta compra, ademas es Kingston recomendada por el fabricante de la laptop."
4660,"I have bought these before, and always had great luck, never ended up with a 'coaster'.  However, the Light-Scribe labeling seems to work best with HP burners (who invented Light-Scribe, of course).  So if you're going to use these with a Light-Scribe burner, I recommend these if you have an HP light-scribe enabled drive.  Other drives will work, like LG, etc, but you don't get labels that are as sharp or clear, or with as much contrast as you do with HP burners, for some reason.  Anyway, this about the discs, not burners, so I recommend these discs, as Verbatim seems to make the best LIght-Scribe discs.  I've tried other brands and other colors, but I didn't get as good of results as with these."
4661,"I almost purchased the 42 instead of the 32, but after checking them out at the store I decided on the 32.  The Samsung 353 was also in the running but one look in the store and I knew Sony was the way to go.  I am glad I decided on the 32 because the only real difference was the CCD, which is 340k instead of 680k effective.  It turns out the 32 does such a good job with the 340k I can't tell the difference, and for $150 less.  The other only real difference is the color viewfinder on the 42, but who uses a viewfinder anymore.  It doesn't come with a firewire (iLink) cable so be prepared to purchase one, especially if you have a mac.  I am happy with our choice and look forward to many edited videos to share with the family."
4662,"This is about the lightest pair of 12X25s you can find. The optics are very good, I do not hunt so I cannot compare them to more expensive units, but I did some dusk owl hunting in a group and I did get to compare these against some 50 mm objectives and did not notice a perceptable difference in brightness.For hiking and birding I think these are tough to beat. I know some say that 10X is good enough for birding and that more is too much, but I have not had a problem with these."
4663,I had it over two years...or three or four???  I cannot remember. But it still works great. Last long time with one charge.
4664,Works perfect. I recommend this to anyone looking for a product like this. Cheap and very reliable.its a bit short but still gets the job done
4665,Ordered it to hook computer up to TV. Works just like it should. For the price I should have ordered more
4666,It doesn't matter if you spend $5 or $50 on an HDMI cable cause they all work the same! This one did the job. I have been using it for years now and it still works perfectly. I think I paid 2 bucks for this one.

4673,"This camera is one of the first models since Hewlett Packard changed its OEM factory.  Intitially photo file sizes were so large that many users were unable to easily or quickly send pictures, but as more and more people are using High Speed Internet Connections, such as cable or dsl, the larger photo files have become less of a problem.Photos generated by this camera can also be sent directly to a photo quality printer for immediate printing without the use of a computer."

4676,"Easy installation.  Excellent sound quality. Performs as advertised.  Needed to contact Sennheiser, customer service with a technical question. Did not have a long waiting period before being connected to an adviser. The adviser was friendly and my question was answered immediatly. Should be noted that I had no problem understanding what the adviser was saying. The customer service facility is here in the USA."
4677,"I found this cable made it a heck of a lot easier to get under my wallboard. I found no signal loss. It was hardly more expensive than the standard cable, so I would probably get this in most cases."
4678,"This is a no-frills product, which ensures that it does exactly what it's advertised to do. And it does that very well.Sound quality: I have a stock speaker system in my car, not one worth thousands of dollars. While I can't speak to hi-fi car audio, for my purposes it's perfectly fine.Ease of use: you simply plug the 3.5 mm jack into your audio player, and slide in the cassette into the deck. Easily adjustable to accommodate both front and side-loading types.I've used it for months without any issues. The build quality seems adequate."
4679,I am not sure what is that people having problem with this thing but it works perfect on my car without any issues. The previous cassette i had got some wire issues so i got this and it works just fine! Give it a try your self before taking actions on basis of the reviews! Thank you!
4680,"It connected to my iPod Classic with no problems, and that's all I was asking for. And it came at a great price, much cheaper than at the Apple store."
4681,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It's nice and small so you can easily carry it around. Also, we've tried it on our Midnight desktop and his HP laptop and it works perfectly on both of them. With the recent rebate, the 1 GB storage and the excellent price, you can't go wrong!"
4682,"I bought this mp3 player a year ago to use on my school bus. It's tiny, so it takes up hardly any space & I use velcro to make sure it doesn't slide around.One reviewer complained it wasn't loud enough, and quite frankly, I have NO idea how loud they want it to go, because I can hear it just fine. In fact, the loudest volume is too loud, even over the extremely noisy bus!The sound quality is very good, and the battery life is excellent. I charge mine every weekend just to make sure it doesn't ""poop out"" on me mid-run, but I probably could go longer between charges.I've got between 50 and 60 songs on it, and I just change them every few weeks or so. Since it isn't USB 2.0, it does take awhile for the songs to upload, but you people who complain about that probably are too young to remember waiting while you recorded your lp's to cassette so you take them in the car with you (now THAT was slow.)I did have to push reset once: I was scrolling backwards through songs too fast and it got ""hung up."" Since I had to reload all my songs, I haven't repeated that...if I have to go backwards, I do it SLOWLY, one song at a time.Someone mentioned that it didn't remember that it had been told to play in random order. I haven't found that to be true, but it DOES start on the same song every time, so I just push the forward button once and it starts going randomly from there.I was showing mine to my coworkers, and at least two of them are buying them as soon as they can find them. I would buy one again if I lost this one."
4683,This kit will clean and prepare your CPU or heatsink in order to apply the thermal paste. It is a no-sense product. Can be used several times.
4684,I purchased 8 of these drives for personal use. What you get is value for money no bells and whistles. That is he reason we buy Flash drives to store information and have it readily available. The drive is super fast and reliable and it looks good and feels good in you hand. They are not made from those cheap plastics they are robust. I have them now over a month and they are really fantastic.
4685,"Bought this for my wife before a visit out west. We used it taking photos of the Grand Canyon and some other natural scenery. The lens works great, was very affordable in relation to other lens. My wife is a novice so I didnt want to spend a fortune, and she loves this lens..."
4686,"This lens is the best quality lens for the price available.  What I mean is, out of any cheaper wide angle lenses out there, it would be best to spend the few more dollars for this lens.  It comes with a carrying case and hood which is extra nice; considering Canon is charging hundreds more and for whatever reason cannot bring themselves to giving anything away for free.  Speaking of Canon, I'm a Canon guy all the way, and this is the first time I considered straying from Canon Products.  I'm really glad I did.  The reviews on the Canon lens are too iffy to justify paying 200-400 more for roughly the same lens. The photo examples don't give me any justification to pay that kind of extra money either. Some reviews on this lens also seem to be a bit negative, but unless your shooting with the big boys, theres no outstanding reason to upgrade to a more expensive wide angle, as this will cover all of your needs with great clarity and color.  The only real fault that is noticeable with this lens is that amount of distortion at the edges at 10mm.  This is to be expected with such a wide lens, and can simply be solved by shooting closer to 12mm..etc.  However, in some cases, the 10mm distortion actually works in your favor to enhance the height of trees, buildings, and that sort of thing.  (Examples of this exist in the photos regarding this lens).Certainly consider reading others reviews, and go to Canon's lens reviews as well, so you can make your own decisions.  I just hope this helps in deciding if its worth spending the extra cash for Canon.  Happy hunting!"
4687,"Terrific speakers for the price.  When used in the appropriate and recommended constraints, these speakers sound like they cost way more that what Company A sells them for.  I have owned a pair for a couple months now and have held up to harsh weather outside extremely well, still sound great, and haven't noticed any sun fading or any flaw so far.  Without a doubt I would recommend these speakers for people looking to add to their outdoor music setup."
4688,We bought this because I wanted to see if it really works. We have a older flat screen TV dvd combo and the dvd player quit working and we did not know why. I though I would try to insert the Dvd cleaner into it and just see if that would help. Wouldn't you know after 3 times cleaning it works now. That has saved us money so we don't have to buy a new one.I recommend this to everyone who has a dvd player.
4689,It is a little heavy and a bit stiff on the zoom function.  For the money you can't go wrong.  I am happy with it. Seem to be a good image.  I am not a expert but I am not beginner either. Most folks would be satisfied.
4690,"Got this to have as a ready spare for my Canon SD1400 compact. It fits fine and costs a fraction of what you'd pay for one from the camera manufacturer. So far it has been holding up identically to my original battery, but to date I've only run it through 3 use/charge cycles. Only time will tell if how it compares to the original which is a couple of months older. At the comparative cost though, it's really going to have to annoy me to send me somewhere else. Mine arrived with a printed label wrapping it as opposed to the image in the ad. This makes it fit marginally tighter than the original battery, but has not been an issue and makes it somewhat less prone to being dropped when removing it from the camera vs the original which slides out more freely. Unlike some other equivalent batteries out there, this is rated the same capacity as the original. Not sure if that is a decision factor for anyone since there is not a lot of difference and how many shots you'll actually get is dependent upon a lot of other variables while using your camera in additon to battery construction, so as with all things battery powered, YMMV."
4691,Everyone should have a spare battery for their camera.  Purchased the spare at the same time as the camera.  Couldn't beat the price anywhere!
4692,"This is a great bag for carrying a lot of gear including your laptop on the go.  Plenty of room, build quality excellent.  The only grip I have about the bag is $$$ and once its loaded with all your equipment and a laptop it can be very heavy but that's the trade off you get when carrying everything.  I have 2 SLR's, 3 lenses and accessories; all fit with no problem with room to spare.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants something that is going to last them for a long time.  This is my second back from Lowepro."
4693,Waterproof and the perfect size fore a macbook pro 13'. Very padded and fits nicely into a backpack slot for laptops. The zipper is also easy to open and close and has not broken so far in the past 7 months of constant use.
4694,"Nice to have a high quality, EFS prime macro lens.  Image quality is exceptional, fast 2.8 makes for slim DOF and nice bokeh.  Focussing distance is a little longer then I would have thought, but this is just something to get used to.  Lens is rather small and light."
4695,"The Canon BG-E3 grip was a good add-on for my XTI, it doubles the life of your battery, adds a little weight to the camera and makes it easier to handle (for me - the camera felt like it was always small and light) and adds a few buttons on the side so you can control the camera just as well when shooting horizontal or vertical.Also a nice thing is it includes the battery tray to use standard AA batteries if you find yourself out in the wild without a charger, could come in handy."
4696,"In this review I may sound somewhat critical of the TV, because it is not perfect. But understand that it is probably the best you can do for the money, the thin profile, picture quality and a few other criteria I had. I give it a full score with the thinking that if you take into account these parameters you will automatically exclude other offerings that may give you a better picture. And rankings are supposed to be relative to what you would get given your constraints. So scoring at less than full score would imply I could buy a better TV within the constraints I had, which is simply not the case as far as I could research.After looking at too many models of both LCD and plasma, I settled on a narrow choice of either the new generation (V-shaped bottom bezel) Samsung LCDs, Sharp Aquos LCD, Sony LCD or Pioneer or Panasonic plasma. LCDs are definitely more focused/sharp than plasma, so this I count as a plus. Also they are higher resolution even in the 32"" - 45"" sizes where the 42"" plasmas are only 1024/768 (in most cases).I was pushed to buy a new TV because my old one is almost unwatchable at times and requires vigorous tapping to steady the picture increasingly often. Had this not been the case, I'd have probably waited a year or so to see where the truly HD resolution displays are going (e.g. the ones capable of displaying 1080 progressive signal natively, without re-scaling, as opposed to just 1080 interlaced or lower resolutions as most of today's screens do). But may be a while before such displays become affordable enough to justify the wait anyway...I looked at Enhanced Definition TVs as well since when watching from over 8 feet they are very hard to distinguish from a High Definition sibling of the same make, while being up to 30% cheaper. But at the end, critical viewing at around 8 feet or closer is something that happens in my home, so I decided that I would be unsatisfied being able to see pixels on the screen on the ED models. If you are not very critical or your vision is not perfect, an ED TV may be all you need.I got the Panasonic TH-42PX50U 42"" TV only a few days back based on the following strengths this TV offers (more details on each point follow in the review):- Picture was closest to ""natural"" looking among comparably priced plasma sets- Good black level detail- Built-in over the air HDTV tuner (NOTE: Company A's description says ""HD-Ready Plasma TV"" when in fact this is an integrated HD TV with a built-in tuner)- 42"" is probably the optimal size for my room- ""Rumors"" that Panasonic has good reliability- Price was competitive with other plasma and better than similarly sized LCDHere are some more details. I simply got a very good deal, so for what I paid this is unquestionably the best TV out there. I got an open box from Circuit City for about a $1,000 less than MSRP and a couple of hundred less than ANY online retailer I've seen. Plus interest free 24 month financing and the peace of mind I can return with no penalty or loss of any kind within 30 days.If you have to pay close to the MSRP, and especially if you do not use the built-in over the air HDTV tuner then the choice is not that clear - I would seriously look at the new Samsung LCD and Sony and Sharp offerings (in that order) as an alternative or some of the Pioneer plasma.If you need features like memory card slots, picture in picture, channel guide etc., then look for the xxx500 version of the same TV for a premium of $500 or more. As for me, these are not especially useful so I'm glad that Panasonic sells a model without them for a lower cost.The picture is indeed pretty well calibrated out of the box compared to most other sets I've seen. There are three preset modes and the Standard is closest to my liking (Vivid is too artificially bright and sharp, Movie is too dark, but may be used in a totally dark room). I've played with the user adjustments a bit and did not have to change much off the Standard preset. I got to the Service Menu too and played with some of the settings there, but again did not need to do major adjustments.I've settled on the ""Standard"" picture preset with just a slight (-2 points) adjustment of the tint control in the user menu after a small -5 points adjustment of the tint control in the service menu. I would not call the picture completely ""natural"", but it is close. If anything, it is a bit film-like in terms of being slightly warmer than life on skin tones. It is very watchable, so no big complaints there. Especially if you take this in prospective of what you get from other sets, I think this is one of the better pictures out there for the up to $5K price range, bar a very few CRT behemots, which do not even come in this screen size anyway, or a few non-integrated plasma or LCD TVs that may have some aspects of a better picture.One of four minor flaws I've found so far is the very light greenish tone on some yellow objects and a slight red emphasis that emerges if you eliminate the green through the tint adjustment. So I'm not sure if this is a green or a red push, but it takes away some of the naturalness of skin tones. In the US market slight red push is the norm anyway so most folks won't notice it. And if you compare to other brands, it is not that bad at all. Of course, you will never get the perfection of the latest Sony XBR tube sets in terms of natural colors and black level detail, but you gain a thin profile and settle for a very decent picture.The second flaw is the lack of true deep black resolution. The blacks are quite close to a good black and this TV has one of the deepest blacks I've seen on a plasma TV. It is close to a tube TV for over the air HDTV. Where it falls short of the ""ideal"" is in its ability to resolve details in dark areas. Basically a black suit sometimes may appear as a black spot, rather than showing all crevices and fabrics details. What you see is still quite better than what you can see on almost any LCD and most plasmas, so I do not think you can do much better than this unless you go to a tube TV. It is just something that you need to be aware of and to not expect perfect black AND shadow detail at the same time. Increasing brightness and backlight levels can increase the details in dark scenes, you can gain shadow detail, but you loose deep blacks. I considered getting a cheaper flat TV but the inability to display decent dark level information in most of them (as well as in most expensive LCDs) plus the quite un-natural skin tones in almost anything sub $2,000 were the primary decision points for me to go with the Panasonic plasma set. In a brightly lit room the lack of deep black (e.g. the presence of gray background instead of black) may be OK, but I find it very distracting in a dark room. So the trade-off that Panasonic did by displaying fairly deep blacks and losing some of the very deep shadow detail is in my opinion a better choice given the constraints of the technology.The third flaw is that this TV is not totally silent. I do not hear any fan noise from the back of the TV. But there is electronic hum (not from the speakers but from high-voltage components) that is audible if you are in a totally quiet room and you mute the speakers. This is more audible if the picture is brighter, so it seems to be related to the ""strain"" the TV components exhibit which is related to how bright the picture needs to be. Again, this is not much worse compared to the annoying high-pitched noise coming off ALL tube TVs. And it is not really audible if you have even a little sound coming off your speakers during normal viewing. You certainly can't hear it over the background noise in a store or in most normal TV viewing.The fourth flaw is that the sound system on the TV is nothing special. While it is better than what you would find in most sub $1,000 TVs and is usable for casual TV watching, it is not a high-res system and certainly worse than most other $3K+ HDTVs out there. Low and low-mid frequency is OK for a TV speaker but the most important mid-range and highs are not well defined and the sound is muffled and unintelligible at times. A $300 home theater in a box will give you better sound and may be worth the investment, especially as the TV has an optical audio out. In my opinion most home theaters in a box under $2,000 are garbage in terms of decent sound quality, but you draw your own conclusions. As far as I'm concerned, if you have almost any sound system, even a decent boom box or a shelf system, it will be better than the built-in speakers.The remote is mostly fine with me - it is large, comfortable, intuitive and fully back-lit at a push of the glow in the dark back-light button. Access to most features is easy, but some dedicated buttons are missing - I would like to be able to switch inputs or set the picture defaults through the remote rather than through a menu on screen (although the menu is intuitive and quick enough if you do not do it more than a couple of times a day).The over the air tuner seems to be good - it gets all analog stations that my 10 year old Panasonic gets, plus about 10 digital stations in the Washington DC area with only an old non-amplified rabbit ear antenna. The digital channels come in perfect, and standard analog channels (SD) seem comparable to the tube TV it replaces (e.g., quite bad). The only drawback is that the size of this TV is double compared to a 20"" tube TV it replaces so that you see more of the garbage in analog signals. But if you get farther away it is comparable if not better looking. So SD is handled quite well as far as I'm concerned.A PDF manual is available off the Panasonic web site, so you can check the specs and read more about the functions. The manual does not explain why would you want to do many of the things it covers, but is otherwise detailed enough to tell you how to do them.For a LOT of chatter go to avsforum.com"
4697,Installs in a snap. Perfect fit for factory wiring. No need to splice wires to install your new speakers in your Jeep.
4698,"These earphones are very accurate and smooth.  At times they can sound clinical.  I know that this particular model is not supposed to require a headphone amplifier, but it is my opinion that a headphone amplifier really makes a positive difference with these earphones.  They continue to sound very accurate, but they have greater bass presence.  They still do not have an overly bassy sound like those wretched Bose earphones, but they do sound a touch warmer.Fit on earphones is absolutely essential.  you must have a seal or they just do not perform.  Due to the design of the earpieces, they insert deeply into the ear, but not enough to physically damage the innerds of your ear.  It does take some getting used to, but it absolutely worth it.The packaging is really quite nice.  I like the fact that they come in a plastic case that is really sturdy.  I always put them back in the full case (okay, I am anal), but the package comes with a small traveling case that would fit in a pocket.Don't be concerned that the headphone amplifier takes to much space.  I have a small headphone amplifier that fits with my Ipod Classic (both the 60 gig and 160 gig models)in the breast pocket of a standard Oxford cloth or broadcloth dress shirt (yes it looks nerdy).  If the music starts to sound crackly using the headphone amplifier and that crackle is not normally there, it usually means that the headphone amplifier needs a new battery or needs to be recharged.All in all, I cannot say enough good things about the Etymotic ER4 P and the ER4 S (I have them both)as long as they are supplemented with a headphone amplifier."
4699,"I actually purchased these headphones as a back-up pair, since they were cheap, and I know I can trust the quality of Sennheiser. I've spent about 10 hours using these headphones, watching tv, listening to music, and a little bit of gaming. These headphones are definitely not THE BEST, but they are REALLY good. They are as cheap as Sennheiser gets for over-ear cup headphones(as far as I know), but they're still quite good. I've owned about 4 other pairs of headphones, that were back-up pairs, but these are by-far the best. If you're looking for a good pair of headphones, that won't break the bank, look no further. Don't buy into that skullcandy or dr. dre crap."
4700,"Does just what it says - allows you to use your ipod in the car and transmit the sound over the FM band to your car radio. It does not charge an iphone, but does work with one.  Only problem in my area is that every single channel on the FM band is taken by a radio station so I get bleed over all the time.  Works better on the interstate between towns."
4701,"I bought one for my dlink router about a year and half ago and it filled the whole house with signal.  I have a 3 story home and my router is on the first floor and my laptops are on the second & 3rd floors and all of them get full 5 bars of signal.  a month ago, I bought a d-link audio/video streamer that has a weak signal so I bought this antena one more time to enhance the signal received by the streaming device and it has performed very well.. one happy customer"
4702,"This device can be used to:- Listen to music i.e. instead of an ipod.- Record audio (with a microphone, not included)- Function as external disk, when connnected via USB to a PC.It uses 1GB removable disks which sell for about $7 each (plus shipping).  As a audio recording device, it is unique for its capabilities in this price range, and essentially substitutes for a DAT (digital audio tape).  The device has a line-in and microphone analog inputs.  You can record in one of the three formats:  high compression (Hi-LP), low compression (Hi-SP), and uncompressed (Linear PCM).  The recording times per disk are 34 hours (Hi-LP), 7 hrs 55 min (Hi-SP) and 1 hr 34 min (Linear PCM).  The compressed formats are stored in a proprietary Atrac format developed by Sony, which are basically are only of use on this device.  Thus most crucial and invaluable feature, however, is that for audio recordings made from an analog microphone, you can convert the recording to the open .wav format when you upload the recording to your computer.  The upload requires the SonicStage software which comes bundled with the device.  There is pointless restriction that you can only upload the audio file once to your PC, but then you can convert it to the open wav format (the uncompressed CD quality Windows format), and then you are home free--you can do whatever you want with the audio file i.e. make an unrestricted number of copies, copies of the copies, edit the file using sound software, burn CDs, whatever.  The sound is exceptionally clear; I use the ECM-719 Sony microphone (this is great mic, the cable is almost 6 feet long however which is a little too long for my preference).  I generally record at the Hi-SP level, and it sounds great.  For no loss of fidelity due to compression, you can record uncompressed and still get 1.5 hours on a disc.  The manual warns that the device should be plugged in when recording, due to high battery consumption while recording, but I have used it off the battery for short periods with no problem.This device does incorporate SCMS (serial copy management system), which puts all kinds of restrictions on copying digital files.  As mentioned previously, you can only upload your analog-source recordings once to a PC, which is not really a problem as long as nothing goes wrong during the upload, and there is no particular reason why it should.  As far as MP3s or other digital music, you can load them onto the device, but you can't copy them again after that i.e. back to the computer.  The MP3s are not converted to another format, this device can read them directly so there is no loss of quality.  You can also copy uncompressed audio to this device, or you can compress it into the ATRAC format to save space.  The highest quality compressed format is ATRAC3Plus, which reduces files size to about 20% of uncompressed, and sounds very, very good.  It is supposedly better than the highest quality MP3.  ATRAC3Plus is the format used by the Hi-SP recording mode also.This device also has an extra battery holder which holds on AA battery an can power the unit in the event your rechargable battery fails.  This is an exceptional feature; it means that as long as you bring some AA batteries with you, you will be able to power the unit.The reliablity of the interchangable Hi-MD disks appears to be exceptionally good.  They are basically infinitely re-recordable; Sony claims you can re-record 1 million times.  They are encased in a well made enclosure, well protected unlike CD-RWs or DVD+RWs.  I would guess they are much, much more reliable than CD-RWs and DVD+RWs.  They are also quite compact, and make a good replacement for thumb drives, or can be used to back up files.  For example, you can use it to back up the wav files from your recordings.  Howevery audio files, copied directly to the Hi-MD disks cannot be listened to on the device, you have to download them using the SonicStage software.  The songs you download are then placed into the some special files on the disks which contain the song catalog, and all the music--i.e. you cannot manage the songs/audio on the Hi-MD through the Windows file system.  This was probably done because of the SCMS restrictions, to prevent from copying audio at will.  This is an annoying restriction which means that if you want back ups of your audio on the Hi-MD disks, you must do extra work and consume extra disk space--i.e. backup your MP3 or wav files to the Hi-MD disks as Windows files (which cannot be listened to directly).When the device is connected to your PC it gets power from the USB cable, and actually appears to even recharge the battery while connected.  The LCD screen is adequate but has no backlight, Sony makes a lit version for the next model up from this one, for another $100.  You need to basically angle the player reflect off the main light source to see the screen.  This is not really a problem for me, but the lighted display is probably more convenient.  The fit and finish, as with all Sony devices, is excellent.  The battery life when used as a player is quite long, they claim up to 34 hours; reports on the internet report that 20+ hours is common.In summary, the only downside to this device is the SCMS restrictions, but generally you can still do everything you want to do.  In particular, you can record audio from a mic (or from any analog input using the line-in; i.e. old cassettes) and make unrestricted digital wav files out of them."
4703,"Just got the 5D..traded in my 20D...the 5D is a more solid camera with a full frame sensor...pictures are great and it is easy to use if you are familiar with the Canon system...a little pricey, but worth it!!  You'll use it for years!"
4704,"The Canon EF 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM telephoto zoom lens replaces the first Image Stabilizer lens of its kind, the Canon 75-300mm f4-5.6 telephoto zoom lens. It offers now up to three - as opposed to two - apertures in image stabilizing mode, as well as slightly wider focal length. The current June 2006 Popular Photography issue has a fine test report on this lens, showing that it is capable of excellent contrast and resolution in the range from 70mm to 200mm; at 300mm, both contrast and resolution decline slightly to very good, but still an excellent result for a zoom lens in this class. It is also fully compatible with Canon's digital SLR cameras (112-480mm equivalent), with improved lens coatings optimised for digital sensors. Without question this is an excellent lens for the Canon photographer interested in excellent nature and landscape photography, without resorting to a sturdy tripod to hold both the camera and lens; thus it is also quite suitable for handhold panning shots at most outdoor sporting events held under good weather conditions."
4705,"Not sure what makes this stuff Arctic - it didn't feel cool to the touch.Or Silver - it looks kinda off-white.Or Ceramique - it is a fairly thin liquid.Or High Density - it is about as dense as toothpaste (maybe less).I guess it is a  Thermal product since it is made to conduct heat.It definitely looks like a Compound some sort.Can't comment on the Premium claim,  since I have experience with other Premium brands much less the generic ones.Easy to use. Applied on heat sinks of a new replacement fan, it appears to be doing its job.Cool as a cucumber ....Maybe it should called&#34;Arctic Cucumber Thermal Compound&#34;What more can I say"
4706,"I find that blowing the dust bunnies out of my 'puter on a regular basis keeps it running cool and fast.  The price delivered was better than I expected, and saved me a trip to my local Radio Shack store to get another can.I will probably purchase these again in the future when I need to replenish my supply.  I got a couple of years out of each of the other cans I have had in this size.  Good value.Clint."
4707,"As an owner of an MX510 as well as this MX518, I can't tell the difference between the two.  However, for some reason the MX518 is a bit cheaper and has a larger resolution.  I completely recommend the MX510, so I can say the same for this mouse.  It's about as good as they get!"
4708,"I have used this webcam for a while now with my laptop. Works great, very portable, comes with a nice pouch to store it in.Love the quality of the picture, and the fact that one can manually set the focus."
4709,"The DVD Player arrived within the time promised, in excellent condition, as I have come to expect from Company A. It worked well right out of the box, and I have no cause for complaint. Operation is easy, picture is excellent, and sound is very good. I will have no reservations about giving this as a gift. It works."
4710,"Got a hot laptop? This fan drops the temperature of my laptop by at least 20 degrees. I'm sure it could be used for other things, like game consoles. The retracting cable makes it easy to store or transport, and of course you can't beat Thermaltake quality."
4711,"I have an external hard drive that is ""air-cooled"" but it is in a location where air circulation is somewhat blocked. This little fan takes care of that problem and keeps it running cool. I had tried battery-powered fans, but the batteries would die too quickly. If I'm not using the external HD, I just reposition the fan to provide extra circulation for the tower.This fan is extremely quiet and works unobtrusively. I don't even hear it running.  Since I normally shut off my computer when I'm done, I'm not really bothered by the lack of an on-off switch.This fan is a great solution to one of life's annoying little problems. :-)"
4712,"A lot of people take very good care of their discs.....I'm not one of them.Here a cd.There a cd.Everywhere a cd,cd.Cd's on the floor.Cd's on the fridge.Ok, I'll stop. I think you get the picture.Enter the Skip Doctor.I used to have the old, green hand turn version and that one saved many of my cd's.I like this new one better, just pop the disc in, let it spin and you're done.Is it a cure all?No, some skips are so deep not even this can fix them.Now, that said, even if you can get the disc to read I found a program called EAC (Exact Audio Copy).Look it up. It's free and will fix even the most scratched cd so you can save a perfect mp3 to your computer.Of course The Skip Doctor will help get you that perfect copy that much quicker.The Motorized Skip Doctor.Reasonably priced, effective, highly recommended."
4713,This item is just what I needed and does its job and does it right the quality is perfect I have no complaints and the shipping time was very fair about 4 days
4714,"I use this headset to talk to friends when we play games together. I had to buy this so that I could whisper instead of talk into my laptop.The headphones are VERY comfortable and work very well. I can whisper and my friends can hear me just fine. The headphones are also incredibly durable, as I've dropped it on the floor several times and it had yet to be damaged.It's also very portable, and easy to carry around if necessary.Very good headphones, I highly recommend it if you're into using skype/google plus/gaming chat."
4715,"I got the 100 disc spindle.ImgBurn says these are Manufacturer ID: MCC 03RG20, which is among the best.Mine are Made in U.A.E., too, but I've had no problems with then as long as I used a slower burn speed, which you should do with any media if you get bad burns.There is a burn speed sweet spot with any media/drive combination, and more often than not, it is your drive's fault more than the media's.  With my circa 2006 Midnight laptop's Sony DVD drive, I get bad burns with ANY brand DVD-R media if I go greater than x4.  At more than x4, I get a dark to light banding issue with any brand media.  That dark to light band transition is where many DVD players will freeze during movie playback.  If I burn at x4 on this drive, all is good.My circa 2006 Toshiba laptop has a MatsuSHITa drive in it than seemingly can't burn anything well.  Those drives have known issues.Many people recommend using a x4 burn speed with any single layer DVD media for reliable burn.  This of course can depend on your DVD drive.  You might be able to go faster.  It'll take about 15min to burn a full disc at x4.Bottom line is that you should try a different burn speed, or a different burner before blaming the media."
4716,"Been using this Verbatim formula for years. Burned thousands of them (literally), with fewer than a dozen rejects out of all those efforts. Discs I made several years ago and played many times show no sign of wear or deterioration. I can recall when a spool of 100 SONY or Memorex had more than 20 rejects every time. Has a decent coating that doesn't scratch as easily as others. Strongly recommended, and still the preferred brand on two high-tech video forums. Stock up now before the video industry succeeds in preventing video fans from making their own recordings."
4717,"I've only used 10 or so of these, but I was able to burn 16x (I think it achieved almost advertised speeds, if I remember correctly), and all 10 disks played great in my DVD player without skipping. Plus, a good price for 50 dvd-r's."
4718,I love Verbatim.  I use them all the time.  There is never a bad one.  I can's say that about other manufacturers.
4719,"I put these on my garage to listen to while working in the garden and cooking on the BBQ.  They sound really good considering the hunk of junk I pulled from the garbage to power it.PROS:Easy to install.  Good sound.  They work well after getting wet.  You can change the directions the speakers point easily.  They connect easy.  They are loud with no distortion.  Cheap (Under $40)!!!!CONS:Those screws embedded into the packaging are hard to find but after reading another review I was able to locate them.I highly recommend for summer use.  No idea how they will do in the winter, but I will not BBQ when it is below freezing."
4720,"this is a perfect CB if your looking for a radio with PA capabilities  that is compact. most radios this size dont offer the PA capability. one consideration is that this unit does not have a scan feature. i have the ext speaker (the one for listening to the other person talk) wired to the smaller factory speaker mounted in the door of my 08 Tacoma, volume is plenty loud. my friend has an 19dx iv also and he is using the unit's integrated speaker which isnt quite loud enough when driving down the road, forcing him to turn it up to a level where the output distorts slightly. an external speaker of some sort is definitely recommended with this (and almost all) CB units.bottom line if you are looking for something cheap to throw in your 4x4 for off roading or whatever the purpose, it has the exact same ""broadcast"" power as units costing 3x as much; of course you give up features like weather band, blue tooth connectivity,  back-lit knobs etc. but its small, cheap and works well at what its designed to do."
4721,"I purchased this MP3 for my deployment in Iraq. It has survived all the abuse (ie: climate, sandstorm, and accidentally dropping it). Transferring music files is a snap. The sound quality is good. It even has a sleep feature (up to 2 hours). The in-ear headphones help filter out some of the noise so you can hear the music better. I especially love the memory extension feature. Overall this MP3 completed all of my basic needs. Just one note. The case was ample but sucks when it's hooked on the armband. It keeps on falling off so I modified it with the velcro sticker. I suggest that you do the same thing or purchase a better case for it."
4722,"I can't find one negative thing to say about this little beauty. Small enough to clear up your desktop; perfect touchpad settings; awesome keystroke response/action.At $80.00 w/free shipping, it's a great value. Highly recommended!N.R."
4723,It didn't do what I wanted like I planed it but that's my desktop fault it doesn't support dual monitors but I we kept it and fould another use for it.
4724,"I bought these for using high capacity AA rechargable batteries in an Acoustics Research AW822 wireless outdoor speaker, which used 8 C cell batteries.  High capacity rechargable C cells are very expensive, and many of the standard capcity rechargable C cells are just high capacity AA's in a C cell body.Many people have fit issues with these adapters, so I wasn't sure if they were going to work, but they fit perfectly in this speaker."
4725,"I've got two of these now, one was purchased from bestbuy(don't buy from them they ripped me off as I payed about $20 more there...) I've only been able to compare it to a 1gb microdrive card that died on me, but these are super fast, reliable, and fair priced for what you get.There's a newer version of this card out, the extreme iv, but it seems the price for that is over $100 so you might as well stick with these for now.  Those ones are 15mb/s faster which is a noticeable amount but I've been perfectly fine w/30 mb/s and I do shoot sports and other action.As for going for the biggest card out there like a 8 mb or 16 mb...I'd rather not unless my camera has video because that takes up a ton of space.  I like my ability to have one card in the card reader and one in my camera.  Plus I reformat my card fairly often anyway so my card isn't likely to be that full."
4726,This was pretty easy to install and feels very solid.  I am completely comfortable having a large plasma display hang from up high on a wall given the sturdy construction of this mount and the installation guidelines presented.
4727,"Very sturdy and easy to solder. Also, the clamp mechanism is very strong which is important when keeping the cord attached through stress. And it's gold plated so this is a no brainer when your cord or plug is done for."
4728,"I bought this to protect my new DSC-W80. The case has a durable outside and a soft inside. The camera fit's securely itside. It has a small zippered compartment to hold extra memory or a battery. It has a closed belt loop, which can be un-snapped at one end to give some flexability in attaching the bag. I got it for under $10 from Company A, half the price of local retailers!"
4729,This is the best camera strap I've ever owned!  I put it on and it felt great.  Its made of some type of foam material with a bunch of little round dimbles in the middle section and an elastic strap running atop the foam.  Time will tell how the foam material stands up - but it seems as if it'll last and it is comfortable.
4730,"Nowhere else have I found a deal on blank DVDs as good as this.  My Gateway only burns two brands well-- Sony and Maxell. I burn DVDs regularly, and this was a SUPER buy for me, making burning more affordable."
4731,A superb product that simplifies the use of the modern home theater! Once programmed it can be used by the most technically challenged amongst us!
4732,"I bought this after it was marked down to $99.00.  For the price, this remote is a great deal.  It does a great job controlling our main entertainment center (Samsung LCD, Samsung upscaling DVD player, older JVC stereo, Tivo HD with Cable Card.)The remote is shaped like (and works very similar) to a Tivo remote, which helped my wife gradually give up the Tivo HD remote, something our older Harmony 550 couldn't do.  The recharging cradle is a nice touch, too.I would have loved to get the new Harmony One remote, but it was a little too expensive at the time I was looking for a new remote."
4733,"I bought this battery in 2010 to replace the battery in my APC UPS. A product like this is doing its best when you forget it's there. My battery is over two years old, and is still going."
4734,"I'd had my eye on the Samsung LN-R**8W series for quite some time after starting to see them in various places used as monitors for PCs and as televisions hooked up to XBox 360s. Every time I saw one of these sets (the demo models were invariably the 23"" version), I had to stop and stare. Usually the game playing was ""Call of Duty 2"", but it looked positively stunning. Finally I watched some high-def programming at a store on the 26"" model and I was sold. Having read not a single on-line review and without doing any research whatsoever, I was sold by my eyes alone. The only 'research' I did was comparing this set to other brands, and this was the clear winner.The 3000:1 contrast ratio is misleading. They used 'dynamic' contrast ratio to come up with that figure. I've since learned the actual contrast ratio as used by most other manufacturers is around 800:1, which is still among the best of the current crop. The next generation will undoubtedly beat this figure. But for my purposes, this set is just fantastic. The blacks are black, and all shades of gray seem to come through as intended. To judge this, I'm replaying ""Deus Ex"", a PC game from back in 2000 (which runs fine in WinXP and supports 1360 x 768). This game takes place entirely at night, so there are a lot of dark areas along with many shades of gray. This game looks amazing, as does FarCry (2004) with its beautiful vivid tropical colors and water. Those are the only two games I've tried thus far. And I imagine games that natively support 1360 x 768 will naturally fare better on this set. For instance, a game that only supports 1024 x 768 will probably look kinda crappy because of scaling problems, a problem all LCD monitors share when not running in their native resolution.I'm using it primarily as a huge monitor for my PC. I had to think hard about this, because using this set as a PC monitor, your screen resolution will max out at 1360 x 768, which is great for television, but hardly cutting-edge for a computer monitor. However, to find a PC monitor this BIG with ultra-high resolution would have set me back about double the dollars. And since my rig (An Athlon 2600+ with an NVidia 6600GT video card) isn't capable of playing games at ultra-high res anyway, I'm happy with this. Also, I've since learned that this series of sets is the easiest to configure for computer use. It's got a VGA port on the back, so just buy a VGA cable, hook it to your PC, and it's Plug-And-Play. Just remember before unhooking your old monitor to resize the screen in Windows to 1360 x 768 so it boots to the correct size after you hook this up.Picture quality is excellent. The best I've ever seen in an LCD. They're all pretty decent these days, but this one stands out as brighter, sharper, crisper, clearer, at least to my eyes. Before buying anything this expensive though, I'd make sure you actually see various brands in action at various stores before you buy.I don't have high-def service at home yet, so the only HD I've viewed on this has been at the store, but it looked awesome to me.Picture-in-picture is really only useful if you're surfing the net and want to watch TV at the same time. For that, it's great, though you'll have to manually use the remote to activate sound in PIP each time. An annoyance. The speakers sound clear and crisp. Not huge, but nice-sounding.And now, the only flaw I've found: Out of the box, the reds can be oversaturated when contrasted with black. I've only noticed this with text; graphics are fine. I might be able to adjust this in the set's menu, but haven't tried it yet, because otherwise it looks just absolutely perfect and I hate to mess with it."
4735,"Like a lot of people looking for top quality gear for their Nikon SLR body, I considered the Nikkor lenses and was willing to pay the higher prices but thought I'd read a few reviews of the aftermarket brands before I decided. Of the several brands, TOKINA stood out from the rest in the reviews with respect to image quality, construction quality, and ease of use. I had originally thought of the 11-16mm f/2.8 Tokina which had garnered excellent reviews but it didn't have quite the zoom range I wanted: 17-36mm in the 35mm format. I was looking for a wide zoom I could use as my walkabout lens for street, architectural, and indoor photography.Then I found this, the Tokina 12-24mm f/4 zoom. Read the reviews online, watched some reviews on YouTube, and decided this was the one. Let me tell you that the vendor, Adorama in New York, took my order late in the afternoon, shipped that evening, and I had the lens before 3:00PM the following day near Boston. Wow! Didn't even select anything but the standard, no shipping charges, rate. Fantastic service from Adorama - it came in a fair sized box, well packed, and worked perfectly right away.So far, I have not been out with it but have just done brief tests in my backyard and indoors. Outside, shooting with autofocus on my new Nikon D7000, the focus was rapid and right on target. The manual focus was sharp as well. The slide back for manual and slide forward for autofocus works well. I like it better than trying to find the slide switch on my nikkor zooms to switch to manual.The lens is solid, heavy, pro quality with a substantial hood to reduce glare, always a problem with wide angle lenses. As you may know, Nikon is using a fair amount of plastic in their prosumer lens line. The mount is still metal in any but the cheapest lenses in the Nikon selection, but other potentially breakable parts are not. If you still want to pay thousands for a Nikkor lens you will get quality. Enter Tokina. I don't like to go outside the Nikon stable for gear, but Tokina merits serious consideration.When I took a look at my brief, unpackaging, test results I was very happy to see, blowing up the shots of tree limbs against a blue sky, that the corners were sharp, the colors were excellent, the contrast was good, and that this was obviously a lens I was going be happy to use this coming season. I'll update this as I use the lens in the near future. Recommended.First additional comment: using the provided lens hood I noticed fringing in the corners at the 12mm extreme wide angle setting. Taking more test shots at the same focal length without the lens hood, I found that the fringing disappeared. So, if you notice fringing, don't blame the lens itself. And on my second series of test shots out in my backyard I noticed slight blue fringing of branches against a light sky in the extreme upper right. But no camera lens that any amateur could afford is without a trace of it in extreme exposure situations. Still think highly of this lens.However, there is one fly in the ointment: Company A may not tell you on this page, but there is a newer version of this lens, the Pro DX II, which has internal autofocus like Nikon's silentwave. The new version of this lens (from 2010 summer I believe) also has what is described as an advanced lens coating. Neither is worth another US$100 to me. I have a Nikon D7000 which has a focus motor built-in to use with lenses like this one and don't need the lens to do the focusing as a camera like the D40 needs.Postscript: I've done more photography outdoors, in cityscapes, and I'm very satisfied with this lens! Sharp corner to corner in my usage. Sharp enough that a black and white image looks REALLY sharp even when viewed on a 22"" monitor. Plenty of sharpness and contrast and true colour to work with. Great addition to any Nikon photogs bag."
4736,"Yes, we had stereos in the 1970s. That was before overpriced monster cable was invented.This is good heavy gauge wire. Not oxygen-free but cheap. Hey, this is going in our family room; we're not wiring the space shuttle here.Make sure you order enough. We needed 2 rolls to setup our 7.1 system."
4737,I would not want to type a letter on this keyboard as the keys take a firm keystroke to register.  But I use this on stage for midi sequencing and it works perfect as it is water proof and lights up.
4738,"This product is pure anathema to the DIY photography craze.  These clamps are luxurious by any measure, built like a Company J tank, and carry a premium price tag.  Though there are various alternatives such sold under the Flashpoint and Cowboy Studio brand, that are decent by any measure, they come nowhere close in terms of quality (I owned them).  I would consider at least one of these clamps a necessary tool in the bag of any strobist.The unit easily handles my SB700's or SB900's.  The clamp mechanism is very strong with a design that is adaptable to irregular surfaces as well as light stand or top of a door. The clamp has quality rubber tacks to prevent scratching surfaces. The quality ball head provides the ability to position the flash in any manner. My only caveat, which for some might be a plus, is that the flash cold shoe is plastic.  Obviously, plastic would prevent a short in the flash unit (problem when the first SB900's hit the market). However, I remain concerned about long term durability.  I admit- a very minor concern given the pure quality of the unit.The Manfrotto Clamp also accepts the Manrotto (or other brand) flexible arm (3/8 attachment). On location, this is a powerful combination allowing you to improvise, adapt, and overcome the many variables on location.Get at least one of these clamps and you will never doubt the return of investment. But, to be honest, the cheaper versions from other brands may be just as useful."
4739,"At the highest quality setting with a 10 mega pixel camera I get 132 photos. If that isn't enough for you then you just don't know what you're doing--you're using the camera as your photo scrap book or something.Company A price beat ""Best Buy"" by about a mile."
4740,"Works in conjunction with PCT International 3038 Connect3D Radeon X800 GTO Graphics Card. The two units allow me to pick up approximately 50 channels from the DC/Balt area. I am about 15 miles north of DC, I have it installed in my attic and there is a large oak in the line of sight."
4741,"This tweeters are amazing.  They are way very loud for their small size, plus they don't loose their fidelity."
4742,"Growing up in the 70s and 80s as a photo enthusiast I had a succession of Nikon SLRs and lenses and was deeply devoted to them.  In the late 90s and early 2000s I was seduced by the ability to manipulate and quickly print digital pictures and had a succession of digital cameras including an Olympus D490z and a Canon G3.  These cameras had their charms, but they were slow to shoot - often missing the action.  Their dynamic range (ability to capture detail in both shadow and highlight areas) paled beside good film.  Also, their lightweight manual override modes and lenses made them poor competition to the Nikons for nighttime, macro, and special lighting photography.  I purchased a Nikon D50 almost as an impulse when I saw the price - and was prepared to be disappointed.  For the most part I was thrilled.What's hot:1) This camera is FAST.  Just like my film SLR, the camera is instantly on when I turn it on and shoots as fast as my finger drops (except when the flash is involved - just like my SLR).  I finally get action shots of the kids!  Yipeee!  This feature alone totally sold my wife on this camera.2) Autofocus is awesome - seems to have ESP when picking subjects.  Has quick and easy target selection override.3) Great dynamic range and resolution.  Shooting in fine jpeg mode allows me to print in whatever size I like - up to 8x10 without obvious artifacts.  Tones are smooth without visible plateaus most of the time and have good detail in both shadow and bright areas.4) Great flexibility.  A wealth of modes gives me shortcuts to operational modes that handle a wealth of special sitation photography.  Manual overrides give me amazing control.5) Good (but not perfect) meter.6) Small and extremely light weight for an SLR.7) 18-55mm lens has good wide angle range, somewhat limited telephoto - but covers all the basics with aplomb.  I seldom want for more.8) Great macro mode in the built-in camera.  Nikon has purpose-built macro lenses, but the macro in the standard 18-55 is way better than the G3's $85 macro add-on solution.  Images of coins fill the frame and you can see tiny detail.  Way more than adequate for selling coins or stamps on Ebay.9) I find this camera very attractive10) Integrated help screens in many of the menus.  This camera is deep.  You will not get the most out of it unless you take the time to learn about it.  Once you have the gist - the help screens help you remember what's up when you're out in the field.NOTs1) I can't use my old Nikon AI lenses.  They fit - but don't communicate with the meter.2) Superlightweight for the size - will it be durable?3) It may be lightweight for the size - but this is still an SLR and can't compete with smaller cameras for portability.  This doesn't fit in any pockets - it hangs around your neck or lives in a kit bag.4) Doesn't have a ""B"" mode on shutter release - limiting its use for astrophotography.  This is too bad because it's so light.5) 18-55mm lens isn't as cool as the 18-70mm lens the D70S ships with.  Oh well - the 18-55 is still mighty fine for the price.  If you have more scratch buy the D50 body and get the 18-70 ala cart.6) This a serious camera for photo enthusiasts.  While the awesome speed and image quality in full auto mode makes it easy for beginners to get started, a point and shoot user is going to to frustrated by this camera because the magic requires a half hour with the manual and some basic photo knowledge.7) 2"" screen on the back is fixed - it's more for settings and looking at pictures after you shoot than for shooting.  You shoot while looking through the viewfinder on this camera.  This fits the whole SLR ethos.  I sometimes miss the cool articulated screen with the G3 that let me hold the camera at arm's length - like low to the ground or high in the air to get cool ""point of view"" shots.  That's right out with the D50.8) Secure Digital Media - a strength or weakness depending on your perspective.  Most other DSLRs use compact flash and I'm selling my nice collection of compact flash cards on Ebay right now.Bottom line?  After 25 years I'm finally selling my Nikon FA (and all my darkroom equipment).  The D50 is so good that I'm putting film to bed at last.  The shooting experience with the D50 is as good as film in most areas and better in some others.  The fact that you can bring this home for under eight bills is gravy.  This price, by the way is pretty much exactly what the film SLRs ended up costing in adjusted dollars.  Kudos to Nikon for leapfrogging Canon with the killer entry level DSLR.  Last point - this might BE the entry level DSLR - but nothing FEELs entry level about it.  This is a real serious - GOOD - tool for photography.  It's a revolutionary product from my perspective."
4743,I did some research before buying the Camera and I was surprised to find that in many instances the S2 was preferred over its replacement the S3. I had to throw away the Nikon Coolpix I had previously. It took terrible pictures . I'am very impressed with the features and quality of the S2. You have to read the manual but it is very simple to operate considering all the features. Canon has a great reputation for fine quality so I'am looking forward to years of good pictures.
4744,"Promply delivered, this pack of four rechargeable batteriesand compact charger seems ideal for digital camera use.The price for both batteries and charger seems extremelyreasonable.  I would recommend this without reservations."
4745,"These Powerex AA rechargeables are the best I've tried.I've tried several different brands of NiMH AA batteries (Delkin @ 2900 mAH, Power2000 @ 2500 mAH, La Crosse @ 2600 mAH, Duracell @ 2650 mAH, and DigiCam @ 1800 mAH).  I use the La Crosse BC-900U charger on all of them so that I can see to what capacity they can be charged to, and even the La Crosse batteries that came with it can't be charged up to their own stated capacity.  Duracell and Delkin both had a dud in each 4-pack of AA batteries.  For all five manufacturers, the fully charged capacities of their AA batteries never exceeded about 80% of their stated capacities.  None ever came close to a ""full charge'.  There was always at least one in each pack (excluding the dud in each pack) that would only charge up to about 50-60% of capacity, which would lead to a premature ""Low Battery' shutdown of my camera.The Powerex  on the other hand, all charged to 95%+ of their rated 2700 mAH capacities and really last!."
4746,"I purchased these for use in my Sony Camcorder, as I prefer to use products sugggested by the manufacturer. I normally copy all my videos to a DVD and erase these tapes with a bulk eraser. I have used the same tape several times with no loss of video quality."
4747,The lens was delivered int he time in which the sender said it would. It was packed very well. I ripped it open and started taking photos as soon as I got it. Its your standard starter kit lens but I didn't have one so I am excited. Great product.
4748,"Admittedly, I'm a fan of Altec Lansing products anyway, but this little unit was a terrific purchase for my daughter's iPod.  Lightweight, simple but nicely manufactured design with good sound quality.  Not a big booming sound capability, but this unit not marketed that way.  Very good small/medium room sound, but lacks the power for capable outdoor use. I like the AC and battery power options.  Came with a small IR remote, which works okay, but nothing spectacular. Easy to fold up and transport. Battery life is good, but not great.  Liked the sound & quality of this iPod speaker well enough that I bought another Altec Lansing iPod speaker for my wife's iPod Mini. Very satisfied with both devices."
4749,The Belkin USB 2.0 hub was very easy to setup.  The top mounted jacks allow very easy access for memory sticks or camera connections.
4750,"This is great if you are looking for multiple sockets w/out a USB. I bought one of these a year ago and just got another, they are great. The only downside it the wings to screw it in place are not that durable but combine using them with the sticky pad or some glue and you are set. Overall 5 stars for the price"
4751,"Looked for this adaptor at a lot of stores and didn't find it, checked on line for it and bam...there is was and now I am back on line"
4752,"Love the accessories for securing the cable in place. Not one bad port, even though I had to re-punch a few."
4753,I bought one to use on a new computer in our office.  It wors perfectly.  I was using a netgeat 1111 whatever on another computer and it was corrupting the Windows log-in software - so I purchased a second one to replace the netgear device and it works perfectly as well.  No complaints - good price - I would buy another.
4754,"I was a little concerned as I searched for a mount that I could use with my Olevia 32 inch flat panel (232V).  I was not worried about the TV itself but the center of the studs on the wall where I planned to install it were 25.5 inches apart - and none of the reviews or doucmentation talked about that being a workable setup.I decided to go ahead and order it and see if it would work out and I am glad I did.  First it allowed me the flexibility to install it in between those studs and there was probably room to go a couple of inches further as well.  Second, it was very easy to install.If you can do a few handyman things around the house then you can easily install this.  I do suggest you follow my wifes advice that she gave me as I got started ""Do not drill holes in my wall until you are absolutely sure you know where they are going!"".Overall a terrific mount and I highly recommend it."
4755,"Recently decided to upgrade our network switches to run fiber interconnects. It has greatly increased the speed of our Internal network. (File shares, etc.) In our cisco switches, it was really just plug and play. Please note that on some managed switches there is an ethernet port that coincides with the fiber port. If you have both plugged in, it will fall to the ethernet and cause all sorts of issues (which was my case)."
4756,"This fan mounted correctly as the holes lined up.  When power was applied, it moved air.  Makes little noise.  I installed two in the computer case. I recommend it highly."
4757,"We didn't want to pay $10/mo that the cable company wanted for model rental, so we bought our own. Our connection is fast and strong. Very affordable and arrived fast! Would recommend 100%"
4758,"This is my third Hoya filter, and I can say now that I've officially been converted from Tiffen filters. I previous had Tiffen filters on all of my lenses, and I even just gave one of my Tiffen filters away after discovering how much better the Hoya filters are (especially for wide angle lenses). I will now be slowly swapping many of my tiffen filters for hoyas, and there are a couple of reasons why.First, these filters have a really nice coating. They're not the best out there, but for the price, they're phenomenal. I've noticed that there is a HUGE difference on all of my wide angle lenses; the coating really does reduce lens flare quite a bit. I've compared my tiffen filters head to head with the hoya ones, and any time there's a shot where there's a nearby light source, the other filters produce unusable photos, while the hoya performs marvelously and keeps those ugly spots from showing up.Its true that multi-coated filters require more care when cleaning (to prevent scratching), but I've a few of these hoya filters for a few months of pretty heavy use, and I don't always have the chance to use proper cleaning technique, but these have held up really well; Mine all arrived in pristine clean condition, and haven't developed scratches. I also like that these filters have a pretty thin rim, which means I can use them with my widest dx lens without worrying about vignetting."
4759,"I have used Nikon caps and others.  The Nikon caps have been the most reliable and are easy to take on an off.  I have never had one fall off and they always seem to set perfectly in the lens or filter ends.  They are pricier than I think they should be, but have always performed better than cheaper ones."
4760,"This replaces a Sony TCWE475 that wiped out after I tried to extract a jammed tape (no complaints after 10 years of service).  I was inclined to get another Sony deck (currently the #1 seller on Company A), but I'm hopeful the Onkyo may be more capable of handling a snarled tape without self-destructing before my eyes.  Also, it's a nice complement--mechanically and visually--to my Onkyo Stereo Amp (TX-8222).Cassettes are largely dead technology, so some of the features unique to either machine will not be as relevant as once was the case.  The Onkyo boasts hi-speed dubbing; the Sony does not.  The Sony gladdens a musician's heart with a Pitch Control knob; Onkyo apparently assumes not enough music fans have good enough pitch for such a control to matter.  The Sony also comes with an automatic search feature that's not only quite effective but can come in handy for locating ""tracks"" whether for playing or dubbing; the Onkyo omits this feature.  Aesthetically, the Sony's full-sized volume knob (for adjusting auto record) is more satisfying than the shrunken, diminutive knob Onkyo assigns to this function.  Otherwise, I give Onkyo points for making their cassette deck more immediately readable and accessible than their receiver, with its many same-sized black buttons that are flush to the receiver's face. The instruction manualsare both complete (but not overwhelming) and clearly written (give Sony a slight edge for especially complete, user-friendly instructions and diagrams.  The Sony is slightly lighter and more compact, and sentiment and past experience would lead me to recommend it over the Onkyo, especially when the price appears to be slightly under the Onkyo's.  But the ""what have you done for me lately"" phenomenon has left a bad taste, leading me to recommend the Onkyo, if for only a single reason.Both the Sony and Onkyo manuals warn against the use of 2-hour cassette tapes (they're thin and highly breakable).  Nevertheless, when I'm recording a 2-hour show away from home, that's what I felt compelled to use.  The result: one of them jammed in my Sony.  When that happens, you're s--d, because there's no way to open the door to get at and remove the defective tape.  Neither Sony nor Onkyo has answer for this predicament in their troubleshooting section of the manuals.  So my hope, possibly prayer, is that the ""apparently"" heavy-duty Onkyo will handle defective tapes better than my Sony did.  (Face it, nowadays equipment that costs a hundred or two is cheaper to replace than to send out for repair.)A couple of closing recommendations.  Don't buy a used cassette deck or turntable unless it's screamingly cheap and/or you've had a chance to check it out thoroughly.  (Loudspeakers and amplifiers are an altogether different proposition.)  Also, ignore manufacturers' claims that some of the other tape decks (and turntables) are ""specifically designed"" for analog to digital conversion. Additionally, be wary of overusing Dolby B and especially Dolby C.  With today's compressed recordings, your results will most likely sound more full-frequencied (i.e. no muted treble) without NR.  And last, if your computer lacks a simple 1/8"" audio input, you can pick up a USB adapter for several dollars.  And in most cases (since Sony and Onkyo, for example, don't try to snag innocent consumers with bogus claims about digital conversion), you'll have a better-sounding result because it's been played back on more reliable, proven audiophile equipment).  Consumers apparently soon catch on, which is why the ""conversion"" components with unfamiliar names rarely receive rave reviews on Company A."
4761,"Good cheap power supply provides plenty of voltage and current to power a computer that is full of drives.  It is noisier than more expensive power supplies, not sure about how long it will last as cheap PS seem to die quicker."
4762,I have used these on several occasions to record some movies. They aren't that expensive and play back the movies in real good quality.
4763,I love this brand and never have any problems with it.I'm about to buy another 50PK.
4764,"I am a Logitech fan anyway. They are the best built and smoothest mice I have used. An MS mouse is crude compared to Logitech mice. Swiss Company J I guess. I have an MX500 for my desktop and now this V200. This is by far my best and most favorite mouse. Loads of features and very adjustable. Smooth as butter in use. Only complaint is the weight because it uses two AA batteries and is quite heavy. Logitech should build in a leight rechargeable battery. I would be glad to pay the premium for that.For those interested ... the materials, design and looks are also super cool!"
4765,"If you are thinking on having this state of the art unit, DON'T:  JUST BUY IT!!!I got one today, overnight delivery. It was not on Company A.com, and I still don't know how this other serious company got it, but it did arrive.It's so NEAT, so detailed, so usefull. I feel stupid having invested on my PSP just to play movies.That piece of machine is fantastic. Big screen (almost the size of the unit itself.. it was about time);Say goodbye to your Ipods, unless they invest MUCH MUCH better on movies.Say goodbye to everytghing that this unit can replace. It's 100 Gigabytes, it can work as a hard drive. The best is to record from tv, video, dvd, satelite, etc.; Than you can watch on very flexible formats (almost flexible) on the big screen (well, HUGE for a portable device); And  you can just link a simple cable and watch in dvd quality on any tv.It's changing my life. I will have free weekends, being able to travel outside my home and still watch and not cumulate all my recorded series. I LOVE THIS UNIT AND I THANK ARCHOS for his fantastic well treatment on details on this one. It's also very beautifull.No, I don't work to Archos and I plays full price for having it before anybody else (well, not too much, about 40 dollars more than in Company A, my preferred provider of gadgets.Sami Paskin[...]"
4766,"These are really nice blank DVD's. I like the Light Scribe, so I can make my DVD's much more fancy than writing on them. I love the Light Scribe burner, and these DVDs work well with it. Nice quality."
4767,"I have used usb devices since they barely worked in windows 98 - and i would say a usb hub is a terrific device.  this hub is no exception, as it replaced another 7 port i had, that wouldnt take more than 4 devices. I have had no issues, although i will be putting black tape over the FLASHING lights in the center of the unit - thats my only issue - other than that, i bought a second, as the first i have had for 3 months, and am quite happy with it, except for the flashing."
4768,"a year later and it has been working just great!  you hear about installing memory in  pairs?  if it is recommended for your computer, then be sure that you do install in pairs in order to take advantage of the dual channel capability.  it certainly speeds things up.  remember, your memory will only run as fast as your slowest stick of memory."
4769,"This product worked fine on my computer, it was instantly recognized by my old hp computer.It did make it faster on loading programs and launching. overall a good product"
4770,"The amount of the glue is sufficiently enough for CPU, after I used once, there was almost half in it still!"
4771,"I actually bought these cables not be be used as a component video but to actually replace it into a Digital Coaxial Cable and a sub-woofer cable. I still have one more to spare. It has the specs of a Digital Coaxial Cable (75ohm) and it has a firm grip contact on the connection. They are very well built, but even if you use it as component, it will transmit a very good almost flawless video signal. So therefore because of the price, the quality  and the many uses it can perform it is in my opinion a 5 star product. The cables has a rubber bridge attaching the three cables together, hence if you are going to split the cables into three single cables you need to be very careful not to cut the shielding coating."
4772,I like having these grey cards in my camera bag. I find them handy to take along especially in low light situations!
4773,I record both Laser Discs and VHS Cassettes (titles not available on DVD) to get my video collection to a better video format.  These are the only blank discs I have found that are reliable.  Many other brands will not record properly in my recorder.  Over many years I have had better results with TDK products than any other brand.
4774,"I have probably purchased and burned some 1,000 of these.  I have been using these for at least 8 years.  However, the last two spindles I bought ended up having some bad discs.  I knew it had to be the disc material and not the writing equipment nor the software.  So, although these have served me very well over the years, they have become difficult to get.  I now use Verbatim but will surely use these again if I cannot find Verbatim."
4775,"Well constructed. Easy to use. CDs and booklets fit fairly easily. Fat booklets can be a slight struggle, but work well overall. Easy to get to everything once loaded up. Solved a space and access problem for me."
4776,"I don't know about all the cheap vs expensive cable, digital error, and corrosion stuff. But I do know that I only paid $20 and it works well. I'm satisfied with what I got for the money."
4777,"I purchased this cable to connect the Sony upscaling DVD player to a Samsung HDTV. It works perfect, no problems. The picture is wonderful and the thinking behind buying a more expensive cable is lost on me."
4778,"This is my first Radar Detector and I am very happy with it. The mounting suction cups work better then I expected. I picked this one after reading the reviews on Company A.I bought this threw Company A not a second party so there is no problem with warranty.This Detector saved me in at least 3 instances on one road trip to Lake Tahoe. My advice to someone that is not familiar with radar detecting is, If you are being picked up by a chp coming at you slow down don't waste time. It didn't come with the smart cord that Company A claimed it did. I really don't have a problem with the cord it came with so it doesn't bother me. I also advise disconnecting the power cord when not in use and plug it in after your car is started. My Mercedes did some weird things when I started it and the radar detector was plugged into power. Get this without reservation you won't be sorry...Happy Trails"
4779,"I bought this cable to connect my MacBook Pro to my LG 52LG70 television. I plugged the DVI end into the Mac and the HDMI end into the TV and it just worked. I had to make one easy tweak on the TV end to get the aspect ratio right, but the Mac recognized that it was now talking to an LG TV (yes, even the brand) and correctly read the resolution as 1920 x 1080. The image is clear and bright. The cable is doing its job simply and brilliantly.My only complaint with this cable has to do with my own planning. I thought five meters sounded like plenty of length, but it isn't--not in my family room. I should have measured rather than assuming. But that's my fault, not the cable's, so no star deduction."
4780,The only thing I'm not satisfied is that the length of of the speaker wire is too short.
4781,"This works great, I used while on vacation and it always recharged within minutes.  I could also listen to my Ipod while having it plugged in, it was really cool."
4782,"This thing is awesome, the best sounding box I've ever heard. One of the buttons is hard to push, but it sounds so good that I couldn't care less.  I use the remote anyway, so no biggie.  It probably sounds better than a lot of home stereos.  I use it for my iPhone, iPod Nano, MacBook Pro, and an old mp3 player as well.  It has as Aux-in and it came with a cable that will fit those mini headphone jacks for an iPhone and many other mp3 players.I don't think they make this any longer, but I am listening to it now, and it just makes me smile; such a rich full sound. Altec Lansing made a winner here!  Today I ordered a couple other Altec Lansing speaker products that had good reviews and I expect them to be winners too.  Thanks Altec Lansing, keep up the good work!"
4783,"I must've bought at least five of them over the years.  Not that they don't last - they've gone with systems I've either sold or gifted to people.  This has a short, laptop-style keystroke, which gives much more positive feedback than the current Apple keyboards.  For me, that means fast, accurate typing.  The control/option/cmd keys are in the right place, Hooray!  Price of entry is way below the current Apple keyboard, and this is orders of magnitude better than the old white Apple Pro keyboards or any of the awful USB keyboards that came before it.Beware that it does have a rather large footprint, although the design is attractive and doesn't look out of place with the other Apple junk on my desk."
4784,"I mounted under existing Analog antenna and it gets in most channels crystal Clear. Some extra channels come in as well. I live approx. 30 miles from baltimore and washington, near frederick Maryland. I am now considering an antenna rotator to go with it. I will probably get many more channels then.Great product. Not sure what weather will do to it though."
4785,"I love these speakers.  The box makes them easy to travel with and there is room to store a USB extender cable, which I suggest buying.  That way, you can set the speakers farther away from the computer and out of the way of your coffee cup or whatever.It took me a while to remember to use the controls for volume on the speakers themselves, but when I remembered (!) it was very convenient.I'm not an audiophile, but the speakers are very functional and my audiophile husband says they are ""OK, for what they are.""  Oh, and he bought a set, too!The fact that I can just plug them into the USB port of my laptop means I can still set up my computer on the hotel room desk without looking for additional outlets; this is great because the outlets in rooms are always in the most inconvenient places!!!I would buy these again."
4786,"this is really an awesome product, it works perfect, not only cools my Midnight Company B 1505 but it also doesnt make any sound. what it would really is missing is more usb ports. i totally recommend it !"
4787,Sleeves are sleeves...
4788,"I don't know about you, but I have enough USB sticks in my life to drive me crazy.  I tend to back up my image galleries to USB.  It's fairly portable... that is, until the industry changes the media default to something else.  So for the time being, this is where I'm keeping my &#34;stuff!&#34;  And it's pretty neat, easy to organize, and with a bit of creativity, you could also leave notes, aka, table of contents with each stick."
4789,"This clips easily to my key ring to carry two things: one one side, I store my Fitbit One.  On the other side, I store a contact lens plunger (a DMV brand: I use them to take out my contact lenses, which are gas permeable hard lenses, not soft lenses, and many people need to use a little rubber plunger stick with a suction cup to take them out).  This clips onto my key ring, which I always have with me.  The Fitbit fits easily, and the inside has a clear plastic piece so you can see the Fitbit and push the button and view the info without having the remove it from the sheath.I always like to have a contact lens plunger, so if dust blows in my eyes I can take out the contact lens and rinse them off.  If you have just a plunger and no Fitbit, there are better (smaller) alternatives at Company A (such as a pill holder which is what I used before I got the Fitbit).  I chose the Fitbit One because I don't want to wear some silly plastic wrist bracelet.  I'm a no jewelry guy (wedding ring and watch are all I want to wear), and the other fitness bands didn't appeal to me.  I bought this with my Fitbit so I wouldn't have to have a silly bracelet, and this helps do the job perfectly.  The only minor annoyance is that when I drive, this hangs from the keys and then my Fitbit registers a few steps here and there, but not a big deal.In conclusion: if you hate plastic bracelets but want a fitness tracker, this works great for the Fitbit one.  Also holds something else small, such as a plunger, but could also hold a small Swiss army knife (like the really thin mini sized ones) or anything else that you might lose if it were just loose in your pocket."
4790,"I already had the Caselogic 2 capacity USB case, and I just kept getting more and more.  So, I purchased this 6 capacity one and it is much nicer.  Instead of a velcro closure, it has a zipper, which makes it much more secure.  It is well made and, is small enough to tote around anywhere.  Highly reccomended. 5 stars across the board!!!"
4791,"Like others I was sent to this product by an Apple store employee.  I was a bit skeptical of how well it would work until I tried it myself.It works, and works well.  Dunno what they put in that solution but it really took off the fingerprints, grime, and sticky drops that accumulate over time on your devices.  Did not leave streak marks behind.I used it on the screens on my iPad, iPod touch, and Macbook, as well as the cases.Odd thing on the micro-cloths: one side is more fine and the other side a bit less so.  They tell you to use the less-fine side for cleaning and the more-fine side for polishing and removing the cleaning solution.  I've never seen a cloth quite like that before, but it works great for this application.I was also surprised to read in the enclosed instructions that you can use it on cell phone screens and camera lenses.  It is safe for all of those applications and won't damage the fine lens optics or the plastics in the phones or cases.  Sure enough, I tried it on those things too and again it worked very well.So this has quickly become my general purpose cleaner / polisher.Just make sure that you spray the cleaner directly onto the cloths, and never directly onto the screens or lenses, to avoid excess liquid getting past the seals and into the electronics or devices themselves.I'll be buying this again, however next time probably just the cleaner solution.  The larger sized cloths are almost the size of hand towels, and are washable, so they're going to last a very long time.  Just need to get more cleaner when I run out."
4792,"This is the only cleaner I have found that works well on the older non-glass mac LCD cinema displays.The other cleaners I tried left smear marks that were almost as bad as the original spots. If you read the directions on its use and are diligent about buffing it dry, your screen will look close to new.It may be a little pricey, but it is the best cleaner I have found. And unless you are spitting all over your monitor daily, one bottle is going to last quite some time."
4793,"It cleans my electronics really nicely. I only tried it for my Apple products so far. maybe next time I should clean my TV with it. I like how it comes with large and small microfiber cloth. I usually use the big cloth for when it's still when from the spray, and use the small cloth to get rid of the lines from the big cloth. Result: squeaky clean screen. Awesome."
4794,"I use the Verbatim DVD-R's to back up my AVI files, computer data of all kinds and any other types of backup I might need.  I have gone thru 5 packages so far and have NEVER had a bad discs or any write errors. I now skip the 'verify data' step as they always work for me. I use an El Cheapo Compaq running Windows 7 with a basic DVD RW drive.  Nary a glitch and discs can be read in all my different media players so far.  I wouldn't even bother with any other brand. These cost a bit more, but it is worth it in the lack of frustration."
4795,I record with RW disks to record over and over again.  Reusing CD's is what I always do with my disks.
4796,Was looking for a replacement for my aged Logitech media keyboard that decided to randomly repeat keystrokes. This Microsoft keyboard is surprisingly usable once you get used to the curved layout. There are the same programmable keys available as I was used to with the old Logitech. Great keyboard for the price.
4797,"I'm a software developer, so I type a LOT.  I use this keyboard at home and at work, and have bought roughly four or five of these over the years.  They hold up well for the price, but I put a lot of mileage on my keyboards - I don't expect to get much more than two to three years out of them.  At this price, I am very happy.More importantly, it's the best compromise on ergonomics for me.  The slightly curved key layout works great for me and relieves tension in my wrists."
4798,This battery pertrudes from the laptop but it's worth it because of the longer battery life
4799,Maxell is a great product. Have used their tapes and discs for years with the best of results. You can't go wrong with Maxell.
4800,"Whether you buy this as a toy or a tool, this is not a device that is going to spring out of its box ready to use.  I consider myself fairly experienced in electronics and radio-related stuff and it took me several obsessive evenings of tinkering with the settings, reading and re-reading the manual, and searching through a half dozen online forums and reference sites dedicated to just this scanner model to get things set up properly.Most folks who own this scanner are happy to share the files they have created of their own metropolitan areas (I found and downloaded complete Baltimore County files in a few minutes after subscribing BCD396T Yahoo Group) and with the included data cable every feature of the scanner can be controlled and modified from the computer screen.Now that the unit is completely set up, it works exactly the way I want it to.  This is a great portable scanner if you have digital trunking systems in your area, or anticipate your local systems going digital in the next few years.  The back-light works great and lights up the buttons along with the display, which makes the scanner as easy to use in the dark as in full daylight.The included antenna is a wide-band scanner antenna, so expect to have to purchase a band-specific antenna for the unit if you're mostly concerned with listening to 700 or 800 MHz trunking bands in your area and want the best possible performance on those bands.If you have no digital systems in your area, you may want to check out some of the less expensive alternatives without digital capability such as theUNIDEN BC-246T Compact Hand Held Scanner."
4801,"I love my ipod. Granted I have not used any other portable digital music player other than the ipod in order to do a comparison, but i don't know how I lived without the ipod before. A few years ago I had considered purchasing the 400 CD changer from Sony. I'm so glad I didn't do it. Now I have the ability to put all my CD collection in one little package, play it through my stereo system at home (its primary location) and take it with me in the car on long trips, eliminating the need for CD changers at home, and lugging the CD's in the car.  My wife loves it because she no longer has to keep switching CD's in the CD changer every few days.  I don't have any complaints about the unit. I have it on a Kensington dock which is connected to the stereo receiver at home and have a Kensington FM transmitter for the car. Both work great."
4802,"A superb Cokin product, as usual.  This product is not for beginners because it requires a more advanced understanding of what it is supposed to accomplish.  The filters do save time in the &#34;PC darkroom&#34; when processing digital photos, but they do not completely replace the use of HDR software."
4803,"This GPS unit was really remarkable. Before purchasing it, I was skeptical in general about the GPS technology, and its reliability. So to any first time buyer, here is my advice. Buy this GPS unit Garmin c340 without any hesitation.Here are the main advantages -It knows and will show you exactly where you are. If you miss any turn, your route will be re-calculated very quickly.The Points of Interest feature is awesome. For long trips, you no longer need to stop by any old reststop and eat Panda Express or Arbys. You can stop to a restaurant of your choice and taste. For example, we were able to locate several Friendly's restaurants on our route from NYC to Toronto. You have a choice of weather you wish to locate the nearest location, or at your destination, different city or even at your current route. This is very useful feature to choose where you want to locate the point of interest, when you are on a long trip.I almost agree with many reviewers that this GPS unit is worth its weight in Gold. If not Gold, atleast weight in Silver. (Perhaps nuvi 660 is probably be worth its weight in GOLD)The kind of things that bothered me, considering that they can be easily improved, and perhaps will be improved as time goes by are -1) Notification of a turn is sometimes given when you get too close. 2) The keyboard on the touchscreen is alphabetical (not querty). I prefer querty, since I am always on the computer, but I can see why they decided to go alphabetical.The only other silly disadvantage is, it does not have the mp3 player or bluetooth, which the nuvi 360 or nuvi 660 will have. They might be slightly better purchases, since they are more sleek. But this one is really a nice GPS, if you wish to only buy a navigation system, this might be the way to go.My advice, if you don't have one, go get it. If your budget is small, get the Garmin c340, if you have more money get the Nuvi 360 or 660. Or even better is to buy the Garmin GPS's which can be installed in the car, since they are out of sight from thieves, always available and have many more features. The one feature i miss is, multiple way points. Basically, this one gives you no choice of route. If you wish to see multiple choice for routes, you need to buy the more expensive units. I might get one of those down the line.This technology is almost as important and useful as the cell phone.  Don't waste your time reading reviews, go buy a latest GARMIN GPS unit now..."
4804,"It's impressive how you can use this memory card in any Olympus camera with this format. Fast to start, even in 4 o 5 megapixels camera. the landscaping pic's are clear with high definition. Portrait style are most wanted for me. short time for storage, and accepted on any cardreader with xD bay.An Olympus card for an Olympus camera, Yes, Sir..."
4805,"There's a good reason I bought another of the same device... it's great!  The old cable is fraying a bit due to abuse.  So, I stashed that in my desk as a spare and swapped it out with a new one.  I'm no gamer, but I do use a mouse 10 hours a day, and this one is solid."
4806,This mouse has a really great stlye.  It is very comfortable for your hand.  Well it is for mine and hubbys hands.  I have a small hand and his hand is large.  Alot of other mouses I bought were not just as comfortable for our hands.
4807,"When my old keyboard died, I was afraid that I wouldn't find another. Seems like every time I get used to something and come to love it, they change the design. I was very glad to find this keyboard again. I've never had the wrist pain on this one that I've had with others."
4808,I'm using this keyboard with my new compaq windows 7 64 bit and a 19 inch 4.3 acer monitor and love it
4809,"I've been a fan of Microsoft (MS) Ergonomic keyboards since they first came out and this one is the best by far.  The only thing I miss between this and the older model is the extra USB ports.  Why MS had to take that away I have no idea - they should have kept that. Still having it in black instead of the older white/clay color is nice and the location of all the buttons and the ability to configure shortcut buttons is wonderful. Everything I need is just a finger tip away.I have now had this board for about 4 years and it's still going strong and looks great and the keys still work like new.  My last one I had it for several years before it had problems - more my fault than MS's.If you're new to ergonomic keyboards it will take you a little while to get used to using one but now, I have trouble using a standard one. Regular keyboards seem so uncomfortable and awkward to use.Great investment not only because you won't need another for ages but also for your own personal comfort. Your wrists won't trouble you after typing for hours as older regular boards will."
4810,"Since I can no longer find this wireless at a decent price I have been forced to go wired, but it works as I need it to with the ergonomic support I need."
4811,"Affordable, fully featured, and most importantly, has that split AND raised design (with a front wedge, too) that makes it supremely comfortable to type on."
4812,"Great HDMI cable.  I'm very happy with the performance of this cable.  If you pay a lot for an HDMI cable, you're a fool."
4813,used this adapter to connect a usb adapter to make my printer wireless. and man dose it make work it's awesome and great for the price.
4814,Arrived on time.  Worked just like I expected it to. No problems with the order.  The price was cheaper than I could get it locally.
4815,"I bought this cord to connect a new 1TB WD external drive to my old Mac G5 tower--I needed to go from Firewire 800 (the WD drive) to 400 (the Mac). (The drive, of course, operates at the slower speed but when if I want to use it on a computer with Firewire 800, all I have to do is upgrade the cord.) This cord works perfectly and I'm glad it's 6' long because it gives me enough room to move it away from my work area a bit and clear up some desk space. I now have five external drives going on my desk and it's getting a little bit nuts with cords, so having one that's this long really is quite helpful.I know nothing of the technical quality of cords, but this works, it's like half the price (or less) than other brands and I can think of other things I'd rather spend the money on than cords."
4816,"I bought this awesome little clamp to go with the Kodak PlaySport video camera, with the intention of taking fishing videos in Canada last fall.  Well we got out on the water, I clamped the UltraClamp to the windshield of the fishing boat and just started filming.  The thing never budged, unless I wanted to change position, which is really easy to do.  I even used it when filming our moves to different fishing spots at over 30 mph!  You can see the UltraClamp being used in my video review of the Kodak Playsport here on Company A and see ""pop and the pike"" on youtube for another example.  Since I wanted to fish and not just take videos of my Dad and buddies fishing, this clamp was indispensable.  What a great find!  An innovative product made in America that really lives up to the hype."
4817,"I've had this unit about a year now and it still works great. This has the highest price/performance of any unit I researched. The black and white display is very visible in all lighting conditions.I just upgraded the maps to the latest (v9) from Garmin. It was $75.00 over the web. They ship the CD to you free and then when you try to install it, they let you figure out that you need to get a new unlock code. Still, $75 is cheaper than buying it retail.The complete North America v9 maps won't fit on a 1GB microSAN disk, so get the 2GB version. I ended up buying the microSAN (SDSDQ-2048-A10M) from Company A because it was cheaper with super saver shipping.I tried some other mounting ideas, but just buy the friction mounting kit from Garmin. It works great and is easy to use: just flop it on your dashboard."
4818,I have been able to make DVDs of our extensive vhs library for my special girl. This thing has been great.
4819,"This is the second pair of these I have purchased.  They are the best &#34;inexpensive&#34; phones out there.  The sound is extremely accurate and high quality.You can wear them all day and not feel any pain.  I wear glasses, and needed to find ear phones that would not hurt after an hour or so.  These phones do not squeeze so hard that they crush your eyeglasses into your head.  Great comfort."
4820,"I read the reviews on the MDR-7506 along with probably most Studio headphones.  The one thing that stood out most for me was the fact that the MDR-7506 has had more reviews than almost any other headphone bar none.  I was replacing a less than stellar pair of Senn HD201-s, but let's be realistic, for the price they are ""ok"".I got the MDR-7506's home and immediately unpacked them and connected them to my LiveWire AMP.  Comfort, well they fit my head perfectly well.  I wore them for 4 hours of continuous music.  Sound...... Stellar, excellent!  Rich Bass, the mids are outstanding, (an area the Senn's really lacked)and the highs are crisp and clean, every nuance is clear and precise.  I normally am not a fan of Sony products in general but I have to admit that even after the 300 plus reviews, I was still pleasantly surprised.  I DJ online, normally in 2 hour shifts and these cans will definitely make that a whole lot more fun.  I will update the Durability & Takes a beating categories in a few weeks.Overall, I would highly recommend these."
4821,"I've used the headphones heavily for 4 months now - I travel by plane a lot and work in a noisy environment - the headphones are great for both.I originally looked for noise reducing phones but found that the decent ones are very pricey, don't have great sound quality and comfort (the degree to which headphones reduce noise is largely determined on how tight the phones fit).I chose these as the best balance between sound quality, price, and noise reduction (fully covers ears).  I couldn't be happier with them.  They muffle out background noises effectively on the plane, allowing me to get lost in an audiobook or tune.  I often fall asleep with them on while traveling so I can vouch for their comfort.In the office they help me prevent distractions - ambiance audio works especially great to help keep me focused.  My ipod has no problem delivering plenty of volume through them.  I often wear them 4+ hrs. a day.  At times my ears get a bit warm but I think that's a trait of all ear-covering phones.They fold into themselves into a lump which fits into an included storage bag and fits well in my travel bag. Sound quality is excellent - my untrained ears can really hear differences in recording fidelity."
4822,I had to super glue the disk to my dash board (self adhesive pad didn't work too well) but the disk is on there now and the GPS unit suction cup holds to this disk great and it is at a convenient location on my dash board.
4823,"This affordable toy camera is renowned by artists around the globe, and for good reason too!  Once you take this bad boy out of it's box and load your 120 film, the fun begins. It's small and light enough to bring it almost everywhere. The pictures that come out of this camera are something. Don't bother picking up some electricians tape because unexpected light leaks are always fun. Saturation, colour, and vignetting add to my love of this camera. Save yourself some money and pair this up with the Lomo Colour Flash. You can use it with your other cameras for extra fun! Double exposures are no problem, just click away without advancing the film."
4824,"I bought these once they had a rebate, and am extremely happy with it.  The wired remote is great and easy to control with, and my iPod plugs happily into it.  The sound quality is good even at high volumes, and definitely better than my roommate's X-530 system (a 5.1 system, but priced the same).The bass for the Z-4 is pretty strong, and I usually have it turned up 1/3 to 1/2 of the max to prevent it from being too boomy.The sound is enough to fill a good sized room, so I don't know why people are complaining that it doesn't get loud enough.  They must have blasted their music and lost their hearing.At this price, the quality is unbeatable."
4825,"This wall mount is excellent.  Don't be confused by the description however. The ""horizontal"" adjustment is linear, in other words it moves lateraly from side to side rather than rotates.  But, this is a good feature if you have to locate studs to get a proper mount.  You can adjust the mount to hit the studs by the many mounting holes and then move the screen to adjust to the center.  Also, the package of bolts for connecting the flat screen should be tested in the flat screen mounting holes to make sure that you have the right bolts."
4826,"Not only does is this tripod have a simple, strong design, it's also very lightweight.  Compact and perfect for travel.  The velcro strap provides lots of uses for when those unexpected needs sneak up on you.  Keep in mind, it does not extend beyond what you see in the picture.  With it's rubber tipped legs, it serves as an excellent tabletop tripod for cameras, smartphones and smaller projectors.  Making it level is not a hassle either.  Great product."
4827,"Now that you have your own phone (rather than the one ""ma bell"" installed so many years ago) you likely have a 2.5mm jack somewhere on it.  If you don't own a headset for your phone it means you're getting Taco Neck Syndrome for nothing.I've owned other headsets in the past, and find the M210C comparable to other similarly-priced headsets.  They are light and comfortable and have acceptable sound quality for typical home use."
4828,I have been using Verbatim for a lot of years.  These disk's were no different.  Copied over 100 of these disks without a coaster.  I used my Brother printer to print to these disks and they all came out perfect.  I also use Verbatim lightscribe disks and again no coasters.
4829,"The 430EX works exceptionally well for all but the most demanding photography projects. The startup time is amazingly fast, making it possible to shoot within roughly 2-3 seconds of switching it on. This is very fast compared to earlier technologies where it would take 10-20 seconds for the flash to power up. I'm very pleased with the results of using the 430EX."
4830,"This year was tough for the firewall/routers on the home network.  In ten months I exchanged a Linksys BEFSX41 (bricked during a firmware upgrade) for a Linksys RT41-BU.  The Linksys RT41-BU was replaced with a Netgear FVS114.  The Netgear FVS114 seemed better than some but not as good as others, so I decided to get another firewall/router. I am glad I selected the mighty Buffalo WHR-G54S.  I have to say that I am impressed with the Buffalo WHR-G54S.  Out of the box, the user interface is simple and the system does what it says (i.e. switch, router, firewall, an access point). If a person replaces the stock firmware with DD-WRT, the unit suddenly becomes the best value for your money.  All I wanted was a simple firewall/router combo with an access point.  I now have that in a machine that does not mind telling me what it is doing and why."
4831,"After buying five different types of headphones, including  earbuds, by far the BOSE QC2 are the best headphones i've purchased. The sound has to be heard to be appreciated. As a result of buying these headphones, I've just ordered the Acoustic Wave System 2.....hope I can say the same about this system.5 years later these baby's sound as wonderful as they did the day I brought them.  I would buy another pair if something happened to these.  The sound is simple the best. I don't have one set that compairs to theses and I have alot of headphones and earbuds."
4832,"This is the third iPaq I've purchased in the last 5 years.  It has all the bells and whitles of the previous versions with the newer version of Windows Mobile. other than better memory management (a lot better, I might add) the only other difference Win Mobile 5 added was PowerPoint.The Bluetooth interface works better than previous versions.  I was able to set up a secure Bluetooh HotSync partnership in less than a minute.One issue I have to whine about is the fact that the wireless connectivity is still 802.11b.  Come on, 802.11g has been out for years, and yes, it uses more power than ""b"", but this is a handheld PC designed for Power Users.  I need the speed that ""g"" provides.  And another thing, the wireless management software included with the iPaq shows my signal strength at under 30% when I am standing 2 fee away from my wireless access point.  What is up with that?In any case, this is a device that, if you're already familiar with iPaqs and Windows Mobile, has no surprises in it.  It is dependable and solid.  The complaints I have are generally cosmetic and have no impact on the device's functionality.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a stable Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 5.If I had to do it all over again, I would!"
4833,I have used this for about 4 months with my Casio EX-Z850 digital camera. It has performed flawlessly from the first use. I couldn't ask for better performance.
4834,"Great value! Daughter loves her camera, takes it everywhere. So great to get more film at a better per picture price."
4835,This is such a great product it lets you marry two lenses together for what I like to call Super Macro Shots or S.M.S. for short.
4836,"Takes a bit of time to trim the material; however, it is easy to do to enable easy access to ports and on/off button.The light weight material folds neatly and quickly with Velcro straps to allow storage in a pouch.  Really helps improve visualization of the screen in top down driving."
4837,"This GB USB Flash Drive by Kingston is just what I needed for backing up all my documents from my computer.  Very small, easy to carry, and transports my files to other computers.  Very happy I made the purchase."
4838,"I moved from UK to US a couple of years ago and so did my laptop which had a UK style power cord. Most people keep using the laptop with travel adapters but if you read the fine print on them, it says: 'for temporary use only'. Besides, most of them do not have three prong ends so you give up the ground prong. Also, I have heard from experts that travel adaptors may generate circuit problems which may, in time damage, the connected device. This is a very handy solution. All you need is to take off the old power cord and put this into the adapter and you are all set. Since laptops can work in 100-240V 50-60Hz you don't need another measure to get your good friend working in its new home.There are several brands sold in Company A website. Some were even cheaper than this one, but due to the company reputation (belkin) and prime shipping advantage, I went for this particular one. It is exactly how it looks on the picture and so far, I have no issues. Connects in perfectly and does the job. I have purchased two and tried them in several different laptop adapters (friends visiting from overseas need it too) and it had no problems what so ever. So all I can say is I recommend this product to anyone who needs."
4839,"I replaced a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard with this RF Wireless Keyboard.  I will NEVER purchase a Bluetooth keyboard again.  It skipped letters, typed a ""zillion"" of one letter, and just plain did not work.  This new RF Wireless keyboard works flawlessly.  The design is very comfortable to use.  I really like the volume button, the Windows Media Player button, the pre-programmed keys that bring up Word, Excel and Powerpoint and I like the programmable keys.  All are very handy.  In addition to how good it works, it is very nice looking."
4840,"This is a superb camera at an unbelievable price.  The camera body is very  attractive, it's light and portable, and the controls are very easy and intuitive to use.  3.2MP is more than enough for very high quality prints, though I did add a 512k card.  Don't get all caught up with worrying about 3mp vs 5mp vs 7mp unless you plan to print lots of poster size images.  Now I can take and store 400 pictures on one battery charge with the LCD on.  Simply amazing technology.I compared all kinds of cameras under $500, and this one not only does everything I need, but it's very affordable.  This will keep me happy for many years to come.  Now what to do with all the $$$ I saved...Update: June 2008  I still love this camera and continue to use it frequently.Update: May 2010  I still love this camera and see no reason to upgrade, it rocks!  This baby has now been around the world and taken amazing shots everywhere, day and night.Thank you Cannon!  We need more companies like you instead of the usual cyclical consumption greedy bastard, engineered failure garbage that we usually get at WalMart.I'm a Cannon fan for life because of this amazing camera."
4841,"I have had this projector for 2 years now. I was using the s-video input (with a 25 foot Acoustic Research cable) for DVDs, playstation 2, and digital cable television. I was always happy with the picture but whites were always fuzzy - you could see static on the screen (in my case a white wall). It took some research to find out that sVGA is the same as component video. So I experimented with a long component video to VGA cable (35 ft.). In order for this work with cable, I had to upgrade to a HDTV box because they are the only ones Cox Cable has with component video output (and hdmi of course). WOW...not only was the picture quality for regular cable increased - the EP719 takes the 1080i HDTV signal through this cable no problem (even recognizes it on screen as HDTV in the lower right corner). HDTV is so awesome on this projector. HUGE crystal clear HDTV quality resolution. DVDs are also much clearer too. That white fuzziness was completely eradicated.I wanted to experiment with the HDMI to DVD-D conversion as I imagine the picture will be even better. But in order run everything (cable, ps2, dvd) through my stereo receiver with one cable to the projector I had to stick to one cable type - component video being it.There is absolutely no need to buy an expensive plasma or LCD when for a fraction of the cost you can get the same high-res picture quality with a screen six times the size.No Problems either. Get yourself a component video to VGA cable (dirt cheap on ebay). Or if you have a new receiver that has hdmi inputs, you can use all hdmi cables and then connect one hdmi cable with an hdmi-dvi-d converter and get the max out of your projector. Although, I have read that long runs of hdmi lose quality over 10 ft. whereas with component video you are ok up to 50 feet with no signal loss."
4842,It was like new with all items included in the original New Product. What a buy! Thank you for a great product!
4843,Used for video with a 3ti this is the one lens for all situations except low light something for take in consideration
4844,"I recently lost my Giottos MM9180.  I loved it so much, I bought it again immediately.The product comes very well packaged and includes a carrying case.  However, if you mount a ballhead, the case is too short. Since I usually prefer not to carry it in a case anyway, it was no big deal for my situation- but may be to yours.  The monopod itself has a high quality build equal to the much more expensive Gitzo brand, which I have owned before. In my opinion, it also compared better to many other monopods from previous brands I owned such such as Vanguard, Induro, and Manfrotto; though none of those other brands are slouches in any regard.The Giottos MM9180 does not use lever locks.  Instead, it relies upon twist locks. Your selection is of course a matter of personal preference.  I hear arguments all the time how lever locks are ""so much faster"" in adjusting the monopod.  After years of shooting events, location, street photography, I can tell you I have never been in a situation where I needed the extra few seconds of speed the lever locks would provide. But, once again, that is all a matter of shooting preference you develop after years of shooting. I found the MM9180 adjustments to be fast, sure, smooth, and very easy to make.The monopod build and design is very sturdy and I found the weight of the monopod to be a plus.  In fact, I wish it were heavier frankly for my purposes (I travel with another lighter and shorter monopod- theInduro AM25 Alloy 8M Monopod (Black)and use this monopod for event/ portrait shooting.  The swivel monopod foot is a great feature compared to monopods without such feet.  It provides a sturdier surface (better contact with ground) and a swivel feature that maintains full contact with the ground, unlike monopods that only have a very small point as a foot, without and swivel ability.  This may seem like a small feature, but when I am shooting cheerleading events, I am thankful everytime I use it.  I wish the foot was a little larger, like theGitzo G1410.130B 80mm Large Foot, but I believe the Gitzo foot can be used on the Giottos monopod (I plan on trying it out and will report back when I do).  Giottos does not seem to make a larger foot.  The height of the monopod is also perfect for me at 6 feet tall.  Since this is my non-traveling monopod, I prefer extra height and weight.My current ball head of choice for my monopods is theGiottos MH7001-621 Ball Head with 621 Quick Release Plate.  I prefer the wider plate, for better contact (once again, a matter of preference) because it seems to help reduce vibration transfer. Since I am huge believer in flash photography, I also use theCustom Brackets CB Junior Kitwith the monopod by attaching the plate to the bottom of the bracket.Carbon Fiber Vs. Aluminum DebateOnce again, after years of shooting and using both aluminum and carbon fiber monopods, I never found the weight difference a big enough issue to justify spending a lot more money on carbon fiber monopods. In the case of monopods, in most cases, the difference is less than a 1/4 pound.  Large tripods on the other hand, are a different story.  Even then, in my opinion, the increased cost is justified only if you are carrying the tripod long distances.  Otherwise, aluminum will serve you very well.Bottom line, anyone level of photographer purchasing the MM9180 will be thrilled with its performance and durability."
4845,"i've tried many different earphones ranging from just a few dollars to over a hundred dollars and have never been satisfied.the shure's that i purchased were very uncomfortable and hurt no matter how i tried to configure them.i wanted to find another in ear set that looked easy to install but yet sound nice,..after looking at about everything there was,i decided to give ultimate ears a try..these ultimate ears super fi3's are super easy to fit in the ears,they sound every bit as good or better than the shure's and they are so comfortable that you forget that you're wearing them.maybe some day i'll try the fi 5's but for now,my search is over."
4846,THis product is everything and a bit more than we needed for the newly purchased laptop.  It has plenty of space to store items and is durable.
4847,"Both Sony and Carl Zeiss deserve ample praise for producing the best high-end digital still camera currently available. Indeed, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-R1 is the subject of a superb test report in the January/February 2006 issue of American Photo, in which the headline reads, ""...combines the convenience of an electronic viewfinder camera with the image quality of a D-SLR"". The magazine compared its performance with a Canon Rebel XT and two EF-S Canon zoom lenses at various ISO settings; judging from the pictures I saw, the Cyber-shot yielded images with better contrast than the Canon's (However, the American Photo article observed that the Cyber-shot images were slightly grainier at an ISO range of 160 to 400, more noticeable at 800, and especially so at 1600 and above; at 3200 the images were unusable in stark contrast to those from the Canon Rebel.). The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-R1 has an ultra-wide Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* zoom lens (24mm to 120mm), whose optical performance I truly believe is second to none, and which American Photo recognizes as an ""image-quality breakthrough"".The camera itself is quite handy and ergonomically superb, weighing less than a similar D-SLR with a corresponding zoom lens. It probably resembles more a 6 x 4.5cm medium format SLR than a 35mm D-SLR in its overall appearance. The Zeiss zoom lens has T* multicoating to reduce flare and enhance contrast of images, but perhaps more important for the user, has an easily grippable zoom ring and another for fast manual focusing. If there is indeed a major weakness in this Sony Cyber-shot, then it does not come with an optical image stabilizer, and yet, I think that photographic situations regarding such usage would be quite rare, even with this camera for the typical user. Furthermore, I suspect that those most interested in this camera will want highest image quality for most photographic situations - and would not mind the absence of this feature - and here the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-R1 truly excels. So I agree with the American Photo reviewer that this camera truly represents a major advance in image quality for compact digital still cameras."
4848,"I loved my wired Mighty Mouse until the scroll ball just wouldn't work any longer. And I love the Bluetooth version, but I do have to clean the scroll ball about every week or two. I just flip it upside down and roll it with a rubbing-alcohol-induced towel. I'm sure at some point it'll eventually give up entirely, like the old one, but I love the action, weight, etc. It gets heavy, daily use."
4849,this is a component hd av cable for this low price i have to say its a good deal go get it
4850,"I have a socket right behind my bed that a normal plug extends to far into the mattress & cloth & electrical plugs worry me. So, I bought this flush cord & it works great. I would by again."
4851,"A bit tricky to fold back up into it's compact form - so pay attention when you open it up!  The reflective coating is not solid - it's alternating reflecting strips and white strips, each about 1/8"" wide. This creats a softer - and less bright - light."
4852,"I used to have 4 memory sticks of the old ones with my old cybershot, but with a purchase of a new camera I decided to buy only 1, but a very large one...I have taken many many shots and videos in high res and I have downloaded them to my computer and I cant complain, its very fast, reliable and no problems whatsoever.  I recommend it if you are a user who takes many many shots..."
4853,"This camera really delivers. I appraise real estate and take from 40 - 100 pix a week.  I want a SLR for serious work, but this camera is great for appraisal work because it is so handy. I have a clipboard in one hand and a laser measuring device in the other with the camera in my shirt pocket. I can switch LMD and camera as needed.I was afraid it would be easy to lose but so far so good and I haven't dropped it nearly as often as my Coolpix 4300 which I gave to my assistant.The one annoying feature is the on/off switch. It is difficult to depress and must be held down momentarily to operate. A far better system is a lens cover which slides back from the lens to turn on and close to turn off.  That is the only improvement I would recommend"
4854,Got the code online. Redeemed it at xbox.com. Got my points. Pretty simple. Just what I needed for some Dance Central dlc.
4855,"It came in the time frame, it worked, what more can you ask for? They should just make it a downloaded code to make it easier, but im not one to talk"

4857,It worked exactly as it was advertised. The online code was e-mailed quickly and worked.  Perfect for a gift as well.
4858,It is the best choice if you want to add some Microsoft Points to your account&#8230; I strongly recommend this prepaid card instead of using your credit card through the Xbox 360 Interface. I do not like the idea of giving MS my credit card information...

4860,"The SlingShot 100 has been my field bag for a few weeks and I consider it an indispensable, revolutionary product in how it enables easy access to your camera. In actual use, it's far more intuitive than the traditional top-loading shoulder bag or backpack, where a few quick motions allow easy access to your gear. Yet, with this great side-opening feature comes a few cautions, which I will note at the end.I'm also impressed by the sleek, compact profile of this bag, making it well-suited for outdoor use in cramped environments or where free body motion is essential. Whether you're pushing your way through a dense rainforest or navigating a crowded urban street, you'll appreciate there's little to catch on natural growth--or the attention of onlookers. With that sleekness comes a necessity to pack lightly for a day's shoot. If you have a more than 2 lenses, you should consider the Slingshot 200 or 300, as I can just fit my Nikon D70S, plus a 60mm and 18-70mm in this bag. Update: I am going to buy the Slingshot 200 for my D200, as it won't fit well in this bag.The SlingShot100 uses quality materials and good workmanship that should endure a lot of use. If there's any room for improvement, it could have slightly denser foam padding to protect against unforeseen shocks. I would also prefer thicker padding in the strap to soften the weight after hours of use. The memory pocket is a great feature, and the accessory pockets are useful and well-divided. However, this pack could really use secure clips for keys and other items in the event the zippers work themselves open. This brings me to the most glaring shortcoming of this pack--which is also its best feature! Under hours of use, zippers can work themselves open, especially if the bag is packed tightly. This is particularly hazardous in a side-loading bag, because your camera could work itself out of the bag and suffer an expensive fall. For added security, the two zipper pulls should lock together, or there should be an internal clip to secure the camera in the bag. For my own peace of mind, I'm going to add both."
4861,"I gotta say, this tiny little dock is amazing... it makes it SO EASY to hook your new Nano to just about anything that will receive a stereo mini jack. I tried it at the Apple store at the local mall before I bought it at Company A. They had it connected to a variety of computers, speakers, and other media devices. It's fantastic how this tiny interface increased the flexibility and usefulness of the newest addition to the iPod family. It's SO COOL! Get one! At this price, buy two!"
4862,"This camera is worth getting if you have a laptop that doesn't have a built in Camera.  I used it for Skyping and broadcasting on Justin.tv.  For it's price it might be worth getting if your laptop camera is subpar.  The picture quality is above average (About the same as a Macbook)and its built in microphone that works great too.  As another reviewer stated, the webcam can potentially get up to 30 fps.Though it is intended for laptops, I use it for my desktop and it is still good.  The only problem is that the cord is too short and not typically suited for desktops.  As another reviewer stated, the cord might even be too short for bigger laptops.  But even so, this will only prevent you from clipping it where you want.  Finally, it comes with a leather nice case that you can store it when not in use.  Also if your wondering, you do not have to install a CD for the camera to work."
4863,"I did not purchase these earphones separately, but I got them along with my creative muvo 512MB mp3 player. I compared the quality of these earphones to the Sony earphones I recently purchased ( Sony MDR-E827G Sport Earbuds) just to make me feel better that I purchased as good or better earphones. However, I found that my creative earphones produced way fuller and clearer sound than the Sony ones I just purchased! I was happy that my existing earphones were the better ones, but also sad that my new purchase wasn't satisfactory. So basically, what I'm saying is, these creative earphones are awesome;) The foams did fall out a couple of times but they did so when I was pulling the earphones out of my crowded backpack. If you're careful with them, you'll be ok."
4864,"I ordered three of these for Christmas, but found out that the people I was going to give two of them to already had webcams.The one I kept worked fine. It works like it should -- no problems, no installation hassles and the light adjustment software works well. The microphone works OK too, you don't have to shout to make yourself heard. I use the webcam on an XP system with Yahoo messenger as the communication software. The webcam picture will occasionally freeze but the voice does not, and the picture unfreezes after a while.The two returns were accepted by Company A without problems. I had to pay shipping because it wasn't Company A's fault that the webcams were returned, but this wasn't out of line. They printed out a pre-paid return shipping label and a return slip, so I just put the slip in the box and the label on the box and sent it back. The return was really hassle free."
4865,Ordered this to put on my second bike to use the same Garmin 500 on both. Easy to install and setup.  Once you familiarize switching from bike 1 to bike 2 it is really simple.
4866,"The cadence sensor works great with my Garmin Forerunner 305. Easy install, easy syncing, very accurate. I wish I would have bought it sooner!"
4867,"Good glass filter,works just fine, gives my lens good protection, likeit is not there on the lens, highly recommeded to anybody."
4868,"The nice thing about the Hoya Pro1 line of UV filters is that there's much lens flare than on other cheaper filters. There are probably others that do the job just as well, but I'm very happy with this line and it's on all my lenses."
4869,"Easy to setup (took less than 45 minutes).Strong Wi-Fi signal, works fine two rooms across.Very useful and convenient as it has both wired and wireless options.  I use the wired option (LAN connection) for my desktop computer and VOIP phone and the wireless for my laptop.Definitely recommend it."
4870,"I wasn't expecting much for the price when I upgraded from my original Palm Pilot IIIxe, but find this PDA very functional!  It's compact, and has plenty of features to be my auxilliary brain and more.  The memory is plenty for the significant amount of data I like to have at hand for both work and home, as well as 2 complete Bibles and Concordance.  It's a really nice feature to have family photos available to show off, and  some of the extras, like carb counter, splash shopper, and games are also useful. I find the battery life very good even though I use it  quite a lot.  I'm enjoying it tremendously!addendum: after over a year of use, it has held up very well.  Battery life remains very good, no problems with unit at all.  Still using original silicone sleeve which shows no wear."
4871,Truly plug and play! Good price and good performance. Highly recommended for playing all those Mp3 files through the home theater system.
4872,This flange was part of the final set of hardware I used to finish off my DIY home theater install. The flange is designed so that you can use a piece of 1.5&#34; NPT threaded pipe (also called generically &#34;black pipe&#34;) to provide the required drop from a ceiling to the level where you want to mount a projector. NOTE: you will have to purchase a mount for your projector that uses that same 1.5&#34; NPT interface (I used this: &#34;Peerless PRGUNV Company J Gear Universal Projector Mount - Black&#34; also purchased on Company A).To use this flange you have to be able to use the supplied lag bolts to secure it to your ceiling joists. For me this meant crawling into the attic and securing 2x4 &#34;cripples&#34; between a couple of ceiling joists. Another Note: try not to do this on a 90 degree summer day - learn from my mistake. Once I had the cripples installed and pre-drilled for the lag bolts the installation went smoothly.One thing that may or may not be important for you: you will see that there is an access hole on the slanted art of the flange. I used this so that I could feed an AC cord down to my projector. Peerless thoughtfully supplies a rubber grommet for this opening so that your cords don't get abraded. With the flange I received a part of the metal fabrication stuck out into the opening. This meant that I had to do some field surgery on the grommet to make it fit properly. It wasn't a big deal and 2 minutes with my small wire cutters did the trick.
4873,"I have been a ""professional"" photographer for many years. By ""professional"" I mean people do pay me to take their family photos, wedding photos, etc. on a part time basis.As a traditionalist I use to use 35mm and medium format cameras. However, expense in both equipment, film and processing made me look to digital.I have used small point and shoot digital cameras for personal use and have loved the convenience.I bought the Evolt E500 kit at a local Sam's Club about 9 months ago.I had looked at many other brands and did not want to spend $3,000 on something I would use once or twice a month professionally.I am so glad. I bought the Evolt for about $660 and I love it! You cannot beat the price for a quality camera and two quality lenses.Take the time to read the manual and buy a basic SLR photo book so you can get creative with the manual settings.I cannot tell the difference in my photos with this camera and competitors from $900-$3,000."
4874,"This little device does everything it sets out to do very well.  The best part is that it is battery powered and you can use it in any situation.  I've used it to navigate while walking!  It tells you, ""Walk this way and that way"".  The little MP3 player is cool - and the translator actually works.Nice.  I would pick this above all others in its price range.  No doubt."
4875,"Plain and simple, the Garmin nuvi 350 paid for itself on our first trip using it. There are plenty of reviews of this unit that will tell you how great and wonderful it is and they're all true. It's slim, it's lightweight, it fits perfectly onto my windshield, it's easy to follow as it guides you, it's easy to read the maps, the text-to-speech is fabulous, and so on and so forth. However, I'd like to go a step beyond that glossed-over view of this GPS unit and give examples of how the unit made a difference during the first trip that we used it.=== Getting From Here to There ===One of the main benefits of having a GPS device is having it guide you from Point A to Point B. As we began our trip, we docked the nuvi 350 in the suction cup holder we had placed at the bottom-center of our windshield (it was low enough that I could still see the hood of my car over the top of the GPS unit, thereby avoiding any distraction/obstacle from the unit) and started our trip.We were located in Charlottesville, VA and wanted to get to a small town outside of Raleigh, NC and plugged in the address. Right away, the nuvi had us on the Interstate and headed in the right direction.Pretty quickly, though, it wanted us to get off at an exit and take a US-highway. I ignored the device and stayed on the Interstate and it quickly announced, ""Recalculating..."" and gave us a new route based on our continuation. It did this sequence of events several times before it finally took me on a route that stayed on the Interstate as long as possible.I was using the default settings and had assumed it would keep me on the Interstates, but it seemed to think US-highways were quicker and I think this is because it doesn't seem to take into account possible red lights. No matter, it got us to our destination with no problems.=== Where Are Your Keys? ===We were staying with some relatives just outside of Raleigh, NC and had gone out shopping on Christmas Eve Eve. We came back and the relatives realized they had locked themselves out of their house. They placed a call to their usual locksmith and he was out shopping and wouldn't be back for some time. A call to the new home builder didn't give any better results. Suddenly, my fiancee asked, ""What about the GPS?""I removed the unit from the car and pressed ""Menu,"" then ""Where To?,"" then ""Spell Name,"" and typed in ""locksmith."" The unit then started searching the area (it already remembered where we were) and found a locksmith that was just 11 miles away. The great thing about the information provided is that it doesn't just give you the address; it also gives you the phone number! We called the locksmith and he was at the house in 30 minutes.Without the GPS unit, we would have spent at least that much time trying to find someone through traditional means.Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue!=== We Need Help ===While we were trying various methods of home entry, one of our relatives injured himself and needed to be taken to an outpatient facility for some stitches (yes, the lost keys proved to create quite an ordeal). After the locksmith got us in the house, the relative called to say that he had no way to pay because he hadn't taken his wallet. Feeling confident with the GPS in tow, I offered to take his wallet to him. His wife gave me directions and I headed out on a mini-adventure.While I was driving to the outpatient facility, I got to see one of the cool features of this product. The sun was setting as I was driving and suddenly a message popped up on the GPS screen that said, ""Sunset. Switching to nighttime mode."" And without any need for me to push any buttons or anything, it switched to nighttime mode, which features a darker map (black land, instead of light tan land) so that the unit's not so bright and hard on the eyes during nighttime driving.Thankfully, I took the GPS unit with me, because I was given slightly incorrect directions. If I had taken a right, as I was told, instead of a left, like the GPS told me, I would have ended up in Raleigh and not the outpatient facility.Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue!... again.=== It's Time to Eat ===After visiting the relatives, we drove from Raleigh, NC to Gatlinburg, TN to see more relatives. About halfway through the drive, we both got hungry and decided to see if the GPS unit could find us a place to eat. We pressed ""Menu,"" then ""Where to?,"" then ""Food,"" then ""All Food,"" and a list of restaurants popped up, complete with distance and direction information.We didn't like any of the options listed, so we left the screen alone. The cool thing is that the screen continued to refresh and update the distances and directions and as new places to eat got closer they replaced the ones that we had already passed. It was like having an interactive food finder right in our car!Eventually, we decided to find a Texas Roadhouse and pressed ""Spell"" and entered ""Texas R."" The unit quickly found one 6 miles ahead on our route and we entered it as a ""Route Marker."" The unit adjusted it's directions for us and we were soon enjoying a great meal.The interesting thing is that this particular Texas Roadhouse didn't have any signage on the Interstate, nor did it have any when we exited. In other words, without the GPS unit, we would have never known it existed!Also, this little ""detour"" gave us a chance to experience how the GPS unit adjusts its timing based on your speed. When driving 70 MPH on the Interstate, it gave us the turn directions 0.7-0.8 miles before the turn. However, while on the city roads after exiting the Interstate, the unit gave us the turn directions 0.2-0.3 miles before the turn. As a result, the directions were always timely and never too early or too late.Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue!...again!!=== Want to Come Over? ===We continued to experience the value provided by this GPS unit throughout our trip. To take advantage of all of its abilities, we programmed in our relative's home location when we got to Gatlinburg.Later in the week, after dinner, we were headed back to the hotel when the relative called and asked if we wanted to come over. ""Sure,"" we said and we hopped in the car, turned on the GPS unit and pressed ""Menu,"" then ""Where to?,"" then ""My Locations,"" then found the relative's listing and pressed ""Go!"" The unit gave us flawless directions and even found a way to the relative's house that the relative was unaware of. We told the relative this and they tried the route at a later date and said how much better of a route it was.Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue!... yet again!=== No More Traffic Jam ===After Gatlinburg, we headed to Atlanta, GA. We were just outside of Atlanta and started to hit some pretty major traffic. We then saw one of those electronic information signs that said the time to the next exit was going to be over 12 minutes. The exit was only 4 miles away! Drive less than 20 MPH on an Interstate? No thanks.We pressed ""Menu,"" then ""Detour"" and the GPS unit had us get off at the exit we were at, took us down a few side roads, then had us on a major road that paralleled the Interstate. I should say right now that without the Text-to-Speech capabilities that allowed the unit to say the street names we were supposed to turn onto, we would have been lost in the maze of Atlanta intersections. Roads were oftentimes so close to one another that a ""Turn right in 500 feet"" would have had us choosing between two roads with a coin flip. With Text-to-Speech, we always knew exactly what road to be on. Also, we only realized that the road we ended up on paralleled the Interstate after we looked at the GPS map as it was detouring us. We never would have known about it otherwise.Easily within the 12 minutes it would have taken us just to get to the next exit, we were at our destination and didn't have to endure stop-and-go traffic on the Interstate.Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue!=== Let's Go Home ===After a long and exhausting trip, we got in the car, turned on the unit and pressed, ""Menu,"" then ""Where to?,"" then ""My Locations,"" then ""Go Home."" The unit not only calculated the route, it also informed us that we'd be at Home Sweet Home at 4:00 that evening.We followed the directions as the unit had us traveling just Interstates this time. I was thankful on more than a couple of occasions that it alerted me to stay to the left or right as we approached major Interstate interchanges. I could have easily screwed up in the middle of one with my exhausted mind and ended up on an Interstate to California.A few minutes after 4:00 that evening, we heard the unit say, ""Arriving at Home"" and we were simultaneously happy to be home and happy that we had spent the money on such a valuable device.Throughout our trip, the Garmin nuvi 350 proved its value to us. We're the kind of people who are perfectly okay with reading maps and planning out our own trips, but driving through the middle of Downtown Atlanta without any fear of getting lost because you know your GPS unit will get you unlost is well worth this unit's price tag.Over and over again, it was the Garmin nuvi 350 to the rescue. We won't leave home without it!"
4876,"Great product, but the one thing I have found with all GPS units are that they always take you through the most urban areas. In my own town I would never take the routes it suggests due to mostly heavy traffic patterns and high crime neighbors. With that in mind I wonder where it will navigate me when I'm in a strange town?"
4877,"I read everything I could find on the Web about this unit and several of its competitors.  I finally ordered the nuvi 350 from Company A, and I'm thrilled that I did.  It's as good as everyone claims it is.. and I can't help being continually astonished at how small it is!The U.S. maps seem very comprehensive, finding small streets and shortcuts in Atlanta.  I'm planning to buy the Brazilian maps and the Portuguese translation options (the built-in demo is very convincing) for travels in Brazil.  Company A's price was low enough that I can buy both of those and still come out ahead compared to local retail stores selling the exact same unit for $800!"
4878,"Have you heard about COWON JetAudio before? May be, but not me. I spent about six month researching different players before I came across this player on Company A.com. After reading all these exciting reviews and being backed by the Company A 30 day satisfaction guarantee I decided to pull the trigger. My main criteria for it was the sound quality and capacity. I could care less about it's photo and video abilities. As I start listen to it sound quality totally exceeded my expectations after all those disappointing in store tests for... well let's not name the names.A hefty 60 gig should satisfy my needs for long time to go. This unit has a bright 160 x 128-pixel, 1.8"" TFT LCD screen and you can set a custom wall paper on it. It displays all necessary info about your file such as bit rate, EQ setting, volume, play mode, file format, sound settings and more.Let me start from highlights:1. Great, great sound quality, with or without all those sound enhancement features such as bass compensation, MP3 enhancement, surround sound and more.2. AM/FM radio listen/record, voice recording with built in mike - a big plus.3. This unit has a USB host mode. It means you can connect multiple USB devices such as digital cameras, card readers, or MP3 players and exchange files without PC! For me it's a huge plus. Being photo enthusiast, now I do not have to buy more flash cards. All I do is connecting my CF reader to this baby and upload files to iAudio's HD, and vola, my card is ready for another set of shots. No need to carry a laptop anymore.4. Plug and play device. As soon as you plug it in to your PC it sees it as just regular hard drive. Just drag and drop your music, photo, text and etc. files and you done (except video which you want to watch on this player and have to covert it using JetAudio soft). No additional software is needed unlike with other players.5. Widest range of supporting sound formats from MP3 and WMA to linear (uncompressed, CD-quality) WAV files, Ogg Vorbis files (which yields a better sound quality than MP3 for files of comparable size), as well as FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec, compressed but designed for 1:1 encode/decode).6. Navigation menu is very intuitive. I barely read the manual. It's amazing how many operations can be done with this tiny joystick.7. Ability to have five customizable presets for five band equalizer - big factor for me.8. Different play modes( shuffle/repeat/continuous within all/folder/subfolder)9. Ability to assign a function short cut to two existing buttons REC and Pause/Play, so you don't have to browse through the menu to get to the equalizer settings or play mode (in my personal case)10. Ability to create play lists on the fly and plays the ones created on your WinAmp.11. Virtually unscratchable body and screen unlike others complaining about iPod.And now time for small turn offs which I can absolutely leave with.1. Cradle should've been included2. I'd really prefer to have Input/Output/USB/DC sockets built into the player and not being a part of that cheaply made plastic addendum that can be easily broken or lost.3. Rubber plug for docking port protection is not attached to the unit. Easy to lose. Why couldn't the do it as with the USB host port.4. Good quality headphones but odd design. One of the wires is 10"" longer than the other to the spot where they bind together. Very annoying5. While plugged to the PC's USB cannot play files. The only options is charging or HD device.6. Every time you change  settings (volume, EQ set, shuffle FF REW and etc) the screen is lights up that shorten your battery life. Would be nice to have feature to disable such behavior.7. No carrying case. The leather one that Cowon offers is ugly. Don't buy it.8. Little thicker (5mm) than the 20/30Gb version, similar to X5L models.This player does support ID3 tags and displays it on the screen while playing your file. It does not supports ID3 database which is the matter of firmware update, I think, and I could care less about it. Video conversion software does a god and fast job of converting videos.I really enjoyed watching those videos on its LCD screen. Plays much smoother than you would think for 15fps video files, a big plus. But again video was not my priority.Overall this is a very compact player packed with lots of unparalleled features that are absent in other players, combined all together in this solid performer. Sound quality and more sound quality. I'm very happy with this purchase. Highly recommend."
4879,"I just received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Wow.  It's much better than my prior MP3 player.  The former player (a much smaller unit - I think a Nomad) was also a Creative, which lasted for several years and many hours in the gym.  I even dropped the prior one, and it still works well.  Therefore, I expect my Zen Microphoto to perform as well and to last as long.  I've had no trouble transferring music from my laptop or listening to it on the Zen Microphoto.  The controls are very easy to use and adjust through the menu screens.  I also purchased the Traveldock to take it on the road and charge it when not connected to the computer.  (I should mention that my partner has a Creative 30GB Nomad Jukebox Zen Nx which has lasted about 3 years so far and has been used very frequently when travelling, at home, at the gym, etc.  I believe that our experience with Creative products demonstrates that they are excellent and reliable.)"
4880,Excellent replacement for a lost or damaged power cable for our Garmin. We thought we'd lost our original but wound up finding it after we ordered this one. Both of them perform flawlessly.
4881,bought this item as a gift for my son who has a job that requires him to go to homes to service their cable hook-ups. he loves it. everytime we speak he brings up how awesome it is. fast delivery also.
4882,"The bottom line with this player is that it runs circles around virtually any LCD, Plasma or DLP TV setup you'll ever see at those big-box electronics stores. AND it's cheaper than any of them! It is as good (or bad) as the quality of the signal you feed into it.Now, I won't go into all of the technical details but I want to tell you what is the optimal setup for this projector, consistent with being budget conscious. I have spent countless hours studying this and experimenting with the various setup parameters, so I humbly offer you the benefit of my research. My pain, your gain (ha!).My primary use for the projector is to watch my extensive DVD collection. I have also fed it a standard TV signal but, as mentioned, it is so revealing that is shows the deficiency of such a signal. I will eventually connect it to an HDTV signal, but for now it is strictly used for watching movies on DVD.I have the Panasonic PT-AE900U connected to an OPPO OPDV971H player via a 5-meter DVI to HDMI cable. The Panasonic sits on a shelf behind my viewing area 45 inches above the floor and just about dead center relative to the center of my Model C Da-Lite 119-inch diagonal HDTV, high-contrast matte white screen. One word: OUTSTANDING.Of course, this is just for the video end of things. I have the Oppo connected via digital optical out to my Denon Dolby Digital receiver and 5.1 speaker setup.The Panasonic's 1280x720 panels are made to display HDTV 720p in native format. There are two ways to achieve this with the Oppo using its DVI output: Set the Oppo to feed the Panasonic a 720p signal, in which case the Oppo does the upscaling; or feed the Panasonic a 480p signal from the Oppo and let the Panasonic do the upscaling. Feeding the Panasonic an Oppo-upscaled 1080i signal is also possible, but this yields no benefit since the AE900U would then have to downscale the previously upscaled signal. In real-world tests this doesn't look good, either.Feeding the Panasonic an Oppo-upscaled 720p signal looks terrific - even better than feeding the Panasonic a 480p signal from the Oppo and letting the Panasonic do the upscaling. The difference, though slight, is noticeable. I have A/B'd the images and the Oppo 720p feed has better contrast and more detail. However, such a signal input then limits the zoom options available to you from the Panasonic. Certain widescreen/letterboxed non-anamorphic movies were distorted, unless you played them exactly as projected by the Oppo (at about 66% the screen size) with no zoom. Using the Oppo's zoom feature to fill the screen produced terrible results.For such movies I fed the Panasonic a 480p signal from the Oppo and let the Panasonic do the upscaling. Voila! Scaling in the Panasonic is accomplished with proprietary Panasonic video processing electronics. The end result is superb. Additionally, feeding the Panasonic a 480p signal from the Oppo allows you greater flexibility with the Panasonic's zoom feature. This allows me to fill my 119-inch diagonal screen. With the Panasonic, zooming -- when desired -- still produces an outstanding image.There are numerous, almost endless, ways to setup the video to your own taste insofar as fiddling with the brightness, contrast, etc., on both the Panasonic and the Oppo. My experiments show that the optimal, most accurate picture was achieved by leaving the Oppo set to its default settings and setting the Panasonic to 'Natural' which, according to the AE900 manual, is 'To reproduce the color of the image faithfully from the image source.' Assuming the DVD was properly mastered, this is exactly what I want to see. I was watching movies as diverse as 'Finding Nemo', 'Out Of Africa', 'Jeremiah Johnson', 'Spartacus', 'Father Goose', 'The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (B&W;) and some classic 'Star Trek' episodes, and ALL looked absolutely gorgeous! It is clear that, when being fed a direct digital signal from the Oppo DVD player as outlined above, the 'Natural' setting is the one to use. Whatever is on the film is exactly what is reproduced - period. All other modes are useful only if you are feeding it some other type of signal.The Panasonic PT-AE900U, when setup as I have outlined, produces a stunning 119-inch diagonal picture in my very small (12' x 12') apartment living room. It is hard to imagine that it could be improved upon. For the price -- especially with the current rebate -- this is a NO-BRAINER! Watch your friends, who spent 2-3x as much on a screen half to one-fourth the size, drool with envy when you blow them out of the water with a crystal-clear 119-inch image!ENJOY!"
4883,"i have purchased several of these cases for the cameras used at work.  the crews like this case because it is small and compact and can fit the camera and charger.  not much else, but then again, they don't need to carry much else in their camera cases.  the case is durable and well made.  the guys put their things through the ringer and these certainly hold up.  lower makes really great products."
4884,"This is one of the best laptops on the market.  The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.The good* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.Not so good* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.* The hard drive is light for the price.  Company A sells 1TB 2.5"" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one."
4885,"A fraction of the price of OEM and no discernible difference in look, quality or battery life. What a bargain"
4886,I can't believe I bought those in May 2006 - I still use both and they work and hold batery as new. thats great!
4887,"I'm rather new w/ a SLR, but this lense is great. It focuses sharply, and rather quickly. It's quiet, and easy to use. For the price, it provides a nice photo and zoom experience."
4888,"I bought my first one about a year ago and use it every day to listen to podcasts during my walk. I also use it the car for music and podcasts when I Travel. I made the mistake of putting some music, that my wife liked, on it and letting her it for a few days. Now I have 2 or should I say I have the old one and she has the new one. For the money you can't go wrong."
4889,"The other reviewers are right. This product (number (32509360)) is the 'regular', not U3, version of the drive. The U3 version product number is 32509363.I have been using an earlier version of the 'regular' 512mb traveldrive - for nearly a year, for much of my data. I have been very happy with it - no data corruption or throughput problems. I don't know the actual rates, though. Tom's Hardware has a summary of data transfer speeds for a small number of UFDs(USB Flash Drives). So does ArsTechnica. Enjoy."
4890,the flash drive holds many photos that I have collected over the years.  My slides and those of my parents
4891,I have several of these SD cards. I find this one to be one of the best .  I would recommend it.
4892,The SanDisk 4 GB Class 2 SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDB-4096-A11 has proven to be a reliable and affordable storage media. I have used these cards in the past and will continue to use them in the future. I highly recommend these cards to any one.
4893,Good storage for my 10.1 megapixel camera.  I can store an entire vacations worth of hi res photos without having to d/l to my laptop.  This was a better price with Company A than I could find in any store.
4894,"Thought I'd ordered wrong type of card for my new DSLR camera, manual was 'fuzzy&#34; on max size SDhc card camera would accept.Contacted seller, said just don't accept from USPS and they'd refund asa they recd.As it happens I opened in error and thought &#34;try it&#34;. Go Figure it works great !!!Great response from seller  absolutely do business with them again!!!!"
4895,"I purchased as another SD card for my new Raspberry Pi, since I've been tinkering quite a bit with different OSes (XBMC variants, etc.)  This card works great!"
4896,"This is a perfect SD card for use with your Wii. It's not SDHC, so it's fully compatible with everything you may want to do with it - and more than you'd think, you'll end up bringing your SD card with goodies on it to friends' places."
4897,This is an excellent Flash Memory Card which give you plenty of room to take pictures and not worry about running out of space.It holds your photos and then helps transfer your photos to your computer when you're ready.
4898,"...is what I would write here if that was actually possible. Instead, you'll be happy that it works great and is dirt cheap. Looking for a 32Gb SD card? This is the one you want."
4899,"Got this to go with the Kodak Easyshare C1505 camera I got for my niece, great upgrade and pleanty of space at a good price."
4900,It's an 8 gig card that works with HDHC capable stuff...  what more is there to say.
4901,"Yep, it holds my pictures just like a memory card should. Thanks for asking. Would buy this one again. It will hold thousands of memories."
4902,"It's perfect! Gets the job done. Also for a good price, so if you're needing an SD card get this! No complaints at ALL!"
4903,I needed this to replace the wheels and refill the supplies for my Optifix CD cleaner.  The kit contains parts and supplies that are identical to the originals.
4904,"This speaker/docking arrangement is great. I have 3 of them placed around my home. The sound is good, the volume goes loud enough for daily use. I have used mine daily for about 13 months without any problem of any kind. If you already have a main stereo system I would suggest the Kensington dock that will play your iPod right through you system. Otherwise get this JBL. I also use my JBL when I go a friend's home who doesn't have an iPod."
4905,This is a great productPros:-Cheap-works well-easy set up (plug and play)-connect multiple ones together-fast shippingCons: None
4906,"Perfect Addition to my tool box, fits perfectlVender was spot on with his description of the product in his ad.y, and received quickly."
4907,I keep this in my laptop case for those lazy days when I want to just lay back and play point and click games/surf the web. Not an every-day mouse but perfect for casual use.
4908,"I bought these not to connect two cables together, but to use with my Fluke Network Microscanner 3.Normally, you have network jacks you can plug the remote transceivers into. But what do you do when the other end is just a cable with an RJ45? You buy one of these two mate the two.Works great for that purpose to help map out and identify your network -- especially if your predecessors didn't leave detailed patch panel diagrams."
4909,"Geek that I am, I was looking for a more customized thumbscrew but simply couldn't find anything reasonable priced online and Company As selection of thumbscrews wasn't impressive.  This was the most reasonable priced ones with shipping.Ordered it on friday, received it USPS on monday, and was able to crack open my case on wednesday to change things out.Some thumbscrews have screwdriver groves on the top for some reason.  These don't (but why would you need that?).  Just gold plated and hollow on the inside."
4910,X10 does not have the greatest range but for remotely controlling lamps and for an alert buzzer I made they work great.
4911,"I just replaced my older Linksys 54G with this upgrade, and it great! I think I had my older one for at least 10 years and it was still kicking, but liked to drop the connection every so often. It was constantly disconnecting our PS3 and other wifi devices. Even when I plugged the ethernet cord into the PS3, it still dropped the connection at least once a day.I tried some fancy stylistic type routers and kind of had a hard time connecting and setting up the security. So I went old school and upgraded with the familiar, albeit bulky Linksys, it's perfect! We've been using it for about a month now and not once has the wifi or ethernet cord dropped. The signal is strong, and we have no problem using our devices all over the house, we have upwards of 7+ devices connected (via wifi) pretty much all the time and we have no problems with dragging or buffering.I did an internet search to set the security features on this router and I found a youtube vid by some guy who did a step-by-step to set a router key and password, I really love when people take the time to do that. This is a trusty old bus of a router and it works well, I recommend it."
4912,"Helpful! &#34;There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.&#34; 1 John 4:18"
4913,"With this little Router the only thing that can hinder you getting the absolute maximum potential is your knowledge of Networking and Linux scripting skills. Once you load a 3rd party firmware (I used DD-WRT V23 sp2) it totally unlocks the power horse within the router hardware. Even if you decide to stick to just using the stock firmware it is still better than the newer versions of the WRT54g and gs (It's worth the little extra money, especially if you are a novice to Wireless Networking).No Real Cons, I just wish the 3rd party firmware came with a detailed manuel (Thats the price you pay for free firmware).I originally got this for my sister-in-law back in September 06 for her wireless network (My main router is a WRT54GS ver 2.1, The last of the best of the orginal WRT54Company G!)after days of research on different sites, The overall conceus from the sites I looked at was this model. This is my 3rd one that I have purchased (All 3 from Company A), One for my Next door nieghbors to use as a Client bridge, it is replacing the Linksys junk reapter that I was using. This current one I am using for a client bridge in my kids room,That is replacing the ethernet Linksys bridge (WET54GS5) that has some real major issues but is for whatever reason still working (But can not no longer be configured)."
4914,Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router  (Compatible with Linux)This is an excellent router. Easy to install. Works great.
4915,"I bought this router about 3 weeks ago to upgrade my Linksys BEFW11S4 802.11b router. The main thing I was looking for is the stability. So far, this router has been perfect, it hasn't dropped the connection yet. It also appears this router has much better range than my previous router. The product comes with a CD which has the installation guide on it. As usual, it's not well written.Update:It has been more than 3 months since I set up this router and I haven't had any problem. - 8/16/06Update:This router has been in operation for 7 months and hasn't had any problem at all. Not even a single reboot. - 1/16/07"
4916,"Buying a router should be difficult.  It should take hours to set up.  It should require some cursing.  This one I plugged in, followed a few directions, and it was working. Of this router i am no longer a doubter."
4917,"This is great. I wanted to use it for external speakers (I ordered a docking station online at Company A and stupidly didn't realize that it was all USB ports and no other connections, so I had to get extra connectors for everything) and they work perfectly."
4918,"BUT, it does support more weight than other similar products . . .  and in fact, for me, it's supporting a monitor even a little heavier than than it claimed to be able to handle.  Adjustablility is great."
4919,"This fan is not the black fan pictured in this listing.  It is white, and comes with a silver case-slot mounted speed controller.  I realized this after ordering it, but the fan has worked out fine.  I put a spare jumper on the speed controller connection and plugged it into my baybus speed controller.  It works fine this way.This fan replaced a 2 year old Aerocool fan which was starting to come apart and get noisy because the fan blade is molded as 2 pieces.  The Silverstone is about the same price and moves more air.  The Silverstone's fan blade is molded as one piece, and feels more solid.This fan is rather loud when cranked up all the way, but most users will pot it down.  It lowered the temperature of my system, hard drives, CPU, and video card by about 5 degrees Fairenheit.  The sound level is very reasonable for a gamer case, and I'm very please with it."
4920,Great my cpu hasn't overheated since i got this ... even on my 12 hrs gaming run
4921,"2 years ago I bought this product along with my ThinkPad T60 and it worked perfectly without any issues full desktop experience with my laptop before this I always use to have a desktop + a notebook now just a ThinkPad notebook will do 2 years later I upgraded my ThinkPad from T60 to T61 and the docking still works 100% this is a great solution from Lenovo to us ThinkPad owners, all in all a high quality product that deserves more than 5 stars!"
4922,Used these two barreries on a big Fourth of July parade and the related events without a problem. Took well over a thousand pictures.
4923,"I always thought HP made the best DVD's money could buy, so I was disappointed when our Staples store quit selling them.  Then I discovered them on Company A for a great price and all was well again =)"
4924,"Bought this to carry with me on my trips.  It takes up less space in my backpack than the charger the Headset came with.  Don't worry that the cable isn't long enough, this one could connect to an outlet on the moon."
4925,"Typically the loudest thing in your PC is the CPU fan.  When I set about to make my PC quiet for the living room the CPU fan had to go.  Enter the CNPS9500, a truly outstanding product from Zalman.I attached this fan to an external power supply for testing and was amazed at the mass of air being pushed through the heatsink blades while there was nearly no noise at all.  Comparatively my Intel heatsink fan that came with my P4 HT screams like a jet engine.  More realistically it sounds rather like a dust buster set on low.  Regardless that amount of constant noise can become grating.The installation was very simple on my ASUS P4P800 Motherboard.  The heatsink is a bit heavy so I was prepared for the worst.  Apparently on some AMD boards you must install a support plate on the opposite side of the motherboard which almost certainly means removing the board from the PC case.  Fortunately for me th CNPS9500 attaches to the standard heatsink brace found on motherboards for socket 478.Cooling appears to work well.  My CPU does operate at roughly the same temperature as before.  Perhaps on a few occasions the temperature is down by a few degrees.  I would imagine that the sheer size of this cooler would appeal to overclockers because the heat dissipation probably has enormous potential.A not-so-obvious benefit of the CNPS950 in most PC cases is that the fan is oriented perpindicular to the motherboard so it will help blow air toward the rear exhaust fan or out through vents.I purchased a Zalman VF700 for my video card at the same time as the CNPS9500.  The two Zalman heatsinks are finely crafted and look like they meet some exacting tolerances.  Both of them are very quiet and made me realize how loud the fan on my power supply is now that it's not being drowned out by my old CPU fan.Some of the edges are a little sharp.  I think it isn't from poor manufacturing but rather because the blades are fairly thin and there are many of them, smoothing them individually would be an expensive process I'm sure.Nearly a perfect product.  Before purchase check the dimensions and verify that you have enough room in your PC for the CNPS9500.  Also consider that some motherboards will require you to access the area of the board behind the CPU making it likely you will need to remove the board from your PC to install this heatsink.It may also be heavy enough to wreck a poorly constructed motherboard."
4926,never thought this product would be so cool until i went to the far corner of my home and changed the tv channels on my box on the other side of the house. This is kind of over kill but it is still cool. I can now play tricks on people watching tv on the inside of my house while I change the channels from my back yard.
4927,I've had this for over 4 years. It's still working. I purchased additional transmitters. It works great through walls. Recommeded
4928,"Needed to operate a TV in the basement from a IR cable box in an upstairs room.  After a few minutes hooking it up it worked perfectly.  We placed the antenna on the floor of the upstairs room under a dresser and it worked a lot faster than when placed on the dresser itself, so some experimentation might be in order.  The Next Gen is the perfect solution for anyone having to deal with IR issues."
4929,"This EyeCup needs some modification to really fit in the EOS 20D, by either cutting or filing off a piece of plastic.After that, it works well.  Bright and make the view finder bigger, as big as the full frame view finder.Recommended for those who prefer a larger view through the view finder."
4930,"I have used the Panasonic Pro Quality DV tapes for years.  I have used other brands but the Panasonic are goodquality, better than most brands."
4931,"I can not believe how easy this remote is to set up.  I did all the set up while playing Gears of War online.  If I died (rare) or in between matches, I would continue with the setup.  It really was easy.  I love the Activities.  Pure Genius!  Works perfectly with the 360 (obviously) and all my other devices.  I can't stress enough - if you are on the fence for a remote like this, get it!  You won't regret it.  I am 6'5"" and have huge hands and have no problems at all using any of the buttons on the remote.  I love it.  kthxbai"
4932,I am really enjoying the cables having sound and USB and video together is great. I may need to purchase more in the future.
4933,"Got this from Company A when a sale was on ($30 cheaper that the $149.99 listed price) and really got my money's worth--it even came with the USB cable (a real bonus!).Best feature of all is that it can be (if necessary) a stand-alone functional unit without the use of a computer. All printer and maintenance functions can be accessed both via the computer and the control panel on the machine. Had a little trouble with the installation with Vista, but called support and they sent a new disk out right away that worked perfectly in both XP and Vista. The reproduction quality is FANTASTIC. You can even choose print quality as well from the control panel and/or computer on every function!This is a wonderful value. I have yet to find any problems. Having come thru some terrible compatibility issues with HP every time there is an OS upgrade because half the functionality of the HP printers and scanners are inevitably tied to software, and the software is almost never compatible with the new OS--HP's solution: upgrade your hardware. My solution: buy a lexmark!The Lexmark website is also very helpful, and I notice that other software packages for older printers are updated for new OS as well. There is even a downloadable Lexmark toolbar that works in IE 6 and 7 which is a great and handly little tool.The print quality on black and white is excellent, and the color printing is very good as well. Note: If you want you can choose (again on the machine or on computer) to print either in black and white or color. With HP there was no such choice.Fax and scan quality is very good, although the quality is dependent on the quality of the original document (as it is with any fax or scan). One real advantage here is that since this lexmark is an injet printer, faxes are private--no one can get the carbon ribbon from the fax machine (like in older faxes) and read your private materials.Photo printing is seamless, and it even uses the same color cartridge as my other lexmark dedicated photo printer. Pic-bridge compatible works like a breeze and there is a card slot for XD cards (Fuji and Olympus digital cameras), whereas some computers with built-in card readers do not have the ability to read XD cards. Since I own both Fuji and Olympus cameras, this is also another great bonus.My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that the printed page really shoots out quick. So if you forget to put up the page stop, it shoots out of the printer and onto the desk...The software is very intuitive, organized well, and extremely functional.All-in-all, this all-in-one is one way to get maximum bang out of your buck!!!"
4934,I was running out of space on a 6 year old XP laptop with a 40 gig drive.  This was an easy way to nearly double to disk space.
4935,"This worked great for me. I installed it in my wife's Jeep. Expect a control like a disc changer; it's very rudimentary but it was nice and easy enough that my wife did not get frustrated with it. It worked as intended. A tip: if you are only getting sound on one side of the car, push your AUX cable in the rest of the way. I had a little snag with some AUX cables that were very tight fitting, causing me to believe they were plugged in when they were not."
4936,"Just for the record, as I don't see any previous reviews noting it: this Arkon stand works just fine with the compact dimensions of the Nook Touch. It's stable enough to hold the Nook firmly for either touch-screen or button manipulation. (For that matter, although it's no optimized for smart-phone dimensions, it works pretty well holding an iPod Touch for hands-free use.)"
4937,"I have a cover/stand that I use all the time. However, I am in medical school and we have to take exams on our iPads and cannot use a cover. So I take my cover off and use this tripod stand for exams. Works great! You can adjust the tilt of the screen and the wide angle of the bottom two legs. Great purchase, worth the money!"
4938,"I gave my iPad 2 to my dad, when I got my new iPad. Because I wanted to keep my previous accessories, like my smart cover and dock connector, we decided to buy separate accessories for the iPad 2.  We went off with several items including a 3rd party smart cover; it was cheaper like that. The only problem with that smart cover is that any time you wanted to stand it up to use with a keyboard, the iPad would fall backwards.So we went looking for a stand, and we found it. We got the perfect solution for or our dropping problem at a great quality and price.Sturdy!Compact!Doesn't feel cheap!Doesn't slide back!Holds iPad with or without bulky covers!You couldnt really get a better stand for the price!"
4939,"Product shipped quickly and was exactly as described. Great product and does what it is supposed to do. Folds up very nicely and I put it in my tablet carry case with the tablet. Adjust to an infinite number of angles for viewing.I'd recommend it, especially for larget tablets."
4940,"This purchase might be my biggest surprise of 2013! Honestly, I don't usually get excited over writing a review, but this stand is perfect for my iPad Air at my office - and it has rubber feet everywhere it touches my iPad which is quality I wasn't expecting. Worth the purchase!"
4941,"This stand is fully adjustable, and is perfect for both my Kindle and Sony-950 e-readers. You can adjust the little leg brackets to any width, the first available being just right for either device. You can adjust the back to any viewing angle.I have both my Sony and Kindle in a cover, and I leave the cover on when I read. I just let the front cover hang open while having the e-reader sit on the brackets.This stand is very lightweight, and folds down to a mere 7"" x 1.25"" x 1""."
4942,Easy peasy! I slip it on my Canon 430EX when needed. It diffuses my flash nicely. And its rather inexpensive to boot. Makes for an overall good value.
4943,"When used to bounce flash from a ceiling, this product does work.  However, when I use it as a direct flash (90 degree angle) it produces shadows and a dark output.  I don't know why.  I would assume it would diffuse the light and produce even tones."
4944,"This is a neat lens! The reviews mostly all say that and I do too!  You can just move in close, auto or manual focus, then BAM! Another really sharp image. Also works great as a 'regular'  100 short tele- lens.I do not believe you can beat it for the  price or probably any price."
4945,"I've been using these headphones nearly every day of the week for more than 4 years.  I listen to a wide variety of music, but the majority of the time I listen to talk radio.  There is no music I've come across that doesn't sound better in these headphones than any other headphones I've tried.  Yes they look goofy, and since I wear these at my lab bench at work, I get plenty of odd looks and smiles.  However, these headphones sound amazing, and the fact that they've held up for more than 4 years of daily use is a testament to their quality construction as well.As noted in some other reviews, these fit best on people with large heads.  They fit me perfectly and I typically wear a 7 5/8 or 7 7/8 hat.  The ""wings"" and large ear pads make for an incredibly comfortable fit.  I can wear them for hours on end and they don't become uncomfortable.One thing worth pointing out, is that they do NOT block out external noise at all.  This was a bonus for me as I'm often interacting with people in the lab, and I don't have to constantly remove the headphones so that I can hear what's going on.I recommend these to anyone that wants great quality sound at a reasonable price point.  And doesn't mind wearing giant purple/beige headphones of course."
4946,"The Midland AVPH3 are awesome headsets, especially for the price. They look and feel great and the audio is also on par. They're not great for loud environments, the throat mics work much better for that. These work on a lot walkie talkies you will find at major retailers (which use the S2 style 2-pin jack), but they don't work on a lot of HT (handy talky) HAM radios such as Kenwood, Baofeng, Wouxun, etc, this these use the Kenwood K1 style 2-pin jack. The size and spacing is different between the S2 / K1 mic/phone plugs so that they're not compatible between radios. In short order, Midland headsets don't work with Kenwood radios and visa-versa. Take a look at the picture I uploaded in the item photos to get a better idea of what I'm talking about."
4947,"Pros: When you receive the bag, it looks cheap, and when I checked the fit of the radio in the kit when outside my car's dashboard, I worried that the fit would not be tight enough, and that the back of the radio would be supported well enough. However it was very easy to install, fits perfectly in my Mazda 626 dashboard, and looks good.Cons: If I had a double-DIN radio, I would probably be miffed that I had to do some cutting... but I don't :-) Also, I think that ~$15 seems a bit steep for a few pieces of plastic. But given that it worked well, I would buy one of these again."
4948,"Great deal. Not sure what all the complaints are about regarding too many coasters. I never have a failure. Perhaps if the DVD drive is dirty, any brand of disk will fail occasionally. Personally I have been using and buying DVD-R type for many years, always buying on lowest price and regardless of brand. I rarely get coasters. I think these DVD's are all made by only a very few manufacturers and then labeled accordingly."
4949,"Even though my camera has optical image stabilizer, sometimes, like when taking night pictures, I need a tripod for no-blur photos. This tripod does the trick. Great asset & big help in picture-taking!!"
4950,"Bought this remote for our bonus room.  It replaced five different remotes.  Now my daughter and her friends do not have to keep up with all five remotes.  It was a little testy to set up, but customer support was alright."
4951,"I recieved the wireless addapter very quickly. I wasn't sure that such a small adapter would be as good as it is but I was pleasently surprised. It was very easy to install. I had my desk top system switched over to a wireless system within minutes of removing the addapter from the box. It was very easy to install, just placed the CD into the comuter and followed the simple instructions.  I definitely recommend this product if ypu are looking for a simple way to change a nonwireless system over."
4952,"These arrived on time and work as expected.  Simple product and can't go wrong with purchasing them.  Seem to be very heavy duty for the wiring, so should be able to handle any appliance or device that you need."
4953,"I purchased these to connect DJ light cords to an Elation Sc8 System 8 Channel Lighting Control System mounted in a ATA type Flight case. The case was too difficult to reach into to connect the light cables, so with these I only have to connect at the rear edge of the case. Safety strapping the extensions into place to prevent accidental un-plugging is advisable.When I received these extensions, I checked them with an outlet testor to insure proper wiring. No issues were found.The cable housing looks and feels very durable. I expect to get a long service life out of them.I would recommend this product to friends and family without reservations."
4954,I use these at my church to quickly plug/unplug our guitar effects units. They allow us to be able to do this without flipping open the floor panels.  Of course they also don't take up the space at the plug-level that big adapters would occupy. Very handy!
4955,"I purchased the fm direct adapter after hearing/reading about the low signal from the xm fm modulators and this product did exactly what it is advertised to do.  Installation was simple (my radio has the din pins to remove it) and it only took about 15 minutes start to finish.  I have not wired in the included cigarette lighter plug yet, but that will make the installation all under the dash for the xm radio.  The sound quality is good with no interference."
4956,"Pros: Music, Videos and photos run with extreme clarity and sound. Video playback in High Definition. Awesome build quality, attractive interface, supports almost every format on earth.Cons:Trying to find one.. None yet !!Full user opinionI got this as a B'Day gift and was stunned with the clarity of the video and photos.. Let me tell you i was a fan of it even before owning it.. I had been seeing the review and tracking this product ever since its launch.. I was impressed when i could see people giving it very good reviews all over the internet.Now i got this a week earlier as a gift.. Let me tell you my experience. First thing u'll notice when you open the box is its elegent and beautiful built quality.. Then when you charge it up and start, you cannot resist shouting out a ""WaOoooW"", looking at its High definition screen.. Its simply awesome.. I like the fact that Creative had pre-loaded a lot of videos and photos so that that you could right away experience the excellent quality of the device..I ran through a few of the preloaded videos and photos. The video qualityis beyond words.. The sound is crystal clear.. I trid to pump up the volumn to test for any noise.. but could'nt find any till it hit the 21 mark on the volumn. I couldnt get any higher coz i know that would have damaged my ear-drum!!!I immediately loaded all my songs in my laptop (Around 5GB).. i didnt have a idea of how large 30 GB is untill i saw that all my songs could occupy only one-sixth of the memory. I spent the next day listnening to the songs and checking the options.. The FM works well too.. and recording FM also would be interesting (though couldnt find time to check that out). The options are great.. You can rate your songs while hearing them and the DJ option allows you to play the most favourite and also rarely heard songs also, so you dont forget any song in your 10GB or so song chest!!The manual equalizer and the presets are really good. Has an option of adding on the Bass Boost which is great if you love it..Now i dont wanna disappoint the video ipod users, but my friend has one and we comparerd the video and photo quality.. I cant resist saying this that the ipod's video quality looked like a 1998 JVC TV with a VCR, in comparision to the HDTV quality of a Plasma in the Zen Vision M.Two things you would like to note.. Charging the Zen would be tedious with the USB cable plugged to ur laptop. Get a wallcharger, its not expensive. I got it for $16 online and helps you a lot while travelling and saves a lot of time. Its a very worthy investment for your ZVM.. Also consider buying a case to protect your valuable investment.All said, the experience is really great, and i feel proud to own it. You will never be diappointed with it, infact you'll feel really proud to possess it.. I highly recommend it to anybody who plans to go for a hard drive player with video.. A very good job by Creative.P.S... A well deserved victory for the ZVM at CES 2006.. ""Best in MP3 and Portable devices"" category and also a ""Best in Show Award"".."
4957,"I've owned my black Creative Zen player for about a month now. It took a while to get use to - but so did my other mp3 players. The battery life is decent, I could work a full shift (10.5 hrs) without fear of the battery dying.. and part of the next day if I forgot to charge it. I have about 2,000 songs on it right now and havent had any problems with it. Windows Media Player is so much easier to use then my last nightmare of Sonic Stage. The sound is amazing on it, and the volume goes fairly loud. The display is the most amazing thing about it, the colors are so bright.. but it also kills your battery. I almost always have my player set at the lowest dimness possible except when I want to show it off. I enjoy having a radio and being able to record directly from it and the reception works just fine for me.Onto the dislikes.. the black scratches like no other. I was extremely careful with it and it scratched so easily. I did find a silicone type of case for it on Company A, but the damage had already been done. I did however drop the player from about 4 to 5 feet onto the cement recently and this thing is durable (pushed off a counter - wouldnt recommend it!). Ive never owned a harddrive based player before, but you can tell the difference. Theres a slight delay while switching between songs and a longer delay when choosing to randomnly play all songs. These things really didn't bother me when weighed against the pros of this player. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
4958,"Great transaction and product delivered on time or beforehand and  excellent condition, well wrapped."
4959,"I had a Garmin eTrex that worked pretty well here in the Colorado foothills and mountains but often would fail me in heavy timber and in some of the ravines and gulches. Finally it began to give me a hard time finding satellites on top of the hills and it was time to upgrade.This model doesn't have the barometric altimeter or the compass like the 60Csx but in my opinion, you don't need them either. Satellite acquisition is very fast and very good. It even picks up satellites when I am in my house!!! (No lie, I couldn't believe it and I don't live in a tent with a thin roof either) The large color screen is easy to read, the functions are plentiful and seem intuitive. It does everything I need it too and it does it quite well. The SD cards are easy to change and it comes with a USB cable for connecting to your computer. We have an Apple and Garmin has all the necessary Apple software on their web site so you don't have to be an orphan if you're into Mac's. It hooked right up and downloaded and installed all the software quite easily.I am so happy with this 60Cx and would recommend it to anyone that plans on getting into the back country where satellite pick up can be quite finicky."
4960,This product appears to be well built. The cable unwinds and retracts quite smoothly. Very compact and fits nicely in my tablet computer accessory kit. The smaller than usual plugs are just large enough to be fully functional without being bulky. A very nice addition to anyone's accessory kit!
4961,"Two things I absolutely love about this camera:  the metal casing and the large, beautiful screen."
4962,"I've shot photos for almost 45 years.  . . . started very early. The bottom line is the Canon 30D has excellent build quality, superb low light performance, excellent features and most of all superb picture quality in both ideal and non ideal lighting.I shot a lot of low light pictures and compared the Nikon 80, the Canon 30D and 40D and to my eyes, the Canon 30D simply rendered the sharpest, most noise free images in lower light levels.I owned 3 Canon EF lens. The 50mm f1.4, the 70-300mm IS lens and the Canon 28-135MM IS lens. All of these lens deliver excellent pictures in low light, provide sharp images and focus quickly and accurately. I tend to be a strong believer in Nikon and Canon because of the bench strength of their great lens.The only downside of the 30D is it lacks live view. In my opinion this is of limited if any value. To some, this feature might be important, but be aware that live view depletes the camera's battery pretty quickly.Even thought this camera is discontinued, it is well worth seeking out."
4963,Easy to install and worked just fine. Does exactly what its suppose to do. If you need it GET IT!
4964,"I ordered my Kodak Z612 a few weeks ago here on Company A. So far I'm really happy with it. The colors are brilliant, focus is pretty spot on and the zoom is simply amazing. I've still got to sensibly fool around with the manual settings (meaning that I've already done some random fooling around with interesting results).Keep in mind this is not a pocket fit and is aimed towards people who take their photography seriously or are developing a serious interest in this field.The screen is a major fingerprint magnet and I now regret taking off the thin plastic sheet over the screen. Another negative I noticed is that during video recording the mic picks up a lot of sound from the zoom motors and that there is substantial blurring while you are zooming during a video shoot. I'm not sure if these are standard problems that come with video recording with digicams but its not a major issue for me; since I only use it to shoot 1-2 minute clips of my son. I also turned off the Continuous Focus option in favor of One Time Focus since the lens would constantly be adjusting and readjusting and making sounds at every slight movement and it would no doubt be the source of major battery drainage.The zoom on this thing is awesome and image stabilization plays a major role at 12x zooms; in fact it would be pretty useless without it.All in all its an excellent camera. Just make sure you purchase a 1gb SD card to go with it (if not more) and a camera bag since it doesn't come with one."
4965,"It works very well for burning or playing, I'm really pleased with this drive and would buy it again. It come with Nero express which is OK but it should have come with the full version?"
4966,"This will blow your ear drums, it gets pretty loud. Bass is excellent, sound quality is 9 out of 10 as compared to Bose QC2.Trushar Mistry"
4967,"I recently listened to music with these for 5 hours straight and got to know them well.  These babies are awesome.  The highs are bright, the mid-range is excellent and the low-end/bass is very good.  I'm amazed they can produce sound of this quality in such a small device.  Bose and Klipsch have nothing on these things.  And it bares repeating, the bass is VERY GOOD - almost THX quality.  Taking further into account the price of these things and we're talking BEST BUY."
4968,"this summer i was to travel to Palestine and attend a wedding . the last thing i wanted was to hall around an ostentatious camera that would break my back as well as be a problem at check points and border crossings.i picked the Sanyo Xacti C6. it was great. the size is amazing, its as big as my cell phone, and i laughed at first becasue i didn't find it when i opend the  box.the video quality is great, **FOR IT'S SIZE** i was expecting the picture to be realy blurry and pixulated but it wasn't that bad, and more suprizing is the indoor videos at night. However, the still picture capabilities is inferior to the movie capabilities. and don't even think of taking a picture at night.On my trip the camera fulfilled its duties with flying colors. But then my family used it to film a highschool graduation...boy was that a disaster. movies of the wedding weren't very celebrated, but the behind the scenes were great. again don't use it for family moments!now you might say why should i buy a flawed camera for that price, its because you will use it maybe 1000x more often than a regular bulky video camera. many a times did i capture great vacation moments with this camera in situations where a bulky camera wouldn't have been carried, just because this one can be placed in the pocket of your pants."
4969,"Finally Logitech has made a keyboard and mouse, wireless to boot, that is made for a mac and then some. This keyboard has been a great upgrade to the old Apple issue keyboard. It is aesthetically beautiful and works well with my Power Mac.The mouse has wonderful extras and is almost as good as the MX 1000. This one on the other hand has a few keys that are very useful like the volume and forward and backward buttons. It is shaped quite ergonomically and is light as well.The keyboard feels really good with the keys easy to reach and flowing quite good.  The one thing here that would of been better would be if it was a natural keyboard in this same style. All of the features that the Apple issue has and more are on this keyboard.All in all this keyboard is well worth the price."
4970,"I picked up one of these as a gift for my Wife, who occasionally needs to go online but can't always work at a desktop.  When I saw the specs on this laptop, I had to pull the trigger and get one.  It's been the best purchase I've made in quite awhile.The laptop has 2Gb of RAM, which is exceptional for a laptop at this price.  Moreover, the 120Gb SATA drive is also an exceptional, almost impossible feature of a laptop today.  Finally, the dual-core CPU is the final surprise for this price.  Combined, these elements mean I have a machine that's far faster and more capable than all of my desktops and almost as capable as my home server (I'm a systems architect, so I know servers).It's also in possession of some other features that make it a superior value: a wide-screen super bright LCD at 15.4"", a dedicated ATI graphics chip with 256Mb of memory, a dual-layer DVD burner, an SD/MMC/MS card reader, 4 2.0 USB ports, a Firewire port, and two killer radios.Killer radios?  Sure.  802.11 a/b/g Wifi, and Bluetooth 2.0.  The range on the wireless connection is very good, and although I haven't tested Bluetooth fully, it syncs easily with my Nokia 3650.The bundle of software is minimal but functional.  There's no MS Office here, and XP Home is your OS.  For this price, I wouldn't dare complain.  Its intended use is the couch, so recharging it is not an issue and the wide screen makes browsing a treat.  The keyboard layout is rational if unconventional, and your right thumb can page up/ down rather easily, making the lack of a scroll wheel somewhat easier to take.Should you buy it?  I'd recommend it, although I might say that waiting for a sale is a smart idea.  Still, this is near-perfect and only the fact that it isn't a Tablet PC keeps it from being my dream machine.-Fred"
4971,I bought this so i can play my ipod or phone through my car..such a clear transmitter. best one by far!
4972,I don't how I got along with out it. For better white balance and better color and Black & white pictures it is tool that no studio should be without.
4973,"I got this to connect a Nuforce uDAC 2 to my Acer C720 Company H.  The cable supplied with the uDAC was pretty long and I wanted something shorter.  Works great, and the price was right.  It seems well built, I just wish it was a touch more flexible."
4974,"I was torn between these and the new SE210s.  I used to own a pair of these and loved them.  And that first pair was $200, and well worth it.  Also owned a pair of e2-c's.  Always preferred the sound and the feel of these over the e2-c.  At present Company A prices, the cost of these e3-cs are about the same as the old cost of the e2-c's, so the value is there.When comparing these to the SE210s, I opted for these for two reasons:1. These were familiar to me2. The new SE210s have a short cord and an extension cordThe short cord is ideal if you place your mp3 player around your arm at the gym.  I don't do that with my iPod classic, so I didn't want to deal with a second cord connection.Also, it should be noted that these e3-c's are shipping under their new name, SCL3.  I ordered these e3-c and received a SCL3.  They are the same headphones.  Reading message boards I've discovered that the SCL3s have one new set of foam earbuds that the e3-c's didn't, so rest assured if you buy some e3-c's and get an SLC3 instead."
4975,These earphones are the best I've auditioned and really block out the background noise.  You don't need 'active noise cancelling earphones' with the extra weight and hardware.  These simply block out the background noise and sound superb.
4976,I've been using this card for a little over a month and haven't had any problems with it. The picture Quality is awsome! A must have for any Media Center Pc's.
4977,"The Sennheiser earbud headset is a top notch product.  I ordered that item and the Creative Labs EP630 together to compare, and the difference is night and day.  The Sennheiser sound crisp and clear.  The Creative Labs earbuds sound washed out.  Both are new so no burn-in has been done.  The price was almost the same for the two.Previously, I owned the Etymotic Research ER6i.  That was also an excellent earbud headset; however, it costs nearly three times as much as the two mentioned so it's not fair to compare."
4978,"I've owned this pair since April 2009. This is my first in-ear sound isolating type of earphones. With that said, my comparison with these CX300's are the $9.99 Philips earphones and the earphones supplied with the Apple iPods.These really do a great job of minimizing ambient noise and greatly improves the clarity of the music. For my ears, it has a flat frequency response and they are true to the sound. When listening to Frank Sinatra songs, I am confident that there is no coloring in his voice. With jazz tracks that I play, you can hear the clarity of the cymbals and the hit of the congas.These come with three sets of removable rubber buds. You have to test all three for the best fit. If the fit is not good, there is no bass and the highs would not be clear. Fortunately, I fit into the middle (default) pair. At first, the J-cord design was weird but I got used to it. I felt that this J design made the CX300's stay in my ear better because my shoulders/neck supports the cord and no hanging cord pulls the buds out from my ears. I tried these on an airplane going to and from Las Vegas and they were very good at lowering the plane's engine noise while I was listening to my tunes.The Sennheiser CX-300 is a great pair below $25 to use for a lot of purposes. Go to the gym, listen in the airplane, use it at the laundromat or the park, you can't go wrong. Try 'em out!"
4979,"Recently, I got hit by lighting in my house killing one of my hard drives.  The pictures of my daughter were in there and I thought I was going to lose everything.I ordered this little tool and used it to retrieve the data from that bad drive.Overall, I got this because of its versatility, it accepts:3.5 IDE drives3.5 SATA drives2.5"" SATA drivesIt's a great little device.It's really two cables.  The first is an adapter from IDE/SATA to USB and the second is a power supply to power up a drive.This is most definitely not a permanent solution - for that try a hard drive enclosure likeAntec MX-100 3.5-Inch USB Aluminum Enclosure for SATA Hard Drivebut if you need to triage a drive, apply an image to a hard drive or something like that -- this is a MUST HAVE tool.It saved the pictures of my toddler.To prevent that from happening in the future I'm getting thisWestern Digital ShareSpace 4 TB 4-Bay Gigabit Ethernet Network Attached Storage with RAID 5 - WDA4NC40000N- it's redundant storage that makes loosing data much harder.This little tool comes in a neat little box that's reusable - so don't throw it away when you get it - just store the mangle of little cables in there - ready to help you save somebody's data."
4980,"I'm not sure why I don't see more people using this case.  Instead everyone's using one of those ugly silicone or pouch-style cases.  One of the things that I like about it is that the iPod looks like an iPod in this case.It's perfect and it encloses my 30GB iPod Video like a glove.  The construction and material are solid.  Once you put it on, which is easy to do, the case is very secure.  There are openings, so that the case doesn't interfere with the iPod's functionality -- such as the hold switch, headphone jack, jog wheel, and charge/sync interface.  The case is clear and doesn't distort the color or image on the screen.  Most importantly, it does a great job of protecting my iPod from keys and other articles in my pocket or my backpack."
4981,"After spending lots of time trying to find a replacement XM Radio antenna, I finally found one at a reasonable price. Was a perfect replacement fit. Would recommend buying from this seller."
4982,I needed to replace an under powered Linux server. I used this motherboard with an Intel P4 3.8 HT processor along with the processor I doubled my memory to 4 Gig. It run great. I was very easy to build onto and documentation was great.
4983,"Echoing the sentiments of other reviewers, I can't believe I waited this long to stop overpaying for cables of any kind. For my use, this cable does the job as well as cables selling for much more, so why throw away the extra money?"
4984,I needed these cables to hook my PSP up to a projector. Totally awesome and I'm thrilled to have purchased these!
4985,"12 feet is a pretty good length, and I am having no problems with this. I love it, and the price can't be beat"
4986,"This is a very high quality cable. It has all the right materials, specifically high-performance polypropylene foam dielectric on the signal lines. The connectors are large and solidly molded."
4987,This adapter is just what is needed to connect standard HDMI/ DVI-I digital cable to the DVI-D connector used on many flat panel monitors.  Beware of the 4 or 5 variations of DVI/HDMI cables!  Many look alike at first glance but may be incompatible.  For more information see: [...]
4988,"It works as advertised. This plus a cheap HDMI cable made for a very cheap, and flexible, way of connecting my laptop to my new TV."
4989,"What can I say... it works!It fits my source and target and the cable is 6ft long.I hear great sound, so it seems to be transferring the signal great.I am 100% satisfied."
4990,"I needed a 3.5mm coupler, and this one fit the bill. It was inexpensive, the build quality seems good, and most importantly, it works! What's not to love?"
4991,"The wires have done a good job - wish I could say I hear differences, but I don't have time to run A-B tests.  Having a reel allowed me to custom cut the lengths to what I needed, avoiding having to loop them.  Just make sure you get good plugs that will take these 14 gauge wires."
4992,"The big question that everyone asks when shopping for MP3 players is ""Is it as good as an iPod?"". Since I wasn't about to buy an iPod, this comparison is moot. After lengthy research, I settled on the Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player and I can't imagine the iPod being a better player. The Zen Sleek is a fantastic player.** Hardware **Without giving a laundry list of features, I'll touch on the basics. The Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player is a hard-drive based MP3 player that sports a large 20GB drive. This is a large amount of space especially if you use the more compressed WMA format. Depending on many factors, you can expect to fit about 10,000 songs in 64kbs WMA format or half that in 128 kbs MP3 format. Additionally, the player has an FM tuner with 32 presets.The voice recorder is a fringe feature and I don't anticipate using it much. The microphone is tiny and doesn't record sound very well, so don't expect to use it for more than voice memos.The headphones that ship with the unit are your basic cheap ear buds. They are satisfactory in terms of sound and comfort, but not great. My ears got a little sore from using them after a few hours, but this is often the case with ear buds that are less than ergonomic. As well, the sound was mostly mid tones with no bass and the highs when present were tinny. You're better off buying a good pair of headphones or ear buds. Note that this lack of quality was from the ear buds, not the unit itself. More details on the quality of the unit with good headphones are below.For those who care about the aesthetics, the Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player is an attractive player about the size of a smartphone or PDA. It is solid in hand, but not really heavy. The brushed metal case is very nice and the buttons layout borrows from the iPods minimalist approach. At first blush, some users might balk at the black and white screen. But the trade off is a whopping 20 hour battery. I don't need the color screen and if that gives me an extra 6 hours of battery, I'm all for it. Plus the bright blue backlight gives me just enough of a splash of color.The controls on the front are simple including play, pause, etc. But most noticeably is the strip down the center. This scroll pad is used to navigate up and down in the menus similar to the iPod's scroll wheel. It works very well and the sensitivity is adjustable in the UI. This feature can take some getting used to, but once you do, it is a very effective navigation tool.The Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player is the next in the line of Zen players. The previous players had a detachable battery. Curiously, the Zen Sleek departs from this and has an internal Lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This could be a bad thing if the battery gives out. You'll need to have the whole unit serviced. Luckily, Lithium-ion batteries as a whole are rather reliable.** Sound quality **As noted above, the included ear buds are not very good. That said, I plugged in a pair of Sony studio monitors and the sound was amazing. the Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player boasts a 97dB signal-to-noise ratio. For non-audiophiles, this is the relationship between desirable sound (music) and noise (electric hum, static) and the bigger the number, the cleaner the sound. To test this out, I tried the player using headphones, a Denon home theater receiver and even a tape adapter for my car. All of them sounded as good as my regular CD player, even at the ""inferior"" 64 kbs WMA bitrate. And with 192kbs MP3s, the sound is truly amazing.The Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player supports all flavors of MP3 and WMA including protected DRM protected WMAs. I tested the unit with various bitrate and they all sounded as expected.Additonally, the Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player boasts multiple EQ presets so you can tailor your music sound the way you like it. I tend to leave mine on custom, and your settings will vary depending ,mostly on your headphones. But they're there if you need them.** Software **The Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player comes with the Creative Mediasource software. I installed and used the software for the purposes of this review, but I tend to use Windows media Player since I already have my music catalogued in it. The shipped software works well for ripping and burning. It doesn't have the same pretty interface as iTunes, but seems just as functional. But if you're a windows user, this is a certified Plays For Sure device which means that is should work flawlessly with Windows Media Player.The internal software of the unit is easy to navigate and understand. I've seen the UI for the iPod and the Rio Carbon and the iriver IMP-350 and so far I like the Zen's better. The playlists work flawlessly and it has little features such as being able to find a song by typing in the first letter. It also has a sleep function that shuts off the player after a user-defined interval. Especially helpful when I fall asleep during a particularly boring audiobook. In theory I won't be driving at the time, but I digress....The Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player has a fast USB 2.0 connection used for syncing and charging (with the help of an AC Adapter) and transferring files was speedy using both the Creative software and Windows Media Player.Another fringe feature is the ability to sync up tasks and notes from Outlook. This is a little difficult to get setup, band many won't find it worth the time. I use it simply for my calendar items so I know if I should be at a work meeting or on the treadmill. Most won't use the feature and if you have any other email program than Outlook, you're out of luck. I wouldn't cry over the inability to use this feature.Finally, the Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player can be used as a storage device. A 20 GB removable dive. With the latest firmware update, it is drag and drop capable with no extra drivers needed. This is a very handy feature and I've used it many times to transfer files to and from work.If there was anything to improve on, I would add a better case instead of the silly little bag that comes with the unit. Along those lines, there are practically no accessories available except a docking station. I'm sure that will change.** Conclusion **I love my Creative Labs Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player. With specs that can't be beat and sound quality on par with high end systems, this could be the iPod killer many have been waiting for. Of course, to beat Apple, they would need to actually advertise and perhaps set up mall stores, but that's a different story."
4993,"I have owned my E330  for six months, and I am more impressed all the time.  Its best features:1.  Excellent photographic output, especially when set on ISO100 and shooting RAW.  The colors are very natural, not garish and overdone as on some other DSLRs.2.  The hinged viewfinder is great because you can place the camera on low platforms or other odd places and easily compose.3.  Live view is also a great composition tool.  On a tripod, Live View B lets you use the camera like a mini view camera.4.  With an adapter, you can mount hundreds of older manual focus lenses, and live view B lets you focus precisely.One hint:  skip the 14-45 mm lens.  It was a bit too compromised.  Spend more and buy the 14-54 instead.  However, the old version of the 40-150 lens is very nice, and an incredible bargain at the current price of about $100."
4994,I have many DVD's from Zone 1 and 2 - all are played seamlessly and without problems errors and other interruptions.I play burned CDs and DVDs in various audio and video formats with no problems at all.I'm seriously thinking of buying another one for my other TV.This is my third Toshiba DVD and so far I was always pleased with their products that work well and just last and last
4995,"I've had this for over 4 years, and it's been working quite well.  I have turned off the X band, as it goes off too many times, and 9/10 times, it's a false alarm.  K/Ku bands are the ones to look out for (in my region, at least), and perhaps a laser or two.  I really like that it shuts off a few minutes after you turn off your car; makes my life easier, and saves my battery.  Will definitely get a Cobra for my next one!"
4996,"My wife and I used the FR300 during the week-long Queens blackout this past summer and this little radio delivered. One 2 minute winding lasted for an hour on medium volume. The cell phone charger is cool, but it takes a lot of winding. The light is good in a pinch, but not particularly useful."
4997,"I've had this radio/cassette/cd boombox for 3 years now and it still performs exceptionally.There are many rare features on this unit that have long disappeared from other so-called boomboxes, such as a line input feature and a multiple equalizer/ amplifier system.  It also has a sleep feature (which I've never bothered to use) and has an impressive 4 speaker stereo output.The deal maker for me was the line-input jack (which, as been already stated, is the 1/8 jack.)  This is precisely what you'll need if you're going to connected it to your computer.  I had been sitting on boxes of interviews on cassettes that I had no way of transferring.  This radio instantly gave me the opportunity to digitize the recordings along with software I previously installed.The sound is rich and woofer system is indeed deep.If you're in need of a cassette deck with a line-input but don't want to spend $150+, this is a great alternative.  (I bought mine from BrandsMart in Miami for $69.99 and that was their stock price.)Great deal, nonetheless."
4998,"Nikon products are great, i have used this cleaning product for my lens and camera body twice. The microfiber cloth took off all smudges and the cleaning liquid got rid of all ""fingerprints"" form the lens and body. Very useful to have when travelling, fits nicely into the camera bag. Rate it 10/10"
4999,"I was looking for a tripod that I could take on long excursions in the wilderness, and that means that it needs to be small and lightweight. This fits the bill perfectly. It is very sturdy and will support my Sony a57 with both the standard 18-55 and the 55-200 lenses. It fits nicely in my pack or strapped to the outside."
